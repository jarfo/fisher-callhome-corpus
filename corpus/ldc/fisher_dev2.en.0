Hi, good af-, good evening.
Good evening, it's Norma here, from Atlanta.
Oh, well, would you look at that. I'm from...
Oh, yeah, we're, we're near.
Yes, we're pretty close. ¿Is this the first call you took?
Yes, because yesterday, what happened is that, since i was out, they called me, right?, the, the computer called me, but i wasn't here, so couldn't.
I couldn't answer.
Oh, and, i am on my cellphone, they called me three times, but i was at the store, so i couldn't, you know, take ten minutes to talk.
Sure.
But, ¿where are you from?
I'm from Peru, ¿and you?, oh.
Puerto Rico.
Oh, from Puerto Rico, oh, ok.
Yes, yes.
So
Well, yeah. Uh, they said that we could talk about marriage, or talk about anything.
Yes, and talk about which and stuff, but we have to use the word marriage, i guess.
Oh, ok, well, we used it, right?, ¿are you married?
Yes, I'm married.
Oh, ok.
Eight years ago.
Ah, well, m- it's great.
And you?
No, no.
Ah, you're not married, ah, okay.
No. I was married, but not anymore. yes.
Ah, you're divorced. Ah ok.
Well, have you been in Atlanta for a long time?
yea, te- ten years now.
A- me too. I've been here eleven years, I came here in ninety four to go to college
Ah, I, I came in ninety five.
Ah, okay.
through the church. So, afterwards, here, I got married here.
Well, you can say that, you can say that you're from Atlanta, then.
yes. For the most part.
Pretty much. But, do you go back to, to, to Peru every now and then?
No, since I've been here, I haven't gone back.
Ah, okay.
I haven't gone back. So,
It's hard. Right?
aha
it gets hard, sometimes, one gets enveloped with his own life, and it gets hard to come back from his visited land.
yes, a- and also, too, aside from the, the money, when enough. that's the problem, i think.
well, exactly, yes. i know that, to come back, ah, a, a, a, a flight to Puerto rico, if on sale, is not that expensive. one can get it,
at least, two hundred, two-way.
oh, yes. oh.
but, if it's not on sale, you're paying 500 to 600 per passenger.
oh, yes. it's that... Puerto rico is near here, is it?
yes, it's like three hours from here, flying.
yes, it's near, then. but, i have to go to Peru, it's south a- in south america, so,
yes, well, i guess that, at all, it's then a lot more expensive
oh, yes, it's more expensive, then. it's exp- it's very expensive.
do you have family around here?
no, i came becau- via the temple, I'm from a religious organization. i came because of that.
oh.
and, i guess we should talk more about marriage, right?
well, they said we could talk about anything, but, you know.
hmm.
if you want to talk about marriage, well, we can talk about any marriage.
aham, ok. what marriage do we talk about? let's see.
I don't know, mine lasted three years, and honestly, it was because i married too, you know, too young.
Oh, ok.
And, we hadn't, well, you know, we had the wrong idea
And
Compared to one another. And then, when we started a real life, that
Uh um.
let's say, well, no, we couldn't sustain the relationship.
Oh, yeah, well. And, you had kids from your marriage, ¿right?
No
No, you didn't have kids. Oh
No.
Well, at least, there's, it's, that's a lot of weight. If you  have kids, it's a little more trouble.
No, and we couldn't, you know, we got divorced, but we remained friends, even though it's been years since i heard from him. But you know, we left, you know
Right.
It wasn't ugly, we didn't break up like in hate, or anything like that.
Uh um.
And, i always wish the best for him, but, we just know, we made a mistake, about our age and our maturity when
we did that
Uh um. Oh, yeah, well. To me, well, I'm gonna say, by the grace of God, i'm doing well in marriage.
Yeah, thank God.
yes, there we are with the blessings. No and..
So, that means that you met your husband here. Right?
...yes, yes. I met my husband in the temple where I was living. He
In Atlanta
...belongs to the same religion. Then, we got married there
Am, but. Is he also from Peru?
No, he is American.
Ah. Okay And. Do you have children?
yes. I have two, two boys.
That is nice.
One of them is seven, the other is three.
Ah, G-d bless them.
Ah, nice, thank you, and you too. Let's see, if you find another husband.
I hope that one day, yes.But, if not, you know, I am happy with my life.
Let's see if you go for the second marriage.
yes, let's see, because I said, after this, I said that I didn't want to marry again until I don't know what,
and it is not in my heart that it is going to be forever.
Ah.
It doesn't matter what is coming, I can stand and I can endure it.
Mhm.
So we will see.
Yes. So hopefully, then, we find a better person, right?
Yes. This is the most important
Hmm.
Want it and have faith.
Yes. Let's see, what else shall we talk about? What other married couple should we talk about?
I don't know. Perhaps your parents, are they still in Peru?
Ah, yes. I was in Peru, my mama is in Peru. And no, I don't have a papa.
Ah, okay.
And my siblings, no, my siblings and my mama are there. And your family, where are they?
Ah. Well, Mommy and Daddy moved from there to here after I moved.
Ah, okay. So then they are close.
And, then, my brother also followed me here. And all of them, now I have all my family here.
Mm. Ah, good. I see, very good.
Yes. Mommy lives by the airport. And Mommy and Daddy are coming up, I believe, 35 years this year in December
Ah. Being married?
Being married, yes.
Oh, yes?
Yes.
There they were married, and for eternity.
yes.  They met when, mom is two years older than dad, but they met when dad was eight- fou- no, sorry, fourteen years, and mom had sixteen.
And, they went steady pretty soon afterwards, and since that time until now, they have been together.
Oh, that is great, look.
So, that is a positive marriage which we can talk about.
That really is good. Ehm, yes, yes, It seems that ehm, before, no?  more ancient people didn't have like, th- mm, lasted more in their marriages.  Right?
yes.
Now there is a lot of divorce.
yes.  What happened with, well, you know, of course that my mom loves my dad very much, and that has a lot to do with it.  But also, what happened with my mom, it was that she
Mm.
came from a poor family, a single mom,
Hmm, Aha
and she never had anything that she h- could call like it was, you know, her own
Oh, okay
And then, when she found my dad.  And he was the lo- love of her life, and got married, well, she then had something, her family.  It was,
you know, he belongings.
Aha
And, she it a lot, that's why
Oh, Ah, she, there, she was with him, there, putting up with everything, good and bad.
yes Exactly.  Exactly.
Oh, if yes, that is what happens, yes, wel- my mom, my mom when m- became a widow, because my dad, no, died, then, she did not, did not get remarried.
Ah.
They nunc- never married again she is an old fashion mother no? what did she say i will became a c-i already put up with one, will not put up with another one
No por-but they also say, and maybe Right? for for one,there is only another another soul.
yeah
you know that you get another person.
yes yeah.
and after when you have that person in your life, yes I know if anything happens and that person leaves well you know you have a need to look for anyone, because you were satisfied with that.
yes that is what happens well,each one has a destiny.
yes
Their Karma like we call it in the Vedica philosophy
Ex-exactly, their Karma
yeah you know about Karma ?
Oh, yes
Ah so good
oh yes is very important to know of that,because many people do not want responsibility for their actions and they beleieve not
Mhm
they are not going to pay what they are doing
Mhm
And that's not that way
Yes, that is true. No?  Each one does one, has one, each action has a reaction, and if one acts positively, one also has positive reactions
Exactly
otherwise with negative actions. This is another way to understand to, doesn't?
Exactly
i mean, they are suffering, right?, because of their karmic relations
And i have, i think, my own karma
Mhm
mmm, how do you say?, because of my own spiritual ideas
Oh, OK
But, if you believe in karma cientificaly, as an energy,  energy doesn't create nor destroy
Mhm
then, if you create negative energy, that energy must go somewhere
Mhm
and it is to come back to you, because you created it.
yes, yes, that's true
And, my spiritual point of view is that God created us to have a better life. But you are responsible of your own acts.
Hello.
Hello.
Good night.
Good night, yes my no-, my name is Tami.
Ah, my name is Norma from here in Atlanta, Georgia.
Oh I am from here in Washington, Washington state.
Ah, OK, how are you?
Eh, very well, and you?
Ah, here, yes, well, so so with the children
I was here painting my house.
Ah, OK.
And they called me, I say OK, oh my God.  Then, are you married?
yes, yes, I have two children.
Me too, I
Ah, yes? and two also?
yes, I have two children, well one is nineteen and the other one is fifteen.
Ah, they are already grown, they are already teenagers
Aha, yes.  And the oldest one has already left home.
Ah, yes, he is already independent.
yes, he moved about ten minutes from my house.
Oh, you have recently moved
So then Aja, down from the hill, was already below, so then
Ah, now, and already they, uh, everyone, already you are missing each other, right?
Yes, I miss him. But every once in a while he calls me or comes over here on the weekend to eat or something like that.
Hmm.
Yes. And are you married?
Yes. Yes, I am married.
For how many years?
Eight
Oh, I've got 18 years in November.
Oh, but you see my children are still young, the one is seven and the other just turned three years old two days ago
Ah, yet still I, once in a while, look at pictures of my little boy and say, "My God, where did the time go?"
Yes, time passes very quickly, and you don't even count the years and the children grow.
Yes, yes the other day he was angry with me because I hadn't come out yet, and a man thought he was my husband.
Oh, really?
Because people don't believe how old I am.
Aha.
So then he bravely says I'm not his wife, he's not my husband, this is my mama. I look at you and your small children should be happy that I think your mama looks so young.
but good for Aya, because lately what I've realized also is that people
yes
Here it's very quick to, to get divorced.
Ah, and yes, now, yes.
Nobody wants to work on their marriage.
yes, the couples, now it is very rare that they actually last.
Mhm.
No, now for every little thing, and problem, and then all of a sudden they're separated.
Mhm.
a lot of times they don't
There's no patience
they don't intend to, don't int-, to attempt to improve things in their marriage.
Your ma- Is your husband Latino?
No, he's American/
Mine too.
Ah, yes, mine is brown skinned, American.
Yes, you told me. What?
Mine, is brown skinned, American.
Mine is white, I'm the brown one.
Ah, here I have lighter skin.
Ah
No, my husband's black, no but he's very nice.
Ah, yes. Yes, my husband always tells me, he says thank God because I'm from Panama and he says thank God they sent me to Panama and I met you
Because American women, he says
American women are now, very independent, they want to do, no?
I don't like them, he says, not so much about independence, but that they don't respect marriage
Ah
That's what he says, no, he doesn't say no because I'm, I'm very independent but
Yeah
I always take care of him
Ah, sure, maybe, no, they don't
You know, I don't give him
they don't value things like they used to, no? now it's different, the mindset has changed for, for marriage
No. Hmm, yes, it's so different because my husband works with some young men
Ah
and they, my husband's co-workers are american, no?
yeah
and the women give them like twenty dollars every too weeks for lunches, the rest they keep, that's American women. Then it's power, it's funny, my husband has an Xbox, so they come to my house to play
Yeah
and I laugh, because my husband calls them, it sounds like they're teenagers. Can you play today? and he says no, my wife won't let me, and I laugh, I tell him
and you? Your wife lets you do whatever you want, the others have to, have to, ay, I laugh a lot, I tell him
working all day, at least an hour to relax. No
Ah Yes? very cheap, right?
When my husband goes to luch or something like that i let him go. I tell him go and enjoy it.
He tells me we couldn´t go because his wife didn´t let him go.
Really? The husband is being managed by the wife.
Ok. Totally.
really?
I say no way.
In the Latin society we are used to a have a patriarchal
Mhm
you every now and then one could be have more of an open mind.
I think that men like that when women are a little more flexible. the point is to be happy.
Ok.
That's why I tell those women that men might leave them.
LOL
they have him too tied that the man might look for other place.
divorces
Mhm, but no
Marriage doesn't last.
they don´t understand
the two factors.
Mhm. I say no my husb-, no, my children always laugh because barely it's that if we my husband and I, we don't don't yell at home, and even that if anything that I'm calling to, and, uh
I have a high voice, because I'm on the second floor of the house
Uh huh.
my son says don't fight, I tell him I'm not fighting I'm yelling
It's that if one as a good Latin woman, one a lot of times eh, must, they're used to it, no? to raise her voice
Uh huh, exactly. and my son, I always tell him, and they tell me stop yelling, friend do you want me to tell you when I'm yelling? I'll show you my pa-
Aw, so
Ah.
it's, it's that, a lot of differences
Ah, yes, societies are different, one even though it doesn't seem like it, no? even though it doesn't seem like it at the beginning, but there are a lot of differences really, culture differences, no?
yes, it's it's it's, it's so funny because my husband knows, co-, since I met him, uhm like he didn't know how to dress so well.
Uh huh.
So then I always, I always put the clothes outside for him
Ah, you
in the morning, I say eh, I don't mind, I put it outside for him and how they cause him trouble, at work, and I say well
if he's the only one who looks good at work, why do they cause him trouble?
Uh huh.
I say from all those who go that pants with holes and the women who don't you see and to nowhere and I say my husband I don't cause him trouble and he dresses well, what do you have with, problem with him?
and he starts to laugh, I don't care, that that he says I'm calm with my woman he tells me I tell him well, well ow, no, eh
Sure, yes, I also had one, or have a friend who married an American and he says like how different Latin women are
Mhm
yes, really, he a-, he apreciates a lot, say
And yes, it is that
No, because he, the Latin women are very different no, no, they don't, they don't create many problems
No, and when we love, we love hard
ah, that yes, on is more loyal, I suppose
Aha, that is true
very visible, no? That one is more loyal, really
yes, but here
More, more, a lot more loyalty
Mhm
Mhm
Here not, here does not matter the I have a, a friend of my husband's best friend got married and in five years they were divorced and was that a prostitue and that
other women and I don't know, and I say, Ay my God and we in the middle because I was friend of the wife and of him and my husband his best friend
Aha
Ay God, I said I, don put me in the middle of this ay I that, I, Ay I say dahts is really bad, don't ask me what she said because I am going to tell you
But like that fast
Yes, it is very sad, no? that married couples don't last very long and really if they have kids, the kids suffer a lot.
yes, yes, I have one here, my neighbor next to me
yes
oh, she got married with this man and he had a child of about eight yeirs old, oh, eight years.
Aha
and they had two and this women him, she was him on, to the child on the face
Oh, really?
don't touch my children you are not my son and I don't know what and, and I here I say ah, I would like to grab that kid and bring him here to my house
Ah, poor children.
because I would say she was I sometimes I tell her, the other day I told her you know what I am in my house I don't want to hear your conversation about what, that you are calling your exhusband sirty and I don't know what because you are talking to loud
and your kids I say, poor of your kids that are listening to all of that, those bad things you say about their dad
Hmm.  Sure
and she says ah, don't me
yes, the children suffer, ehm, a lot, they get traumatized when they are very little and have all of those problems, no? in the home
Hmm.
they get traumatized a lot
And kicked out the husband from the house and put another boyfriend there
Hmm.
I say oh my God, you didn't even give him time to, that the man had gotten out of there and he already had another one
Of course.
And that one too, like he yells to the children, like he yells to the children
Oh, yes, it is really a pity, no? that is why there are so many
I say
many times the government removes the children from people like that when they don't handle things well when
Mm, yes that is woman
no, they abuse them psychologically or
does not work
or physical-, or physically
yes, that is true, this woman does not work, the dad pa- her bought the house and gives her money every month
Hmm
buy his, I would think listen, if they give you money every month listen do something, help other persons or something, not just inside the house and and I think that is why she is frustrated.
Oh, yes, well
because she does not anything and with those children that make an effort so badly, I say oh God that I have to scold them because they are also on my, on my side, with that battle and I don't know what
Oh, yes? do they fight hard?
oh oh, and I, with the husband, I did not get along with him
Aha.
I, he came over to, to yell here in my house and I send him to my husband would just look at me, he tells me I have never seen you like that, and I say good since Latin women when you bother them and bother
whe- I don't, it reaches to to the end and you already hear her very well, she starts to laugh.  She says I have never seen you like that, and I say well since because she already had me up to

ha
Because you like moving children, I say because I think they remember more than of me. That I move than I fell, you know.
Sure, of course, it is something, it is an active episode, no.
aha, yes
You want them, if you want for example to teach them something to give them a lesson like that with humor, then it's very important that kids

Something like that remains more in their mind.
And i was going to be a teacher, I took a teachers' course in, in music for little children.

to teach them, to see if they have the ability to sing
um hu
then those we used many handkerchiefs, many eh sticks, to see if they know this a rhythm, you know, if they know you you you you, you you you
you know, if they can do that, you know so
um hu
But they didn't take me, because I couldn't sing, one had to know how to sing and play an instrument.
um hu
and I can't sing nor put up with the instrument.
cl
now I'm going to learn to take guitar
Of course, music is part of the culture, every culture has its own music.
yes yes, yes
And it's identified, with that mus- those people identify themselves each culture not with. with a certain music, for example the Hispanic culture the many the
um hu
they don't identify with salsa, merengue, not those busy dances, that music that there is.
um hu right, right
No and many people like that. um hu
um hu, okay wait, wait, Jeffi I'm talking this is business this is my baby, he wants the games charger

yes um hu
learn to write and spelling also,there is a song that you can write this word it teaches you to sing it so you can remember the word.
um hu
there are many things out there,with music all is music,because many children sometimes do not learn only talking. my baby learned a lot with music
he learned the the time tables with music i though him like that you know
um sure,yes because today.for example children when here in the abc in the alphabet
yeah
what that famous song
right yes,exactly
My three year old is also there, with his games, with a train game we bought him for his birthday few days ago
Yes, yes
So he is, with songs, the alphabet, He records it and so the song is being recorded
Do you know?, I recorded to my elder boy the songs I read in English
My brother records in Spanish
Mmm
So, one day he listened in spanish, the other day in English
Oh, that's good
He kept a diary, and he also had a book, we also bought the book in spanish, so he followed the story in spanish, it was good. My brother thinks we should make him read spanish, not only English
Because I read him a lot of stories, and sometimes I was tired , son I played a tape and he payed with it, listening to the story
So, that way, I didn't read the story 70000 times
Mmm
because when they are young you must read a lot
Yes, because kids are like an sponge, they learn everything
exactly, exactly
Everything is recorded in their minds, it's the best moment to teach them
Exactly
The best things, good manners
it's true, anyway, how minutes have we talk so far, I'm tired, I worked so hard, Oh my God
What?
And at work I am always singing also, let me tell you.
Of course, um hu.
I always do because, it is like the day goes by faster when I sing.  and, and I don't let people fight or have discussions to disturb me.
I am always singing, yes, they, they call me the singing office worker because I am even singing.
yes it is good there, to lift the spirit
I have to sing.  yes, yes, yes
well it depends I say also that music because there is some music I don't like that they call it now rap, that many young people use
o yes, yes, yes, they talk very badly
I don't like that music, it is terrible.
awful, they speak awful, I don't know, I don't know how mothers, I went to a party
yes to
and the gir I think was three years old and she was playing with that music, I took it and took it away
um hu
I said this is a children's party, and I brought music and I always bring my music how am I going to do it.  The clown, I am going to play this music and when I played my music children started this is old people's music, I don't want that
oh my God, they talk so much stupidity.
they wanted the, the, the music yes.  Yes and I told the mom, how can you play that music, that kid already saying - fu and
and all the bad words he was saying, I said how horrible.
Of course, they learn there, children speak all those things, there they speak of violence and all those things.
yes yes, yes, yes yes
An issue like that, very heavy, like that for children.
Yes.
Just because now, there are, not as many, as many children and they get into all of those problems, children begin to use weapons and this is a consequence of all the influence they have

Hello ?
Hello, good evening, Midre from Connecticut speaking
I think that I already spoke with you sir before. This is Annie from Miami
Oh, yes. We already talked
but
How are you doing ? Everything all right ?
yes, good. And you sir ?
Good, thanks, very good.
Eh, I don't remember what was the topic that was gave to us the last time.
I think that we discussed about matrimonials
This was, this was that you sir had
Aha
five kids, was it ?
Aha, aha, aha.
Yes
Yea
And is-
Today is the music
Yes
From what country are you ?
Then, good, I was born in Puerto Rico but we moved to the United States when I was five or six years old but my parents are Dominican.
Oh.
So do I, I feel that I am.
Dominican.
No, no, I feel Dominican and I don't feel Puerto Rican because I spent all my summers in Santo Domingo with my family but, my my eh, ay, I forgot, my godmother
Aha.
She took care of me, she was Puerto Rican, so, you know, I have both.
Oh. Yes, but you don't speak Dominican, you speak more
No. But, you know, it depends, it depends on how I say it.
Mhm.
And you?
I, well, eh, no, I'm Puerto Rican and I like salsa music.
Mhm.
I like to dance.
Mhm.
And I encounter music from many countries, at least in Puerto Rico there's many great eh, composers writers and we have artists like
Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony
Mhm.
Gilberto Santa Rosa is known in many countries.
Yes.
Oh, i think that the music, i love it, i put it when I'm at my house, i dance, i clean faster, it cheers me up, it takes depression of me.
when I'm feeling sad.
Uh um.
Or when I'm nostalgic about my country
Yes
Because i listen to the songs that my mom sang, that she heard.
Uh um.
And you, ¿do you like music?
I like it, i always listen to christian music.
Oh.
Uh, but also, you know, since i have a little girl, I'm trying to, to teach her, oh, come on, teach her different kinds of music, so i always have her listening to
uh, classic music or Latin music for children
Uh um.
Uh, or, or in english, uh, you know, the music, with, teaching her the colors or the alphabet, or stuff like that. And right now, at this point in my life, I'm more
like, you know, with children's music
Right
That, let's say, the music that i like the most
So, ¿how old is your girl?
well, she's, she's twenty months old.
Oh, ok, it's, that's a good time for music.
yes, and
It is said that kids who, who one are raised with music, from the womb they stay calm and learn, and are more intelligent.
i don't know if that's true, but
I don't know, this night we went shopping and she was in the car eh, singing, that song about the alphabet.
right.
you know, and my husbands looks up to me and says, but not her you know, a little younger for that, I said to him, I don't know but she is singing it.
yes, right, as long as the kids, mie-, the girls, best period
you know
i think they grasp is from, from the day they are born to
yes
four or five years somewhere.
yes
well, then they forget a lot of things.
well, me, everything
yes.
I have always forgotten a lot of things too, that is why you know, the music to us is something very very very, eh, eh
you know, important, we don't watch TV that much.
Ah.
so everything she learns, lets say, the animals, whatever, is because of music, and the books we read.
oh, yes, right, eh, the mentally challenged kids also learn a lot with music.
yes.
because my son had a partner that eh had a baby boy that with Down's Syndrome and
Aha.
ya she played music for him and he used to learn all the dances and everything very quickly.
Mhm, mhm.
The fastest he learned.
yes.
And he learned the songs by heart.
yes, tha, that's the way with her, eh, many times she starts eh I don't remember who is the one that sings it, but we have a record that she's call-, the song in called
my aunt, or aunt Monica or something like that
Aha.
and she likes to dance and when people see her dance they say ulala, ulala, you know
Aha.
whatever, and today, probably about two or three weeks ago that you can't hear that song, and she was all day long ulala, ulala and I was thinking, OK, she's now remembering that song
you know, but I like it because, you see, she moves her feet, her knees, the he-, you know, so
Aha, aha.
we also can make movements and she can learn the parts of, aha
yes, she, she exercises, mhm.
the parts of, of the body, so you know, al-, everything even though
yes, it helps her to learn, to, to know the body and at the same time it relaxes her too, because music is good.
And the language too. What we are doing is that, you know, when my husband is not home, I speak to him only in Spanish
so, when he gets here, well, about a ninety percent of the time, we speak in English and sometimes, you know, I keep on speaking in Spanish cause I'm used to that, but
Aha. Aha.
that way she can pick up both languages, that's why I do it and also I play music to her, so that she listen to music in English and Spanish.
I like that, I go to a lot of salsa concerts, concerts of
Aha.
meringue music, no, I don't go to many of them. Well, I like, I mostly like folk music, music from the, the
what's the name? like from the country
The plena and stuff like that.
the Plena, the bomb, all that and then after the
Mhm.
they do shows in New York of Bomba and Plena and we go to those
Mhm.
And we go to Olga Tañon concerts
Mhm.
So, they have lots of nice music, this guy that plays salsa, this, oh my God, what's his name? Victor Manuel
Mhm.
I never miss one of their concerts, we always go to those
Well
they do a lot of concerts here and we always go to those
Mhm. And us to me, I like Merengue music instead
Aha.
instead of Salsa music
yes, because yes, if your family is
but
Dominican, I imagine that you like to dance Dominican music.
Eh, well, it's pretty much the same because my parents lived in Puerto Rico, for about twenty years before moving to the United States, so
Oh, yes?
you know, it's not like we were a typical family
Aha.
because they lived in Santo Doming, and then because of the revolution, they had to
Aha, they left.
they left for Puerto Rico and from Puerto Rico, they moved to Miami.
Oh, and now they are here.
So, you know, they spent a lot of time in Puerto Rico and that's why sometimes, I, I don't know which country I'm from, because it's like I'm
a mix , you know of the two of them.
It's like a kid from, a kid from my girl's group, he was asked, which country are you from? And he said, I'm mixed. They asked him why and he said that because his father was from
this country and my mom is from this other country, so his is mixed race and he said he didn't know what he was.
yes, that's right, that's how I feel because sometimes I don't feel, I don't feel comfortable you know, I don't feel Puerto Rican
and I don't feel Dominican, it depends on
Right, right.
So, but, you know, i, i enjoy both cultures, and it's not so different, but they have some, uh,
Words that, that
I have showed all the typical music from my country to my daughters.
Um
I have showed them the dances, i have showed them the music and they, they don't listen to so much, but they can dance it
Yeah
So, i was a member here of the group of the Puerto Rican stop
Um
And, and we did presentations and dances, i was in charge of teaching the girls to dance bomba, to dance plena
Um, that's good
To dance salsa
Um
So, the, the, my children know how to dance all that because the, they all like music very much.
I
They all love the music.
I also, what i, salsa, you know, it's alright, or whatever, but i think that of all music, i like the typical the most
Yes, the typical music is more beautiful, much more beautiful.
Yeah, you know, and like, no, yeah, no, i don't know, i like it more and i like to watch the dance more than when people dances salsa or whatever
I, i also like Peruvians music, which i find gorgeous
Mmh.
Chinese and Indian music, well I like also the, their music, it is beautiful I don't understand what is says but
yes, but the sound it has, you know, like, it relaxes you
yes.
and, now when I went to Puerto Rico I bought a disc of those that bring the music of the water
Aha.
of the, of the trees, of the
Mmh.  How great.
Ah, when you want to relax, when you are very tense, well you play this little music and you hear well, very pretty.
Mmh.
It sounds very pretty.
yes, that is good.  That also that, no, we do many things, that when, you know like right now it does, before of, before this call, we had gotten back from, from shopping
not even five minutes and normally what we do  is that eh, we turn on the radio and we place one you know, like a song that the music is kind of
Aha.
nothing else, just music, it doesn't have any lyrics.
yes, aha, yes, no message or anything.
And that aha, and that also, help at least it helps me to be able, you know, to relax or whatever.
And that you get here and you have to put away and get the shopping out and come up with the shopping and
yes.
that is why I say that music is very important for, well at least for me.
Hmm.
because I was raised with my whole family always with music
Hmm.
My children my daughter i-, is seventeen years old, so she is with that reggaeton thing and the and the hip hop and all of that music
Aha
My kids are already big, and listen to American music.
yeah
and
yeah
and me for example, I cant really stand the rock and roll the kids listen too, I cant really tolerate it for a long time.
yeah
They make me very nervous, they make me hyper.
yeah
I don't really like rock and roll, I listen to it, and i have a few friends that have a band.
mhm.
And they sometimes invite me to watch them play, i go and stay  for a little while, but then i say oh no, i gotta go, cause my head starts to hurt.
the, um, those sounds get in your ears.
I don't really care about that kind off music, What i hate is what they say.
oh yeah, like regueton.
yeah, that, i like that kind of music, just not what they say, that's why
I think that, the music we used to listen too before is different, like the composers used to dedicate themselves to writing love songs and romantic songs.
mhm.
Like the music had a more value, the music would send you a message.
yeah
Hello?
Hi, um, what's your name?
My name is Mercedes, and, and you?
Pilar
Ah, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, where are you calling from?
Mm, I live in But I'm Honduran. Of origin.
And where do you say, where do you say that you live?
In
In oh, I don't know that
Mm It's West of the city of Philadelphia,
Ah, huh
past  the next town is
Hm mm
and you?
I am from Spain, and I live, I live in New York.
Ah No, I thought that they were speaking to um, it was only people in the Philadelphia area.
No, no, it's, for me, for what I can see, it's all Euro- from all the United States, Y have already spoken with people from well we should, we should talk about cell phones, no
Ah yes yes yes yes yes
What do you think about cell phones? do you have one?
Yea I've got a cell phone really it's like almost like I don't have it, because n- I hardly use it and I don't get many calls,
yes, if I use it it's uh, pretty great, but it's pretty rare that I use it, and you?
I don't have it right now. What I was in Europe, I had a phone,
Hm mm
but, here I don't have one because it's really expensive
yea
And I don't have, I don't have much money because I'm a student
Hm mm
And I decided not to have a mobile phone, but uh, that's not the only reason, I've also never really like mobile phones very much. I'm not sure that they're healthy.
yea ah, for, for, why
Because of the radiation they emit, hasn't, hasn't there been some study?
hm mm
Showing that really they're not bad for your health.
Hm mm
And I don't want to use a phone all my life and when twenty years have gone by, they discover it's bad for your health
Hm, yea
and we all get brain cancer, or something like that.
Like almost everything, you start to use technology, let's say now with the cell phone, they're doing the same thing really, that maybe yea, yes
Right and you don't know until later if it was good or not.
yes
Yeah, that's too bad, but
Yeah but, let's say it's your turn to drive, what would you think, for example, of the people who drive and use r cell phone at the same time
yes, and besides, that's also more dangerous
And that's just terrible, I agree with you on that
That's really dangerous, there are a lot of accidents, but fewer now because people are using headphones or hands-free devices, or whatever they're called
uh huh, hmmm
But a lot of people continue without using those devices. And when you have only one hand, I don't know how they can drive well.
For some people - I think that for me, it doesn't bother me, but it's the people who don't have respect for others in how they use their cell phones.
Hmmm..
Right, or maybe that they don't have the kind of manners when they're using their...
Yes, because it's also true sometimes in the, the...
Their cell phone.
On a bus, in a bus people talk on their cell phones really loudly.
Uh huh.
And that's bad manners, right
Exactly
Because you don't have to talk that loudly, you can talk more quietly, right?
And even more than that, I think that for me, more than anything else, it's that people don't show respect for where they're calling, the telephone, people who drive, but
Well, it's all about convenience, so, that's it, phones - cell phones - are a technology that facilitates communication is so, so
situations, for example, right now with the hurricane, it was the only way for a lot of people to communciate with their families
yes yes, okay with, but, I believe they used the satellite telephones. The, the mobiles did not work well, because the but sometimes they did work, and yes.
yes, that it is true, because we have a friend that was in New Orleans, and we tried to call him to the cellphone, and yes, it, was like it dropped
the network
yes, sometimes, it works, and sometimes does not.
and it did not work. Hm mm
But well, it is, it is true that the advantages I see in it, are that always it is reachable,
Hm mm
if the battery did not die if, for anything somebody need you or need to speak with you,
Hm mm
always you are reachable, and that it is very good.
Hm mm, hm mm.
And, and then so eh, also, in some emergency,
Hm mm
You can call, if you stayed on the road with the car stopped, and, o whatever, anything happen to you, you can call and ask
ask for help, and that it is really good. That's because when I have more money and can afford it, I'll buy a cellphone. But what I'll do is use it with the headphone.
that is, and what, but let' also say, have the ones of cards. Really, there are some of card, that you only buy the card and use what you have in it.
are those here in, in the United States also?
Mm, I can, I know that they are selling by Walmart
Oh, so I will know about it because, eh,
with, yes, yes yes, because, they say that they have not them, because, a problem is you have get a contract really, and the contract never is less than one or two years.
Sure
And I understand that with this, you won't have to sign a contract and you have a card and you buy what you are going to use and
Sure, because also, the other, the agreement, you have to pay every month.
Hm mm
and most of the times the plans already include the calls so they are more expensive.
yes
In Europe, I used to have a plan where one would pay a basic service and then the calls you would have to pay them separately but if you didn't make so many calls
it was a lot cheaper.
Sure, eh, yes, and let's say, that's the problem I have, we have now. The plan that I have now, as I say, I have the phone but I rarely use it.
Sure
And that's why, at least we have one in which the minutes are summed up. But, if we sum many of them we are not going to be able to use them all.
Hm
There's no way that, that we are going to be able to use them.
Sure,
But, oh well, that's that and they are summing them up. Let's say, in Europe they use cellphones a lot. It's pretty much the same as in the United States or
Hm, I think that that happened in Europe first
Hm mm
the cellphones, there are countries, I've lived in Austria and there, the, around an eighty percent of people would have one.
So, just a few didn't own a cellphone, and those were the little kids or the older people that are not into that things or don't want to use them.
Hm mm
Everyone in the world has a cell. And well, I have been here in the United States for some time. After I left and came back after three or four years...
nobody used a cell. No one even had a cell.
Mmm hmmm
And in Europe not everybody had a cell. Now I have returned and  here all the world has a cell or rather those that have come here. I believe that now they are more or less the same.
And those are the same problems that are here. People don't know where to appropriately use a cell phone.
Yes. Yes, yes the people who talk loud in the subway and bus more than others.  This is bad manners, but there are even people talking as they walk down the street with...
...with a handset instead of a telephone in their ears. They carry a telephone in their pocket and a very small handset that can't be seen and they go on talking and then it looks like they are just talking to themselves.
That has happened to me. I thought he was talking to me or... or to who?
Yes and you stand there thinking this is crazy. What is happening?
Mmm Hmm
But now its here. I've become accustomed to it. Now if I see someone talking to themselves on the street I think that he has a mobile phone. Well, the other difference is that there in Europe people use a lot of text messages. And I don't think anyone here uses them.
There are short text messages.
Mmm hmmm
You can write them with your cell and it comes out very cheaply. Only about 25 cents to send a message. But its cheap in Europe.
Here, obviously, the calls are cheaper, but I don't know. But over there a call would cost you, uh... around the same 25 cents per minute.
Mmm hmm
And the minimum is a minute. But text messages cost 25 cents per message. When you talk you are almost always talking for more than a minute.
I believe, truly I believe that. I don't think that is as common here.
So...
In my country, yes, let's say it is a little more common, but I believe that it's the same economically for the people. That's how we say it, well I do.
sure
ther's not as much money at my country as here is it. here people, here 25 cents, what are them
that doesn't matter, of course
exactly
but there, well there it was popular, especially among students, overall.
hmm hmm
because those are the ones who write faster, because with, writing with a phone, it's complicated, because the only has nine buttons, all the characters are there
hmm hmm, hmm hmm, i couldn't do it
but, the, the students turned it into some sort of, of of game, of skill, and they even did tournaments of who could write something faster,
and they saved a lot of money sending messages instead of instad of instead of, calling, they even had tactics some sort of language.
hmmm.
and sure, if you call, and hang up, without taking the call,
hmm hmm
whoever has called gets written.
OK
then the, the young people use that for calling, for saying, for giving signals, say, when they call you, they call it a missed, they call it doing a missed
aha
when i do a missed, they call the missed. come down, I'm waiting for you down there, or sometimes just for show- for that i remember you, then
call and hang up, and then, i remember you. instead of sending an email, or simply, that's a message of
hmm
I remember you, so that means that the people from Europe have a lot of imagination to save money if
Imagination. a lot yes, oh.
a lot of cre- a lot of creativity
A lot of creativity, that's the word, yes. No, me, well as I say, I would have to practice a lot to become a little but no, and, as I say, since I rarely use it
Yes, but
and the truth, the only and what, the truth is that I have it, but mainly just for emergencies, and yes
someday the car's tire will deflate
of course, yes
mainly me, the truth is, uh huh
but that is very good
no
Eh, but if you use it more, look at combinations for you to use with the auri- with the earphone, earplug whatever it's name
yes yes yes
the earpiece, but it goes far, so that you don't get any radiation.
yes, yes
just in case
I'm going to have to, let's see if buying one of those, because it's dangerous right. and say- say ah, the one, the only one i talk of my fam- family, is my husband, and every time
that
where he's driving, if he's driving he hangs up. i don't want you to talk with the phone and drive
sure, sure
i mean it's like never, the truth, few, ve- very few times
and have you heard about the phones of, of the next generation, that are, that are already arriving?
it's, are those the ones who have um, the, your credit card and all that inside them, your data?
oh, no, i
no
yes, i guess that too, but i mean those you can even see the TV on them
oh
you can you can look the internet, you can look your email, they have everything already. it's like a mini computer, with internet connection, that's supposed to arrive eventually, they've been working on it for a long time, but it never comes
aham aham
it is on Europe already, on some places it is. in austria there was already, it arrived last year.
ah
i didn't see it, i never i never used it because it was, it was more expensive, of course. but that, that would be great
i was told by someone who had been to nor- to Norway he told me that what they had is that bu- ba- basically with the cell phone they could do anything. buying, huh, food from a vending machine
hm
paying, huh, the parking meter, like that, because it had the information of his credit card
oh of course, and it communicated with, with the with the machine
Hello
hello, hello, My name is Auria
What's your, what's your name?
Auria
Auria, hi I'm Nicole
Nicole, nice to meet you
nice to meet you, How are you?
fine, fine and you?
fine, Where are you?
I'm a little bit north of Atlanta
oh okay and how's the weather over there?
oh, warm, but very nice, and where are you from?
eh, I'm from New York
ha from New York
yes, I'm here in the city now
has it started being cold or not yet
no, not cold, it's hot, up to now it's been super humid, but today is the first day that it hasn't been so humid.
and when more or less is that autumn starts there and the cold weather arrives?
eh, like in October autumn begins, in other words it feel more like autumn here, but the cold
okay
the serious cold starts like in December, January in other words in January the snow starts and from then on the cold continues until April so
oh, okay
there's still a little time left til then
is more or less like that, but with the exception that here, it hardly ever snows, but the cold weather comes like in January and last until mid March
mm
then Spring starts and that last, last like three four weeks and then the heat
of course, of course, same here, in other words the spring is like super short, sometimes you don't even notice the spring
exactly
cold and then hot
yes well
listen, and where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico
from Puerto Rico
yes, and you?
I, I was born here in New York, but my family is Cuban and, I also lived in Chile for a short time so my Spanish is like a mix of things
oh, okay well I was born here also, I was born in North Carolina, I was raised there and moved to Puerto Rico when I was twelve years old
mm
and that's when I learned Spanish
okay
I mean, to speak Spanish, because I understood it because my parents would speak to me in Spanish, but I would always answer them back in English.
sure, the same with me, I my, my parents always talked to me in English, but my grandparents, I was raised by my grandparents too because we all lived together and my grandparents
always talked to me in Spanish and I would always answer in English and until, I mean, I started truly speaking at around frouteen years old
well me, exactly I more or less at fourteen as well because when I was twelve I moved over there but I almost had thirteen years old
and I refused, I did not, I did not want to have anything to do with Spanish, I did not want to have anything to do with Puerto Rico, y was very rebellious that they took me away from my
you know, my school, from my friends
of course, of course, at that age one feels
of course, you know, after one year of not having any friends because nobody spoke Spanish, well I changedd my mind
and where did you live before of, of going to Puerto Rico?
North Carolina
Where? in North Carolina, I see, I see
yes
ehm, well, and the topic, the topic I listened was about cell phones I don't know if, to I see, because sometimes they are two different topics, I have had conversations where the other person hears another things
exactly
but, I don't know what you think about cell phones if they are bothersome
well, it just depends on the good manners of the person that uses it
uhm
it is my opinion, I don't think there should be laws that tell you how are you supposed to use it or not
hmm
simply I think that a person should have the good manners to know that if they are at the cinema they should not use it, if they are in a restaurant, they should not use it
yes sure
or at lease excuse yourself and go outside.
of course, of course, obvious, obvious, the problem is that there are people that do not have that courtesy.
exactly
I have been in movie theaters where the phone rings at the restaurant,  where people have, or rather, there are two people in the restaurant and one is on the phone
or rather, if is a urgent thing, obviously, but I do not understand what urgency
yes.
it can't be that, that urgent.
but, if you mean urgent, you mean with the permission
of course
I get back in five minutes, you know, go outside, you take the call and, and
of course
and yeah, but people like you say, it not courteous
um, yes
the only law that I believe should exist is when driving
uhm
because I have seen in front of me many accidents happen because the person in front of me was on the phone
um
they are in the highway and for speaking on the phone, they missed their stop, their exit, their exit,
um
and so then, and they do what I tell  you, a turn, to reach their exit, and I have seen accident that happen that way because of that
um, yes yes yes, yes I agree, absolutely, that is driving
at least have the ear bud or earpiece as they say
of course, but have your hands free, because one really needs free hands when one is driving, I see people
if you're going to be in the car
going down the street, not paying much attention because you're talking on the phone, imagine while you're driving it's much worse, that one should have the hands, at least
to drive and the other thing in the hospitals, that one shouldn't really use the phones in the hospitals because the signals can interfere withe the machines in the hospital
yes
one should turn off the phone in the other places, that is, that is a matter of being considerate to other people
exactly
and, and also being being polite to other people that are with you, because you are with friends and family and you answer the phone in the middle of a conversation, it should be for something important, it shouldn't be
that you're with a friend, speaking with another friend on the phone, you see?
oh, because that's dismissing the moment that you're with that person
sure sure, and the, the phone is something that it's supposed to improve communication
exactly
but I think that it worsens communication if one is always being interrupted by calls
I, I am- I agree with you, because I think that much technology even if it advances, communication as you say at the same time, we as a society have the habit
of getting out of the moment
sure, sure
you know, with television, with videos, and what do I know, with music
with computers
well you one doesn't live in this same moment and the telephone sometimes well it distracts you from the moment also, and I sometimes refuse to answer the phone.
if I am playing with my youngest daughter, she is four years old, she is only going to be four for another year
um
you know, and I will never be able to go back to that moment
of course
while the person who is calling me, well I can talk to them, you know
but, I don't answer, I mean if I am with another person, unless it is something important, or if I know that it is going to be a short call to agree on something, but if I am with someone I really don't, don't answer the phone.
well, I live alone so I have time when I'm by myself, to talk on the phone, alone
exactly
and I, I believe that when I am with other people, I should be with that person I mean like it used to be when there weren't cell phones to talk on the phone at home and not in the street
exactly
I mean I don't know, it is a little, it is like an obsession that people always have to be available
exactly and one doesn't
I mean also via e-mail I mean people have those blackberries and they are always ready by e-mail to answer the e-mail and I don't understand what can be so urgent on e-mail
that cannot be answered later when you are at home in front of the computer
yes it is true but it is that people, as you say, it is like an obsession or something, they always have to answer the phone when it rings
um
and it is one thing, even though they don't talk even a minute, but they have to answer the phone the moment it rings
um ha
but I don't, I don't answer it when I am in a given moment what do I know that I can take the time to talk to the person, but if I
I`m making something, cooking or reading one book to the girl, so you know I let it dream.
um um
and after I will call it back, look mommy sorry, or look someone, sorry.
off ourse, off course, that makes sense, also with the cellphones one can see who is calling, like this, like this is don't know, I mean, if I`m going to see my girlfriend tomorrow.
And the girlfriend is calling me, well I answer because I know that we have to take a decision tomorrow.
exactly
But if it is another person, I will call in other time, I mean I don't know, I mean I believe that it is one thing to have a little of common sense, but the people thinks that always. the other is that the youngsters,I`m a teacher,the younsters.
They like the cellphones theyalways,cellphone rings in the class, I mean, I don't know how many times the cellphone rings in my class.
Yes I know.
And I say, you are in the school not to answer the telephone, to learn.
exactly
Also that they are here with all their friends, I don't know who is calling, I mean one imagine they are from high school but one imagine that  the majority of the...
youngsters in high school their friends,also are in the same school.
Is suppose that yes.
I mean because, those cellphones are calling, are the fathers calling them, I don't believe.
no, exactly but, aha mommy, my mommy is teacher also and she pass by much.
um And what she teaches? your mommy, at
She teaches Spanish at high school also.
over there, there, I teach English for inmigrants.
at,ESL
-ESL o yes that
OK but the, my daughter well she had bad luck with me, because she is going to say that I am like old fashion or what do I now because she is not going to have a cell phone
at age twelve or thirteen she is not going to go everywhere with a cell phone
no, twelve or thirteen no, it is that my students many already are seventeen, eighteen, they are rather grown
o yes but I, I have seen that she is twelve, thirteen, you know, they are going into seventh, eighth grade and they look like they are
already grown, because they place lots of pressure on parents and well parents give in
um um
and I don't believe in that
yes, yes
I when she is seventeen years old well I buy a phone and OK
yes
and this to call- to call me
and you only have that daughter?
yes only, I am a single mom
OK
and well, she is the only one I have so far
but well, she is taking good care of her
yes same as the playstations and that, I tell her no, no, no
Hello!  My name is Glorisa
Good evening, How are you?,  I am Norma from here in Atlanta,
Oh!, Fine And you?
We find each other again Right?
aha, hey last night I spoke with another lady lady that dreamed like you, but she was from Phiadelphia.
aha
Her name was Silvia  And we talked about the same, we talked about the cell phone.
Oh, yes
yes
hmm
And do you remember the cell phone?
What do you say?
We need to talk about the cell phone.
yes, yes
About the cell phones.
aha
And do you like it?
Well,
do you agree with people that go driving and talking?
oh, well no, I do not agree that they are driving and talking it is very dangerous, I don't know can distract, bring, or some bad news they can get
I know that they are in shock, and there are going to be accidents because of that No?
aha
No, but I mean, on the other side The cellulars have now become more necessary. No, for any emergency, for anything that happens, in many cases you can't find the telephone
nearby well at least you have your cellular.
aha, aha
And you what do you think?
I don't like it, I don't drive and talk, I absolutely scream at the people that drive and talk on the phone, I go nuts
aha
because they don't pay attention they are on the phone and are not paying attention if they took the light or not, or
aha
or, or is arguing. Once I was with my friend and her husband was arguing with her and I said: hang up, Hang up that you are going to kill me by arguing with him.
aha
And sometimes now the kids are using them in school. We have to take them away. Is a nuisance the cellulars in the school; They lose them, we have to look for them
we have to mark them, they go crazy, as if it was the last bill in the pocket, Oh, and sometimes they don't respect, don't respect the teachers
The teachers tell them to turn them off, they don't turn them off they leave them on vibrator. Is a problem, a really bad problem, specially in school
All those kids, and they lose them, they get lost We collect like, like twenty or twenty-five cellulars, even though we tell them not to bring them to school
They still bring them,
Of course,
They still bring them,
Of course, that shouldn't, shouldn't be, I mean I agree when is some emergency no?
Exactly
There is no but when is something, for example in the school why kids need cell phones
Exactly
No, they go to study, not to talk with their friends, they go to study
aha
No, and, and when one is handling, it's really dangerous that one is you know, eh is handling and talking on the phone
Exactly
yes, is goo because as it's said, they don't pay attention. No, but in part is like, sometimes is convenient, no? is has its adantages and disadvantages
yes, of course, but if, if you know what I told a mother one day. You Know, you should not send it with the cell phone
Ah, but that's the way I contact him, and I told her look, he can use here the phone in the office, any tiem he wants
yes, it's an emergency. You call here and we'll look for him
Right
She told me. Not but, you think you are, that, that I bought him the cell phone so he keeps it on top of the table, that if is, I said, Look
then I'll tell the principal to start taking them away, take it awaya first because if, if one of the, of the laws of the school, is not to bring
is not to bring a cell phone, he is not. You are sending him with the cell phone, you are guilty. Because he gets punished. And they are not punished yet, they should be punished
well bad, so the don't do it again
Of course, the parents are also the ones that really, as they say education starts at home, no?
eh, yes, yes, yes
The kids and the parents don't sducate, they don't used the kids to the good things, good manners
aha
O doing really right things
yes
kids won't learn, they will not learn, understand
Exactly, yeah
Mmm
This let me see that, I'm so tired, i ran to parties this weekend and I'm really tired, and let me, this is a
I will tell you that yesterday I trowed a party
Mmm
And she called asking me to arrive later, and well, i wasn't finding the place, she kept calling like 15
times in less than 3 minutes
Oh my God
And i left the phone ringing, I said: I would not let this lady cause me and accident
yes
only to get to her party fast. And i was really close from her home. She told me to go to the other side
Oh yeas
And after that I was two blocks away from here. She told me: no, it's somewhere else. Other time I will not listen to her
and I will follow the address I have online
yes
I get there really easy. Next time I would not even call her. She was driving me crazy with the damn cellphone
yes, people now
Oh my God.
They are very addicted to their cell phones.
Yes, yes, yes
Ah, if nothing is happening, they grab their cell phone to look at or find someone to talk to.
Yes, yes, it's true, it's true. My husband always tells me, "I'm not going to buy a new phone because you always leave it here."
You believe that you owe it to be as important a load as your wallet, and I say, I'm not going to carry it as my wallet because
My baby is the most important thing to me and he's in school, and if something happens there, call me.
Clearly
And if something happens to you, the ambulance calls me, so I have to have a phone if that happens. We saw an accident once on the highway.
Then you know it will come
Clearly, certainly for emergencies, right?
Yes, yes, yes
Really, you don't need one often, there aren't many things one needs. For example, before I had a cell phone,
A few years ago there were no cell phones, no internet, or anything.
I know right,
You were living well then and you didn't lack anything, but something was missing
Exactly
We live in a consumerist society, and if it's not that, then why
yes
all the advertisement and propaganda, I don't know.
Aha
They trick into thinking that you need something that you don't, we don't need them.
yes yes, exactly, and how they do it, the Ipo is another thing
mhm
Everyone seem to have that music, into their ears and all that, oh my God !, and in the cinema, there too, he told that we had to talk about
if they use it in the cinema; they put that in cinemas and manage to ruin your movie when you go there
Yeah, i don't even go there and say, I'm through hearing all the people talk on their mobiles, in the cinema, they do it in trains too, as if it were
their home
Ah, yes the train too
You can hear, like all of their conversation, the one you have closer and the one in front of you
I don't like that, either my mobile phone, i leave it vibrating and if the one that calls me can way until
i go off the train, I'm not very manic, my friends say: Hey, Gloria, what you have, i say: look at the road
You go at fifty and talking and i don't think that you can see the road and talk at the same time. I find rather strange because when i
I don't get on the highway but whenever i go my mind has to be on the road not talking to someone
to the phone, Oh! I'm getting crazy with those phones, they drive me mad
Right, nowadays everyone has a mobile. Everyone walks with his
I know
talking to their mobile, talking, from here to there
I know I know, i didn't let my little to have have one in school, has it for emergencies only.
No
So then he tells me: Mom but if an emergency happens, I'll tell you. Then I tell him: You go and since I work, in the school they let you call me.
They know that you are my son.
mh
They let you call me. You know, but we restrict the telephone to everyone so that the cellphones don't come and still
They don't care, and you tell them to not use them and they are in the hallway they go into the bathroom.
Oh, yes.
In the hallway they go behind the door, oh these kids are horrible, horrible. Oh! My God Horrible. Even in church there is a poor woman
Of course, it's a boy, uh huh
Her cell phone rang as if it was a bell. And even when the priest was praying, he stopped and said, "What's that, a door?"
And he made it into a joke.
Oh, for sure.
But he made it like a joke, so then he said when one goes to church, it is to pray, not to ask the ringing phone.
So, she felt very bad and went outside. Afterwards, when she went outside and the phone rang again, and everyone began to laugh.
Because this woman was already, I said ugh, that she is interrupting the concentration that you have in church. Yo know, so
Of course yes, when we go to temple, our temple, there is also
Ha
No, over there, people have their phones and before beginning the conference, the devout tells them please turn off your phones so that they don't interrupt.
Ah and the people still don't turn them off right?
Yes, some turn them off. No? But some there still don't
Some will pay.
Have and sometimes rings no?
I know what a lack of respect right?
ah, yes really
like the don't listen to the adults, that is the reason why the kids won't listen either.
mm
Because they follow their mother and father examples.  You know. I am so tired, now i am, I am helping my baby with his homework.
Ah, OK
we are writting, breakfast too he has to write eight sentences of celular. Because he has cellular and can leave without celular and can use in the theater
can you it when he goes dancing, that this, that can be used with games. Now i use the cellular like a calculator
ah, yes
because can i use as a calculator.
Ah, that could be true
yes the only bad thing is that if I can not find the celilar I don't remember. Really, i put a reminder, to let me know that
i had an appoitment.  In the reason is good, yes
yes, in some things.  No, that is good No?
I got him ja
but it can be adictive to much
I know
yes reallly,
anyway continue talking that I am tired. Oh my God, you had call to much? Had they were to many calls?  Had you call or they also call you?
Well every day Well they call me, I haven't made calls.
Oh, because you You can make them too, You know ?
yes, me too, I know but I don't, I
ha
I don't call, they call me everyday, because there is a cretain amount of call one does.
exactly.
i cant only do twenty five calls, that's it
So you cant or cant be the twenty five, everyone keeps calling, you don't call?
I guess, i don't know, oh because for me yeah
oh
they always call me, everyday since i started studying.
oh they call you everyday, I'm glad.
yes, they call me everyday.
oh I'm glad, im glad.
and one day, i got two calls.
oh me too.
well yesterday, no yesterday, on Friday i lost a call because when they called i wasn't there.
ha
here, then i didn't get anymore calls.
so I've lost a few amount of calls, because i told them i was only here for a few days, and sometimes i am, sometimes i am not.
mhm
and the machine, they leave a message on the machine, and i sometimes forget to pick up the call, so they call again.
because i tell them that I'm here during the evening, so they call late sometimes,
hello, Whom am I speaking to?
Hello, good evening, I'm Lorena
Lorena nice to meet you you're speaking to Lina
Paulina hi how are you?
fine, listen I didn't hear what the topic was about

pressing the button and he told me here take it is your turn and I didn't hear anything
no no but it wasn't clear if I was attending
yes, he has an accent, a very heavy accent
and I really didn't hear anything and it was very difficult, hard
yes
I was making all the points before getting the call but the last thing I understood was that the advantages, something like that like which ones have been
aha
the most important dates in your life I understand and which ones have been the least important and then he said something about the internet that in your opinion
aha
which are the advantages and disadvantages
and disadvantages of using the internet
of using the internet and at the end said to give your opinion and talk about that and maybe we can get to know people by this medium we are in right now.

Because in this life, with all the rush and all the hurry and with so many activities well sometimes, I don't even telephone my friends to say hi or to see how they are doing. Right?
There is no time yes
Well then one has to value that it it is important.
and also one can get to know the people as well
yes yes yes yes yes
A little bit more
But one dedicates some minutes to washing dishes for example to like to call on the phone like this one is, its important
Yes, take advantage of the time, right?
yeah yeah
Now that the kids are in bed.
yes
Good, they have to put one another to sleep as this is going on over there
yeah,
yes is important
yes and, and this of internet well, this is another of the questions, well it is a marvelous thing.
Do you use it a lot?
eh, me not so much but my children and especially the youngest one is always attached
yes
and the most important thing is that the computers they are a marvelous thing, right?
yes but,
they facilitate the access to the information.
to the information
I have tried the encyclopedia of, of paper well, it has become a decoration article
yes is good to always have it at hand but
yes, yes,yes they are beautiful
yes, the the internet it can be very useful and also it could be very bad because, like you said, the information that is good but also information that is bad, right?
bad information, right? everything that is knows also of
oh, of pornography and everything is, es of everything like that
exactly what a terrible thing, right? yes, yes, yes,
yes, that's why you must be wise
yes
but is incredible to communicate with someone or to  learn about something.
Yes or someone in Chile who you can send an e-mail or something like that. right?
yes
those parents too
And like you said, one can have access to many things with the encyclopedia
yes yes yes come in and go directly into the kitchen, there you'll find some medicine and even a natural remedy
yes
even microbiology, physics, or whatever, right?
it's true and above all now that I am over here I never used to cook much when I was younger
yes. aja
and today that's how I get out the the many cost of everything  and and I get straight numbers
Ah, exactly and I came out happy, right? and and I remember that
Yes
yes the other day for the pumpkin pie, right? during Halloween
yes
No man there must have been like thirty-five different recipes
yes
Well then to choose one and prepare it
and to prepare them and to prepare them
yes, and how is he?
and the other one who said how it was like to meet someone via telephone or the internet
we didn't find out over this medium, the phone calls and everything
oh and if we're going to talk about that, no ?
aha so i truly liked that and it resulted newfangled, it's incredible
yes
then those ones are trying again to stick us that the phone is useful and important, no ?
yes
talking to people
how did you know about this project ?
my daughter in the University of Pennsylvania
oh shes is from that university, no ?
yes, you too
eh no my husband co- he took part in a project they had the year
aha
then this year they sent an him an e-mail telling that they were doing this project
ah okay
and if ah if your native language is Spanish you can join so he sent it to me too and told that like he was north-american and told me that he talk real well
but he wasn't a native so you go, you join
that was nice, listen talking about that
and i sent it to him, ah
the other day i had to talk with a gentleman that lives in New York but his parents are Puerto Rican
now
its hard to understand it and you i am not going to have some problem like we have to speaking i say is they eat the letters and change the words and
very fast
and they talk very fast that work tell me the same mister that start the call no?
there is but he has it
not so a flat yes
yes i spoke with them i gave it my comment i told them that at least
someone talk good Spanish
write yes its true he is reading at least because they say something when it finish the time
yes
he said time is up
yes
time is up and I say, no, how can you say that
no, yes, yes, yes, or for example when it says wait in the line
yes
how does it say, I forgot, now, hold on
I don't know, it mixes both up and you can't understand anything
yes yes yes
no, I complained already, I told them no, you have to read it again
it's good you said that, I haven't told them, I never thought about that
and change the, oh, no, I, I told them and the, the one in charge of the project called me at home and asked is it really that bad?
he said they're finding someone who speaks Spanish to try and make the recording
no, yes, yes
yes, because I can't understand it, I once had to listen to it twice
sure
because I didn't understand what it was saying about going and who knows what
yes, me neither, and finally I unders- I don't understand that word
I push any number because no
I, I push the four, because I understand it's a, no, a phone without wires, wireless
yeah
I hope that's it, anyway I already passed the test, test accomplished, and they patch me through, and then, hey, do you have a lot of family in Chile, all your relatives
Hello.
Good evening, my name is, and I live in Connecticut.
This is Annie, of Miami, we have spoken before.
Oh, Miami, ah, and how are you?
Good, and you?
Good, thanks, is the baby sleeping?
That's good. yes, thank God.
It's going to be at rest, at least.
yes, at this hour I put her to sleep.
Oh, that's good.
And you how are you?
Good. I was watching a small program on TV, I like to watch on Wednesdays.
Ah, that's good. My cold is giving me a very bad sore throat.
Oh, I have allergies, but apart from those, I take vitamins to remove the symptoms.
That's what it says, but since I'm pregnant, I can not take a lot of things.
Oh.
So, I'm, you know. I'm not feeling very well today.
No.
But,
Ah.
anyway, I n-
The conversation is about the internet.  Do you use, internet?
I did it, it is like I, I use it everyday.  There, we, eh, you know, we have e-mail, we have, eh, eh, we do everything that we have to do with the bank
I look for information, recipes, I go to the library.
Mmh.
I don't buy much, but, if we are going to buy something, I always do like, eh, some research.
Aha, aha
Eh, searching for products, to see where I can get the best price.  So that, internet, for us it is, it is, it is like, you know like having an
encyclopedia, let's say,
Mmh.
at home
yes, it is good.  I li- I use it too to find work, to look for information, for the girl in school.  But, to
for things of, to find people on the internet, I don't like that.
No, me neither.
I don't believe in, in, in that of- I believe you find, there are many crazy people, lots of, lots of trash of that kind that, that they put on the internet and
it happens then that it is not what it seems.  There are many people who have used it and, and, they have gotten married and all.  But I, I have never entered to
Well, I
to chat rooms what they say.
yes.  Eh, and,
I have never talked to anyone
I, before, Uhm, used to, log into chat rooms. But, they weren't, you know, to look for people, or whatever, they offered various topics.
But, it wasn't, Uhm, you know, after a while, I didn't like it. Because, people acted like, I don't know, they said stuff ...
that they ..
It wasn't truth.
yeah, or,  things they normally wouldn't say, you know, things got ugly,
Okay. Okay. Okay.
And I didn't like it at all. So, after a while, about a month or two, I stopped. But,  because I would rather talk to people, not, you know,
stand there, in front of a machine.
Okay.Okay.
But , you know, I have one
And, that, that has also meant a lot of troubles for couples, I think.
yes.
Because, it has brought  many couples apart as husbands become, or women go online and meet people and spend hours, and hours, and hours, and more hours are lost to the internet.
I don't, I don't use it that way, but my niece sends me jokes from  Puerto Rico, and, and my son sends me pictures of the baby, the new baby, and that's why I like the service a lot.
Because I can see my granddaughter very often and follow her life month to month.
yeah, that's something that we do too. We take pictures of the little girl and we send them to all our friends, and well, not every month currently, but, it used to be every month.
Okay. Okay
And, I like that a lot because, that way, at least people that we know, our family that's away, they can see how she's growing.
Yeah, it's that, that's something we do a lot, I had forgotten about the pictures.
Yes, the pictures , it's, it's lovely, I love them. But, also, Uhm, what I don't like so much, is  as they were saying, you know, you know that you send pictures and they keep them like in a ..
The file is there for a certain time, and then, afterward, I think that after six months, or something similar, it is delete.
The program, like, erases them if you have not taken them out.
Well, with us, already my little girl is nearly two years old, and never, it has never disappeared for us.  The photos still are there.  It´s that it depends, you know,
on what you are using.  But we still have pictures on the internet of, of, from when, from my baby shower.
Ah, well, when, I don´t.  What I do is that I don´t leave them on the computer, I put them on a CD,
Ah, very smart, sure
And I put the date on it, and we put a, I do a label on it, then, that way I have them.  If someone comes from the family, then we put them on the TV and on the computer.
Ah, very good.  What a good idea.
Sure, sure, yes, because if you leave them on the computer, that takes a lot of megabytes, I think.
Well, I always make copies, before putting it on the computer.
Sure.
Oh, I mean, on the internet.  I always make a copy on CD, and all that.
Sure.
Then, like that, I have the originals, that we took.  We take a bit more than a hundred every month.
Sure.
But, I don´t put on the internet any more than--let's say--thirty or forty.  Then I keep the originals and those that I put on the internet, because, the one that I put on the internet are already there.
You know, fixed up, you know, those are the best.  That's why I always have two, two categories of CD's.  Then, if she, when she grows up, if she wants all the photos, I am able to put it in for her, look, these are the best, and these are the, the originals, that you want.
Sure, yeah.
That way she has them.  But,
yes.
I had never thought about putting it in, in the television.
Yes, you can, ca- but, you have, I think, that the CD program is, to see it en the TV. Then, you buy a cable, I think that to the camera, and,
Yes.
And, and, you have it in the te- in the television. That's what we do. Whenever we have a party, then, we put it
in the CD. Later, when the family comes, you put it- we met, and everyone sits in the room and it, they see it, eh, in the television it looks very pretty.
Mhm, eh, eh, yes, that's a good idea.
Because it's a bigger screen too. And, if you put music,
Yes.
Then, it, it looks pretty. For that reason I like the, the internet, but, for the others of, of pair, they do not take me.
To me, to me either. And, and that too, like what you said before, that, you know, one never know who is going to know.
No, but, you see those children that sometimes are taken, that is, that, that they know these crazy people on the internet.
Yes.
He- here was a baby that is, that a type is deceptive, and no, from New Jersey, ah, that he was just over forty years old. And the baby had what? They were fifteen years,
and took him. Lucky that they could take. But, I will know God if t- he takes it and kills it. And, I don't really like either of the questions about the babies, sometimes.
Either, if, that is something that, that I already know, that when, you know, my boy is not more, more, we are going to say older, than the computer goes to,
The, I am going to have to change the room that is. Because, right now we have it like in a, not in the office, but, we're going to say, that is what we are calling it.
And,
It's a separate room that you use like an office.
Yes. But, I want to put it, we are going to say, in the room or, you know, somewhere where they are, they are using it, I can see
all that they are doing. Because, like before I was masterful, I know, you know, the, the, what the children do,
Mhm, mhm.
like they hide things from their parents and, and not that-
Yeah
I don't mean to say that my ch-
yes, they when you leave, they change the screen. What are you doing? Well, sometimes I tell my grandkids, what are you doing? No, nothing, just hanging out.
yes, it's-
And I'll open the other screen they had open, to see.
So yea,
But, you have to be watching because the computer is a bit, it's got lots of good things but it's also got its negatives.
Ah,
Because, look all this information that sometimes is provided for them, like terrorists making bombs. Even some students that, that killed people in Columbine School.
yes.
They got their ideas from the i- from the internet. So, sometimes, I mean, its got its, its good side, like everything. Like everything they got, it's got it's good points, and later, there are other points that, well,
that are disastrous too.
It all depends on how you use it, you know? yes that, but, no, I, I, I love the internet, but, I know too that when,
you know, you start to, n- no you start to, but, when the kids start to use it, you have to be a bit different
Ah yea, ah yea.
you know. Because, I think pretty often, they don't,
yes, now, now, well, now they've invented lots of parental control type things and all those things that,
yes.
that, at least, one, with that can control them a little more than before. But, before when none of that existed, well, you know that the kids would get in, in the chat rooms, eh, open up twenty thousand things.
Well, and still that, that happens, even if you have the parental controls. Because, many times, when I'm going to, look in my e-mail, you know, and I know this would happen to some of my students, that they are going to open the e-mail,
and pictures come out of, you know, of naked women, whatever.
MM
And, and that's something that, bothers me a lot, that I don't know how you can change that. Do you know?
Oh, is, is people that, eh, when I think that if you leave your password, and you don't close it, when you go to look at your e-mail,
if you don't closes it well, fast, let's suppose, you go to cook or do something, and you leave it like that, an open space,
many, there are many men that, many people that know how to get your, get your password from that moment that you leave it there for a long time, that's why they say that as soon
as soon as you leave the computer, well to close it. Do you understand me? To make sure that nobody gets your information. Well, then, what they do, that when they already get your password, they start sending
these, e-mails that, that, sometimes, what they bring are viruses, and sometimes they bring dirty things.
yes.
So, it all depends on, I mean, at least you have to be very careful with the, with the passwords, and with the information, specially the one from the bank and all that
when they sometimes they send you asking for information, that they say to put your pin number again because,
yes
there, you have to be very careful.
No, thank God, we, you know, nothing like that thru the computer, has happened to us. But, someone did steal the, the number of, of
social security
Aha.
of my husband a few years back. And, we had, a lot of problems.
Oh, yes, well, that's the, the identify theft. Well, that's being used a lot now in,
Because
on the internet everything gets stolen there, ,the personality. Because of this, you knowthat sometimes, they tell you to take ? Who knows you? or those free things, that offer you a thousand free things onthe internet. And, you go and start to __ it  . And then
when you begin to wonder about the data and all, the name of your mother, the date of birth and all these things, then, it is not good to give this information.
Hello, good evening.
Hi, good evening, uh, I am Nicole, I am calling from New York
Hi, I am Norma here from Atlanta, Georgia.
Hi, how are you?
Good, and you?
good, good, we spoke before, right
uh, I don't know
No, no, I spoke with someone from Atlanta
yeah, yes
But, I don't know
mhm
What country are you from?
I am, I am from Peru
A yeah, eh,
And you?
I, well my family is Cuban
yeah
eh, But, I was born here in the United States
Oh, Okay and so then, What do you think about the nol?
About the telemarketing, I do not like it, I do not know who like it.
yes
people call to sell anything eh, i don't know
no, is, is is referring, to , is referring to teleshopping, those that seem to pop-ups on the internet, who call you
eh, I think they are talking about when they call you
ah, when they call you bu phone
when they call you by phone and sell things, and also when
ah
when they send e-mails
ah, spam, yes
of course, the spam
huh
so, i don't know, not know if that convinces someone, I've never bought anything there and i never have looked any email seriusly
yes
i don't know and
ah, no, neither do I, I do not think I have bought things online, I've never bought things online, online
yes i have, bought things online but no
but not those sent by spam
of course
no, not other things you actually need, not
of course, well, must be, must be effective
no why
You have to look at those emails, and then you have to get convinced, otherwise not.
yea of course, I'm sure people invest in that, not just for that, they worry about sending those emails and the
um
and the small companies, o i know who does that, so, you invest money doing that.
of course
of course, by phone, yes by phone, yes it bothers me specially when someone is busy.
mhm of course
ha its annoying
i don't know, yeah yeah I've tried using those lists that say they dont call.
ha
i mean there's some that you can subscribe too and they don't call you but i dont know.
I'm subscribed, they sometimes call me
yeah I'm sure they do.
but not so much, not as much as before.
mhm I'm pretty sure they do, sometimes, and the people that sell are very emphatic
um yeah, i just tell them i cant really talk right now, i just don't wanna listen to their stories, because i wont be buying anything anyways.
ha
I'm not going to go buy
Of course I'm not interested
mm
yes sometimes there are people,and sometimes there is how do you say scams what they are called, that they sell them something and sometimes at the end is not even true, also you have those
yes, yes, yes also
fraudulent things they offer
yes
they offer selling by phone and even by internet also
yes it must be a terrible job my sister did that type of work like for a week
Ah yes, yes, a lot of families there that are employed
and she came home every day crying because everyone
nobody wanted to buy
of course, no, nobody wants to listen to you,
yes, not even listen to you.
in other words everybody hangs up on you, and she would get home so upset that she stopped working like that in a week
Of course, it's really a job that, it's not, it doesn't really reward you much, more like it gets you bitter
no, besides they pressure you, when you have a job like that they pressure you
of course
ah, to sell, I mean they are like listening to you, while you make the call the bosses are listening to you
yes
to see how you are selling and if you are not
they for sure pay them on commission.
sure and if you are not very efective they pay less so its like a bad job, sometimes i feel a little sympathy for those people
yes sometimes i think, is a good job for them they are doing as every other job
sure its like that, they are trying to win money too, but i don't i dont want to give them money that's the problem
mmm
i don't know if is, i answer the surweys, i mean if i was called with surwey that's what i want to know
OK
that if i am going to vote, for who i am going to vote, i don't know what to think about the politic sitution now, that's is what i answered in the surveys
mmm
i thinks that's good, that they have a thoughts diversity
sure
and i like to contrubuite with something, because for the research or for
mmm how research
sure, but you don't have asking me money, only answers, thoughts no money
sure because now you never know who really is, no true, who is lying
sure, so i also don't want it, what it is selling me, the newspaper, i mean i read the internet news
and i don't want newspapers in my home
yes
ehh and i don't know what else they are sell, ensurance policy, i dont want
sure, vacations
mmm, you won a car
yes that, that is really
you only need to go to Miami to pick it up
yes like you won this but you need to send certain amount of money to secure your prize
of course
one question
of course, no the majority of those things
mhm
yes they all go out to win money, because if it was not for that they will not be winning
of course
someone needs to pay the salary to those people
yes it really needs to be careful and no
mm of course, that is the other thing that sometimes
no
they call and they leave a message and say that you have to call certain number to go get your prize
yes
and the number turns out that is a number that charges you a fee for having called
mm
so it is like one of those 900 900 numbers that they charge you for having called so that
oh and on top of that everyone has to pay long distance call charges so really one needs to be careful after all.  No but paying a lot of people because they want more business
mm
This is not for a publicity stunt that they say.
I believe that is cheap. Or I beleive that is cheap for the company to do this type of publicity. or maybe they pay too little
to, to the people that are calling
yes
In fact many time people that are calling are not even in the United States
A,yes yes that is true
but they have communication systems.
mhm
It allows for people to call you from India
Oh yes just
and one does not know like they speak English in India
yes and the accent they have
Oh like they do outsourcing
yeah
like they pay people in those countries to call you and sell you stuff. can you imagine?
um
the little that they should be paying this people
Sure, because in India they do pay much that is why
They are making the calls, if they make one or two sales for each person same they are making money or if they do for that because they can not
Or they do not sell a lot that way,but since they pay little to employees they earn a little that is why
of course because in, in India it is a completely different way of life.  And there you pay, pay less to people
Of course since it is a very poor country
aha Then those people are anxious to work at any job, no
um I heard that once, that when like help desk when you have a problem with your computer or something like that and you call to help, that many times people who are answering they are in India.
yes, yes it is true, even eh, here the big ones, for example here the telecommunications company here in the south, Bell South
mmh
No and always, sometimes my husband calls, I call for a problem with the telephone, with our internet.  And yes, yes the people you call, who answer in India
of couse sometimes communication is very bad
no yes mmh.  Of course, and you, sometimes don't understand because they don't speak
of course or sometimes like there is a delay, like you hear but don't hear.
mmh mmh
in any case what happens with that communication if I am calling the phone company and the communication is bad but it is that they are far that is incredible
Of course, now yes
incredible to think that, because they are even in another timezone, there must be twelve hours difference with India
I suppose there are people, who work I don't know all the time, no
Of course or, or they work at night
Or they work, yes they work at night
that people have to call much more during the day that at night here so those people must be calling at night, I say, or working at night there
I mean if it is three o'clock in the afternoon here
yes something like that mmh
good, no, um maybe not, or perhaps it is better for these people to do something else
it's good to see that they clearly have to spend more than twelve minutes
it's not very clear, there is lots of talk on this issue that gives
mhm
There is not so much to tell
Sure, like the last time they called about the dates
yes
they call it dating
dating, that's because they translated it from English
yes it is a
is a machine which is translating from English to Spanish
is a question not a question, I told, what's dating? I didn't understand it very well
the dating, I was listening too, the dating that will be of the dating.
yes
And then I though in English date is date and dating, the dating
yes, instead of dating
what, what a slip, in other words a, a language study
ay, yeah
it's, it's supossed to be a linguistic study
Of course
And they can't translate the word to Spanish right
Sure Sure, that, that, Isn't that the best of all. That they don't even present the complete or right translation
Of course, it isn't a machine, is a ma-
Hello
hello good afternoon.

yes I am Peruvians
Oh, yeah, and how long, how many time have you been living here?
ten years, aha
ten years and you have family here or
no, no, no, i sa- s- came, i came to not but the temple I belong to
aha
there isn't, but of the religious association I belong then, that's why I came
I see
that way hmm

Hmm yes yes and what do you do in Atlanta?
What do I work for?
hmm
No uh- no i don't work, my husband does
oh i see

I'm with the childs here at home, well now they left
i see
they left me here alone, to rest
how many kids are there?
I have two, two young men that are
two boys, look at that?
two men
ah, okay
they are, you can already imagine how it is no, men are always more active, boys
yes, I can imagine, I grew up with my sister, in other words, the two girls so
ah, you have
I don't know how they are
ah and, and you are not married?
no, not yet
ah, aha
and I live, I live alone, but near my parents
ah, okay
mm
ah, there is where he is right? in
I'm twenty-seven years old
ah, you see, I'm forty-one
yes no I, I would really like to have a family, get married and have a family but
mm
I don't know, up until now, no,
He doesn't seem to be the, the right person
No, all the same my boyfriend is the same, I mean, we get along well maybe
mhm
but we have been together a year, I mean, we met each other a year ago
mhm
so we're waiting a little bit
mhm
but maybe hopefully yes,
yes, he's still young
yes, same as
yes well, when you get married it's different, it's
sure
no and you have like more obligations
sure
it's not the same freedom as before, specially if you have kids
sure sure, no, I like living alone, sometimes it's a bit lonely, like like, I like going out, doing things
mhm
see other people because otherwise, it's like too lonely, but I don't know, everything in its moment, I think
sure, that's right, that's true but standing or at least, being decided
sure
No, next to his... a little bit more or to deprive  herself of her freedom, it must be like that I suppose
sure, because, because it is a lot of work and if one has a family is a lot of work
yes
and I like to be alone, I tell you, I like, I like quietness, I like to think and read
mhm
I think that when I, when I have children
mm
uy, it is going to be very difficult to do those things
that is right, you are right about that,
so..
when the children are young, are babies, and no, I don't have time, not even for eating or taking a bath
sure, sure, I went to visit a friend who has a daughter
aha

really, there are many temples in Peru, there are a lot worldwide
and, children are also vegetarian?, right?
yes, of course
hey
They are vegetarian since the womb
and they never ask for meat, or anything?
No, it's in
No?
So far no, when they are young they are taught to be vegetarians
of course
If not, they don't ask and don't have any tendencies, when they are teenagers they start to ask themselves question and nobody can force them to do anything, is up to them
Of course
They have free will, they are not kids and they get old
right, right
no, they have to choose or have to see
yes, I was a vegeterian for many years
ah, yes? Mhm
like 10 years that I was vegetarian, but then I went to Chile, I was living with my boyfriend there and really and, it was difficult continuing been vegetarian
mhm
that, he ate beef and if I made something vegetarian
ah
and he put like a piece of meat in the middle, like he didn't want to eat like that
ah, really?
I left it, it was complicated and, and, when I Come back and continue I won't eat to much meat, like
ahhhh
well, m- never at the house I cook beef, only
when they eat heavy
right, I eat out or I go to the house of some else and made something but at mine house only vegetables and, I don't know,  green vegetables
I like it, mm I prefer to eat like that
mm
meaning
right, is more, more healthy, no?
mm
is healthier and even his digestion is better
Hmm, yes, not really, I don't like meat much, I like fish
hmm
I don't know, do you eat fish?
no, no, we don't eat meat, eggs or fish
no, not fish, but meat itself is not attractive to me
no. And you're still with the same boyfriend?
no, no, we broke up
ah, OK, now, maybe the other one, the other boyfriend, you should suggest it out of nowhere, he's not inclined to eat meat, and you can make him a vegetarian, it's easier if you're a vegetarian
I've never been in a relationship with someone who is a vegetarian, never
hmm
And, I've had like five boyfriends
yeah
like, serious boyfriends
yeah
I mean, more or less serious
yeah
but they all ate meat, and they liked meat, even the current one, too
yeah
He likes hamburgers and chicken
well, some people are inclined to that, it's a habit, they were born, raised that way, no?
mm, sure
they are used to eat meat and they don't know that there are other alternatives, they might have heard something, but they never imagined it's like that, no?
mm
if you are a vegetarian, you really have nothing to envy from them, you have nothing to envy people that eat meat, I've been a vegetarian for twenty years.
mm
no, and I really, you feel great, you are healthy, no, you don't even look your age
sure,
yes, vegetarian
yes, I don't, I rather not because
no, but it is different, aha
meat makes you fill full, it's heavy
sure, it's heavy and difficult to digest, the human body is not made for that, no? To eat meat, it's not made for meat-eating.
mm, but people are used to eat meat, they feel hungry so they eat meat
yes because, when you are starting to become a vegetarian, you really don't know how to balance your diet
mm, sure, you have to be careful, make sure you eat proteins.
sure, I mean, you have to eat proteins because if you don't
mm
find, you don't eat meat
mm
tofu, no? soy, eh, different products, no? so
of course and milk and yogurt and that, all
ah, I we do drink, we are lacto-vegetarians
that, OK, OK
no yes, it is that there are many things that one can ve- co- eat being vegetarian really I say, well, now since I am a vegetarian do you crave
I don't understand how people can eat meat
of course, of course, like you get used to and already
of course, and and you eat very tasty things no? being vegetarian that really you don't have to envy, mm
of course, no I like it, to me and in addition that I like it a lot like I like Indian food which has many vegetarian things and the
ah, si
Asian food in general, I like it a lot
Mmh
Chinese food Japanese food but well, I  like it I like fish, I do
ah, yes
but yes eh, what else was I going to ask you?  I had another question but it escaped my mind, o and do your children speak Spanish or English or?
well, not too much, they speak, eh, they know some words, they understand a bit of Spanish, no? something, but really a little
of course, of course, but because with your husband they speak in, they speak English
yes it is like so- it is not easy, no? I try to teach them a Spanish but since at school they speak English
mm
especially the older one
mm
hello well well I am Laya
hello how are you aha, we want to talk about what, I didn't understand very well the
ah yes we have to talk about spam, about unsolicited commercial publicity, about telemarketing of the OK, sometimes if they call you at home not to sell you stuff or they send you letters or they send you e-mails, that type of things
aha no because the phone you have to get another phone because my phone I have the volume I cannot I have to increase the sound
you can't hear me well
ah I heard you well but I didn't hear what the machine was saying
it is, it is that in addition the machine speaks very bad Spanish.
yes yes well it speaks Spanish with a gringo accent, you understand
yes in addition the accent well, much, I don't know many things really aI don't know you understand but yes yes
well the situation also in Spanish there are there are many words and ah, not only words but of
expressions, yes yes yes, yes yes yes
from different countries, from different regions that say certain things they call it different, you understand because I am here, here in New York and I was talking with
Puerto Ricans and they call it the orange
aha, Chinese
Chinese yes I could never accept that though a Chinese person comes from China
yes yes yes, yes yes yes, aha aha
a woman but that is coloquial then of their Spanish it is not the thing it is that, OK we were talking about telemarketing right
yes, yes yes
aha because I am ready to, I don't know if you know there is a list that you place your name on
aha, ahhhhh
with the government, and they cannot call you yes I believe that list still exists and I don't know where
then legally they cannot send you the publications that are unwanted
they can send it yes but they cannot call me
ah they cannot call you, OK, OK aha aha
the do not call list that started like, a, like two, two and a half years so the government used that list because they were saying that, complaining
mja, mja
that many calls during the nap and at a certain time of the day and all that, you understand so I put my number on that list
and they don't call you it really works, aha OK
no not to solicit, no but if I don't pay my bills they do call me
of course yes yes it would be good if they didn't call you for that
yes if I don't pay my bill they call me and that and also the mail the mail they are going to do many things you see
aha, aha
and I don't know if you have a computer but if you have a computer they send you a lot of
yes, yes well I have been living in the United States for only a year so I think that still the marketing companies haven't located me yet then to call me on the phone the truth is that I don't receive many calls of those that sell things no
aha
and through the mail a few things but not too many but via email yes it is a problem I mean I have several accounts of well
from the university here private and such and every day I delete like fifty publicity emails of
mm
that if watches, that if pills, that if treatments and well everything everything.
and what country are you from, you say that how many years have you been here in the United States
I've been here for only a year, yes yes, I'm from Spain, Barcelona

yes yes yes then, aha from Panama then good very good
yes but in Panamá, in Panama is commercial good, a small country, got it
yes i was in Costa Rica like very close to Panamá, i was in Costa Rica last year
yes yes but Panama is much more evolved compared with Costa Rica yes yes have allot
yes aha aha not that indeed my Costa Rica seemed a country that is nice indeed that no
oh yes eh
that you didn't see garbage on the street and i don't know
yes yes then the Puerto Rico is the most democratic country on the American continent
mja <?> , if they don't have an army either true
it doesn't have and army and all it's politics, the Costa Rica politic is the most, it's the most pacific one
mja <?> yes yes
i tell you the truth on a map close to United States there they have a different party and every party rules a year, or two or three ruling and then another one and they do it right
aja, aja
without army and nothing that a government must use force, got it
aja yes very good yes
ah but o lot of people doesn't know but in Panama we have lots of businesses, more developed
mja, off course, yes
go through Panama Canal and you will see people from around the world in Panamá, from all over the world and you have a lot of people that comes there
mja
i was working with the right boats with the big boats as they say junk ship and wanted to be right and they stayed in Panama
aja aja clear clear
and they do not return to their country so that many many people who could not and have had problems with thepolicies at home and when they are working on the ship
aja aja I see
when they came to Panama you know how they say they arrive by ship and mixed with the Panamanians and them
understood. How many inhabitants does Panama have? In the entire country
ah like three thousand the entire country like three thousand
wow, only three thousand, wow how tiny, how little
yes it's a small country, yes a country but it has well developed business
wow how small aja aja
yes very small with only three thousand dollars three thousand people that are there but not three million of that there
ah ah ah worth worth worth worth worth worth three thousand I say that is smaller than my worth three million people is too little but I think it has three million
three million three million no no no that's three million, not three thousand because a friend was here in in in in New York right Brooklyn and was I was in business in a library
mja mja mja mja
a library of business and I noticed the books eh phones yellow of Spain right and you know what a yellow yellow book a phone book is the phone numbers
yes yes it, yes yes it's the yellow guide yes yes yes yes mm
the yellow right the yellow of all Spain is not very bigh like it is in Brooklyn and Brooklyn is a small part of the United States, it is in the city of New York which has five boroughs rightg
yes yes yes yes mja mja mja yes yes but there are many people
Brooklyn one of the boroughs and the page entered in Spanish isn't there
mja mja and you have been here many years
yes yes about thirty but I've been here more than thirty years here yes yes, I've been here many years here and I am more American than Latin
aha, no no I know it show because of your accent when you speak English, when you speak English eh I mean
very good too, the thing depends on the person and
mja mja, sure, mja mja mja
education and the people that you're with all the time, you understand because if you've been to university of something like that you still keep on talking in that way, you understand, because I'll tell you the truth
mja, mja
ah I have a teacher, a teacher here from right I went to Brooklyn College she was the... a teacher of a teacher of of Spanish, teaching Spanish
mja, mja
but her class was Spanish literature, you understand like Don Quixote, Lazarillo de Torme and all that
uh yes I remember from when I was attending high school
and I don't remember Lazarillo de Torme the first, the first picaresque novel
mja mja, mja
the thing is that she's the worst teacher I have had in my whole life and she learned Spanish from the book not speaking at home
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's very different yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
like the machine, the machine that you heard about but she speaks better than the machine see but she knew a lot of Spanish very well, she had to study so much in Spain that when the moors she had guts and all that
mja
she had to visit certain how do you say it in New York we have a museum right
mja, ah yes aha which museum is that, aha
where they teach you a lot about Spanish architecture, see and the influences that the moors have had ah in the influence of Spain there is and we have certain words like the word ojala it's Arabic yes
I hope there are many, there are many Arab words in Spanish it is not of
yes because when they say I hear you say I hope that we go to the movies tomorrow and something like that the movie, right
mja a of course of course I had never noticed mja mja
"ojala" (I hope) that but what I am saying is "o-alá", God Allah you understand, but that it is a different thing but talking about telemarketing and spam you say that you don't get much ah
I don't get many calls or paper but I do get lots on e-mail. through e-mail, yes a lot on e-mail
no no, e-mail right oh please, oh believe me, oh I get through I have Yahoo, which one do you have?
I well it is that I have several I have Hotmail, Gmail, I have the one from my American University, and the one from my Spanish University, I mean that
oh please
I spend the day looking at different mails, it is horrible, yes yes
and not not just horrible but those people are like how you say it in English right I am saying it, I am telling you practically OK they are as you say creative
like like like aha yes
they know how to write things so you want to read them
and
or that they tell you things that you want to look at what is inside I tell you that they are like how you say it, ah
they have imagination no, they have creativity
imagination yes their imagination they are so
also there is one I get almost every week, I get one written in French
aha
that is well they tell me this woman who writes is the widow of an African dictator who has died and that he has I don't know how many millions
ohhh oh millions oh oh no oh
And they ask for help to get those millions, and apart from that, i mean,
oh no, look they have increased a lot in the past six months,
yes yes yes yes
that has increased a lot it is telling you that I won something in England and that I have to go to England to claim my thousand pesos or the dollars they use ad that oh just forget that
oh yes yes also ye yes I ask myself if somebody really believes these stories
but they say it yes yes
because I don't know it seems incredible that somebody can bite but if they send them is that somebody I don't know someone will bite
but look they send, most of that is sent to another country ad they send like two thousand right two million
es yes, yes sure
ad they wait that one or two people, you see what I'm saying
yes yes yes today it doesn't cost any effort to send an email to millions of persons that is but I don't know it seems incredible to me that somebody could bite
yes ehm incredible that they say one they tell me that if the man they have about fifty thousand pesos if he doesn't answer
yes yes yes, yes yes some stories, some extraordinary stories
fifty thousand, fifty millions and I did not tel- and I that that that they are crazy and they are from many countries they say and many say that they are from Nigeria, Nigeria and ehm ehm
yes yes yes from Nigeria and also like I am in the university we organize conferences
aha
then there are people that register for the conference then they ask you like money to come well some complicated stories that sometimes on does not know if the people are true or is a lie  that is with that of the internet
oh
sometimes you don't know if if you are talking with somebody for real or if they are totally pulling your leg, it is
but and the thing ehm I don't think that the government culd, how it could be it could not know who i the person that is sending, who i what is doing that
oh yes, is that it is complicated because it is so easy to hide your identity no that
yes and also the thing that when they send all of those letters if ehm, it is difficult when say well ehm well you know that what they are trying to achieve you bukcs, understand you money but
mha

Ah in
Well we need to talk, we getting away and we are not going to get paid, today's theme is telesales no
yes
and, what do you think?
yes
When they call you on the phone to sell you something
I don't like it
nothing at all of course
and you? uh
I don't know anybody that, that, that likes it, actually. I don't know anybody that ever bought anything on, on the phone
yes, me neither, me neither, I think it's always bothersome. More than anything
Let's see, I think that, somebody must buy something otherwise
it must be, they must make some money with that otherwise they would not do it
yes, Of course they must make a little because I
I mean
never heard of anybody not annoyed, and I think it hurts them more
um
because is like negative publicity for them
How?
Because if they are calling people to their homes and  bothering them.
hum
well people is not giving good opinion basically not
Not not, there must be people that sometimes I think are alone. Like older people, Yes he is alone and,
and like, likes to talk.
yes, well, yes
they could start to talk, also sometimes. Older people are like, they are more confused, like they can
you can get convinced to sell them something
he can convince them a little more.
yes sadly
But I think that most of the young people, now I don´t know, I don´t know, there must be young people who could be convinced but, I think that very busy people, don´t want to loose their time in
in, having a conversation like that.
Of course, of course. And spam just
well they are in my email and go to the folder as something different
Of course
the email does that like automatically.
and then is less annoying.
yes like that, I don´t even see it, I don´t even open that folder, is like it is there always. And is, the site deletes it after, thirty days or something like that
And don´t. Don´t you check it to see if
Some times almost never, I go to look at them, but they arrived for hundreds, for example right now there are like two hundred and fifty and I get bored just looking
I do check it every time, I go over the spam email cause it happened to me some times that an email was not a spam
uhm, yes
Most people don't check his spam file, It happened to me once I wrote to somebody
and a have no answer
maybe in the spam file
and that was because it was in his spam file and he did not check it before he erased it. got it?
sure
I checked some times, almost always it is o.k. there are only spam in that file.
yes
I don't get spam in my inbox
That's good, what service do you use?
what?
what email do you have?
I have several, Yahoo and Hotmail, Yahoo is good because spam is very protected and you do not get viruses
uhm, well a never openuh an spam email but i check the list, just to see if some other person has been called.
mm, i do not open them because I think
No, but some times you can get emails from people you know, and they are viruses
uhm, yes
and you cannot open them, that's good.
if that is what they say. Sure, I don't know if that really happens, I believe that we have to open open de email and open the attachment too as a
the what
a file, and we have to open something that comes together with the email too
yes
because if don't I don't think it can send a virus in that form, for just simplu sending the email
I don't know you have tu download all the file, but that's what hotmail don't let you do, it doesn't let you download the file
I see
because the truth is that it has many tricks, the emails those of virus and often seems that if it is a a person that you meet that is sending you something interesting
mmm
and it is a virus, So we have to be careful. and the ones that send internet advertising, I mean the ones that send spam they are really selling things
yes, yes
I don't understand that, who buy to them
yes they are selling and pornographic things also
yes ,almost always
I don't know pilds
yes all the illegal, they sell by that way
mm
eemm, pills that are not approved, that promise  miracles and people believe it
mmm
Who can believe that
Well it must be people I don't know that there is people, I mean that let themselves get conviced by those things, like they allow
yes sure
I don't know, I know a woman, that, that yes, there are some emails that talk about someone, I don't know there are some emails that say that someone from the government
need help and if one puts money eh, they are going to retunr more, I don't know like ten times mores, or something like that and yes I know a woman
that got trapped
I mean yes, well, she always believes and she is not very well.  She is like little crazy and she always believes
She always believes and she lost a lot of money.
Because that is very dangerous, that is very dangerous, because there are lots of people who lost money that way
yes, yes that is true, that is I mean selling things, I believe many people don't buy, but they say
that one is going to earn a lot of money, the, if one sends money they are going to return a lot more, I believe there are people who dream about it
yes that yes, there are people who got trapped
like that
Thas is the lack of intelligence, that is the absence of thinking because, they are going to send me money for free, and how is that I am recieving myself from all the people in the world who have an email? and
Sure, sure, sure.  There is always people that believe that.
yes
There are the only ones in the world who are going to earn with that.  Then, there are people that dream about it.
Sure
It is like- like gambling, I mean.  There are people who gamble and think they are going to earn a lot of money despite everybody in the world loosing with that.
yes, practically, the bank, the casino would not exist
sure, sure but always there are people who still are going to gamble and they think they are going to be rich
yes
And well, well with betting some do make money, there must be a few.  But a few
The ones who go to have fun for a day, those who go because they don't have an addiction, and they need to play and those who dedicate themselves professionally.  Because there are certain games, I think that you hear a game, blackjack.
Of course.
in which you have probabilities if you play well of making money.
Of course, or Poker also a bit, or not.
what, I don't know.
yes poker I think has- it is like
I believe that it goes but I suppose that
it is like psychological, poker, because you have to pretend like you have more than you do have or less than you have, I don't know
it is like a game like of
well poker I don't know, I saw a documentary with people from -MIT who had their tricks to count cards, which is illegal, of course, the casino is very smart, for one thing that you can do to beat the casino, they forbid it.
of course um
And it not cheating really, cheating would be well, marking the cards having
Of course, no, no this is like
cards under the sleeve, but if you are capable of counting cards, why is it going to be cheating?  Then it arrived, there from casino to casino so they wouldn't get caught.
Of course
winning a little bit on each, not making a lot in each casino not to call attention, but they ended up catching them and now they are not allowed to enter the casinos.
ha, look.
and they had to go to Europe to win at casinos in Europe.
hah
it was funny
look
But, but if nobody will
I think it's good that people earn money, because people always lose money, there should be some that earn it
of course, no one will just give you money, people want to believe it
uhm
And it's, it's very unusual that someone gives you something, very unusual. They always want something in exchange. And the lists, have you ever put your phone
yes, and I'm registered
And does it work?
Yes, they call me sometimes, but less. I mean less than before. And, it takes a while to start working, like, like it takes a few months
And after that you notice it, they tell you, eh, we're going to put you on the list, and the list starts in three more months, or something
But after that you notice less calls
Good
There are still people who call, I don't know but
The problem with the list is that it's not mandatory. I mean, it would be good that it was mandatory, if you put your phone number on that list, they can't call you
hmm
But it's not, it's just a list for companies that don't want to bother with calling people
hmm
who have already said they don't want to be called, because it's a waste of time and money
Uh
But yes, there are other companies that don't care and try anyways just in case.
Sure.
They're the ones that don't look at the list and they call you and waste your time anyways.
Yes, yes, i believe that, of course, i don't think, not all companies do.
And they lose money.
Not all of them pay attention to the list, i don't now, maybe not all of them have the list, i don't know, i don't know who gets that list.
Uh.
Er, maybe it's less, like, i don't know, i don't know if you put your name there, put your number there
I know, yes
But they call you anyways
I don't get any, I'm lucky, my phone was new
Uh
And i put it just on January, i put it on the list and the calls i have received are services of, of the companies with which i already have services from.
Oh, that's good.
They want to sell me even more services.
Uh
And that's very annoying too.
Uh
But, next time, and they have called me from the same bank
um uh
I have been called many times for the same reason, next time I´m going to tell them to please put me on their bank list
of not to call
Of course, of course
I think they should have a list like that, because me, their client, whatever
Of course
If a client of them tells them not to call anymore, well dumb of them if they continue to call because the client could get mad and go away
Of course
so, I´m going to try it and see if they stop from calling me from the bank because they always want to sell me the same and I have said not , why do they want to sell me it again?
um of course
If they think I´m going to say yes because of their insistence I don´t understand it
um
Hello
Hello
yes
is Tammy
Alex
Alex again How are you?
fine
I don't think there are a lot of people that do this survey
I don't think there are many people, no
Because I've already talked to you like three or four times.
Well they are going to pay us.
and another person, two or three I know, no, I think so after we talk about what they say, I think so
yes
eh, is not our fault that they don't have enough people that got into that survey
yes, all the same
is funny
I'm always here at this time
And today I almost did it early and I couldn't, so I say I'm going to call later and I forget, and suddenly,
I always call at nine sharp. And is nine sharp.
Yes
Good that you think of telemarketing
There is still I think the same, I like some and some I don't. That way, each time it arrives in the mail. three arrive
again in order to refinance my house I say no, these people don't leave anyone alone
sometimes good offers
Yes
I like the marketing more by mail, because it's not as, how do I say, it's more private and one can see the offer without the pressure of the
of the call
yes, that is true, too true
And sometimes, there are good offers, I don't approve everything I receive
Mhm I always check them
I look at the things sometimes
Yes, because there are some like one can find something good if you look, but on the telephone I don't like this
Good, everything in life is a risk, I think that there are not many things that are a risk. Everything is a risk. Sometimes you are going to win and sometimes you are going to lose, true.
Yes
The problem is when they are molesting you at an inopportune hour, or when they are taking advantage of someone
and sometimes they call me early, and of course they can't call you after 8. They call me before 8, but I don't answer
Yes, it doesn't really matter to me. I usually don't answer the calls.
Yes, I have noticed
yes, I know that it's telemarketing
If I pay attention to the caller ID, depending, if I don't know who it is then I hope the voice machine picks up, if I recognize the voice, then I pick up.
yes
sometimes yes, sometimes if I grab the phone and say, oh, I know who it is and say, no thank you, no thank you.  oh, sometimes I pretend I don't speak English
so that they leave me alone I don't speak English, there
And they call you, you in English or Spanish.
in English
Never in Spanish
No, they have not called me in Spanish only in English
and in And because here, here like there is a lot of Hispanic people in los Angeles sometimes they call in Spanish
yes over here no over here it has not started yet, well.  That is what I have to say
well I think that you are the only person that speaks Spanish in Seattle
no over here there s quite a few
According to the Fisher survey
there has to be because if here if there is quite a few, what strikes me that there is quite a few Mexicans over here
yes
there is not a lot, there is Panamanian but I don't know many and
but they don't do marketing in Spanish
no no nob co-, they have not called me to nobody to me, as far as I know other people I don't know but they have not called e.
and the other thing that bothers me, sometimes there is, there is a lot of spam from marketing on the computer
there is if
there is quite a lot of that, that should be more controlled by law.
I got in , in my email and I HAD NINETY seven.
sometimes I have a special email to filter
yeah
and then I have my email only telemarketing
yes its true
and I have to throw them have to take about ten or fifteen minutes to throw away when I could be doing something more important
too many,is because they send you so many things that you do not ask for.my husband was laughing yesterday he got an email from a nudist beach for nudist and I was laughing
yes wow
he was mad,said from where from where they think I am from ? and I was laughing
that is incredible.
had caused laughter because i had all cards in my hand. but the one they send him that if you see the outside don't know does not say what it is.
He had in the, in the jacket for no one to see.i say who can see you, who is going to see your stuff. I did laugh.
you.Why they always send that? i say.i don't know don't know.
but sometimes there is good stuff, about a year ago I got for a thing to go a show around here close
yeah
and I won some tickets to las Vegas and Disneyland tickets
ah
and I did not spend a thing
that is good.yeah
there,there are times when good things come from marketing
but one must be careful what one get into
One must be careful especially with computer and credit cards, because many times it is trapped.
mmmm
I have a friend who was misled in marketing
aha
The bank removed money from my account, because they thought I gave out the number.
There is mmmm
and they charged me two hundred dollars to apply for the card
I remember when I went to see my lawyer, the girl who works in the office, the secretary,was crying and I told her not to cry anymore.
One of these telemarketers has removed five hundred dollars from my account
yes because
first a hundred and fifty dollars and the lawyer with whom she worked was going to fight to help her with that.
That happens quite often, you should never give your financial information to telemarketing party.
People does not think about that
because they are going to steal and it's legal
I too, when I buy things on the internet, my husband and I have a bank account that we put money in, that we only use towards the internet.
so if we are going to spend sixty dollars, that is what I would put on the card and use it.
and you know another thing it has left me
is that
eh, I have received letters from these ah, foreign companies that want me to send money to the United States.
Exactly, me too.
and they want a bank account so that they can make the transfer. I think it's a trap because they are not going to give you anything, they are planning to steal the money that you have in the bank.
I heard something about that in the news, that they had caught someone from the government of a city, a, a city in Africa.
yes, from Africa.
they were, mm
and Great Britain too. I once investigated a company that was offering me an offer through which I was supposed to get a lot of money.
aha
and it turned out that that company didn't exist.
yes, I
They wanted to take my money
ah, yes, that people, I didn't buy that stuff of giving them my bank account, no, no, no, no, they've called me from Canada, they say they want me to buy
lottery tickets.
mhm
in Canada and I say, what for? I say, if I don't buy lottery tickets in here, I do it rarely, why would I want to buy tickets from the Canada lottery!
yes
no, that's a no, and they say "you are going to be rich", no, no thanks
yes, they always say that.
ah yes, a card, they sent my husband a card, my son's girlfriend, that said she had won some earrings
diamond earrings, a clock and some  money and she had to send them around two hundred and fifty dollars so that she could get the prize.
yes
and she tells me, because she's only eighteen years old, i tell her, don't go crazy  telling what to do
and, and also many times it has happened that I've won things on the computer
hmm
but i have to do the survey, and at the arv- survey i have to buy something
yes
and, i already know it's a scam, because one gives his name, address and phone
hmm
and then they want more, they want you to buy something
aham, yes
then i never do and I've never received anything, i've never received something, it's like some marketing
yes
there should be laws about something like that
yes because every person, there's people like this, that's easy for them to get into things like this, when they say there's something free, i tell you, when it's free
free or, or they've won something
hmm my husband always tells me when it's something like that to read everything, the, the small words down there, read it good, good because they can take something from you, that you have to pay something
but it's hard after you pay to get something from you
i think that's called an enganghe in Spanish
hmm so we have to, i always tell that to my sister and sons
and, and I am tired of this happening in Spanish also
Read everything yes, I have not received anything in Spanish, yet
It is going to arrive these days
I tell you people never thinks about that I am a Latin woman when they see me so I play it also.  So to with that that now you have this that
that you can call that they take away your phone that they take away that marketing that is also good
yes that is good
yes but i do not know, i do not know, i probably can ask my husband since he knows.  because he says it is free of charge,  you type your phone number, and your name, and they take you out of it
from the list they have.  because there are some that you tell them and they continue to call
and I believe that they are going to keep calling because they say they make the calls randomly.  then they are not, but they  since they know your name also.  if they are doing it randomly
because
how are the going to know your name
because they buy the names, the list of names
mhm
and sometimes they go, like one time they told me that they go like this with each number, from one two three four fine, not them, they do not know my phone number but
they go exactly, almost, one two three four five, the numbers like this.  They dial them directly like this
yes
so it is easy for them not to lose any becayse they are doing that at the order
then i do not believe we agree,  the best marketing is regular mail marketing
mhm
or newspapers
Good night. This is Milred from Connecticut
Oh, Good night, this is Mercedes, from Philadelphia
How are you?
Nice to meet you. Well, we have to talk about politics
Yes
What do e think about it?, This is kind of a hard topic, because, well, I have been living here for 6 years, but I have never been interested in politics, I can't vote, so
And why can't you vote? aren't you registered, or you don't want to be registered
Because I'm not still a citizen
Oh, Okay
I'm only a resident. Then, I can't vote, so
But doesn't residents vote?, I thought so...
No, we don't vote. You have to be a citizen for voting. Do you vote? Have you ever vote?
yes, I always vote
Oh
I had a time when I thought "I won't vote, why?" But, then a get involved working with one of the parties. Then i realized that we need to vote, specially for Hispanics
To raise our voices, and our vote is there, counting
And, what do you think about Democrats and republicans, and their differeces
Well, I vote for my own party. But Sometimes when I like a candidate from the other party, I vote for them
Mmm
Hos is it said?, I don't know, I am not a fan of the party, Am I an idealist of the party?, I'm
when I see that a candidate will do something good for the community or for the state, well, I vote for him, even though it's for someone else.
And, I vote for the other candidates who, are of my party. But no, I mean, no I don't mean to. How do you say?
Only with the line of the pol- of the party.
yeah,yeah
Ah, ya, ya,ya. ah and of, say, of what the people say- well, what the people, the conception that the democrats are more liberal, and that the republicans are more
conservative. What do you think of? the conservatives. What do you think about that?
Yes, I think that they are a little more, more conservative in certain aspects. But, in some other things, well, sometimes, they lose control.
yes.
Yeah. That is why, I think they don't maintain the power much, because it's like they get afraid. After things come, like they
get friend, and they pull back, or stay.
yes, what I think, too, is that, eh maybe, ah, it's not much to stay in the middle. right? it's that
they are in one side, well. They are like very extremist, but they have it in the extreme. I think that is why
but, the fact of being conservative indicates that, you know, they maintain the margin of certain things that they don't want to happen. Because they tight up a lot to
the matter of ethics, and matter of politics, you know. They go through a lot, I think, the concepts, the democrats, well what they see goes through
even, even though the people are all over him, well, they go right away, you know, they do it. Even though the whole world are all over him when not, they don't want what they have
been putting. But really, well, I don't know. In my, in my country, at least, the democrats, have had control for like twenty eight years.
Mhm
And,  after those twenty-eight years that the leader died, that he was the strongest leader of that party, well, then,it has been, you know, a couple years they vote for democrats
others, the next other four vote republican, and the democrats return again, and they come and put the republicans dependent. Like they depend of how they see the situation in the country. If they see that the country, in those five years he has not done anything, well, they take him out quick.
It's like that here, it's like that.. and it's like that here too. But sometimes that, that is in my country, I say too. But sometimes its not much, eh, I would like for them to realize that sometimes it's matter of the person, not so much the party.
ha ha
true? or something else, i don't know because, hes on the other side
yes, i think that, if a candidate, um, if a party has a candidate a good one, and um because, look, this mane that governed Puerto rico, that was luis munoz marin,
he governed it for twenty eight years, he did good things, you know, he made the country progress, he made the country, well the truth is, the country when it was behind, he made it go forward
mhm
so, well, he maintained its control,the control from everyone, and then he died, and lots of generations, that stayed, that followed him
even though he was dead, he was still a leader, to be honest, they didn't see that it wasn't what he did, they saw that, because since they were
a popular party that was democracy, that was, was leaving, how do you say? hes leader, it wasn't to be honest, because they saw they weren't doing anything good.
mhm
I don't think it should be that way, you know? i think that if a candidate, well, you see can do better, give him the opportunity,
but, sometimes, um, what i wanted to say aswell, is that people, that's with a lot of parties, right?
um, and that um
don't finish, you think
yeah, i mean that he doesnt, maybe, the candidate, Right? but since they vote for the party, they, is what they make me, mm, i don't think its good, but, at the same time
uh there's people that do good, just without classifications,uh or the capacity of the candidate, but with the way he is.
ha ha
That happens a lot in my country, that's right, people leave, they fall in love, like they say
Yes, for a face, for a face and a
uh uh and for what, for, i don't know, for the impression thaty you've given that person, uh
for a few gestures, but
your resume, or your curriculum, Right? If of what you can do or you cannot do.
well, but, ah, always, every politician promised, I will do this, I will, I will, I will, and when the win the position , they forgot of what they have to do
Or, or maybe they don't forget, maybe they find so much, so much oposicion.  Because, specially when a team wins like the democrats, and,
and casi the whole comrade are win by republicans, well, then it so much difficul to complete what was promised.  Well, no everyone of the republicans are going to approve new laws, neither they are going to approve thing that he decide to do, Understand?
Mhm
And, they are the majority, and the ones going to vote, a, a voting and to count the decision, well, many times, I see that it can be very difficult,
to a lider that, that is good, but that won't win the rest of his team, well, it is very difficult, you know, eh the em-em
put everything that he can do on favor of, of the community.
Mhm
because, then, the others won't give him an opportunity
Mhm
I believe that, depends of, of, you know, yes, yes, let suppose, if win the democrat, and almost all of them are democrats,
yes,
but when a democrat wins, and all the rest are republicans, they make their lives dif-
and, and that is something that I think is counterproductive.  Right? because one think that when everything is done, one would like, maybe, a ideal world that one with power, everyone will work for the good of everyone.
but, they are some that work for their own benefits, truely, the community.
right, right, and that is the reason, let's say, for example, here, it is divided, said, when the pass the laws, Right, First the congress, then the senat and the the president, right?
but, usually, a lots of laws come but iniciative from the President, Right, but, the Senate have to approve them and if the Senate is
a team with the majority to the opposite team, it is a great problem.  Meaning, is good, I think so because is good ah, em
had some control, Right? equality between teams.  Right, but at the same time, like lower the speed that, the things, and maybe like, like more burocrats, is why I am trying to say.
yeah, yeah, yes, it is lots of bureaucracy, I-
yes
It goes this way, then starts the fights and problems, and
and something else, also, one of which I have read about, something they do here in the United States, for example, I would say they are lots of laws,a as if it's a presidential initiative, right?
But,usually they do as a group Right? of,eh of incentatives in only one document,for example Right? like the they present one time
to the, to the senate.for example one day,and like addendums or added Right? at the law that there is another law,another law maybe the people do not support  those other. but they support the principal one
But, like those were attached to those, do not pass. Then they say no.No, we do not pass because that that Right? and maybe the main idea it was were all agreed upon but,now
They have to start again as new.
yaeh. that is why, I tell you that when. when they are not the same party. always they bring many problems. then some want one thing and others another.
Mhm.
So, no one never knows what they are going to, indeed, in me I in politic, well I tell you co-I envolved like how,
after I got here. been like like four years ago. that I started to participate to take more action in the,because I saw that they did not want to approve many things for the hispanics,and
that they were not treating to well.So I got involved in politics to help.But also there is a lot of tell me and be told and they take you out they look for even the skin you have to take out all you have,you know.
Mhm,mhm
All that want to look to find you. if you run to, to any porition forget it. that they investigate your family, and they take that if you sell this if you had this, that if your son did that, that if your aunt is, was that
So I like that well. I said no, I can not be in this shot.
Mhm,mhm
So, I keep working and I help them, but no, I did not get involved you know to run for nothing. that I have nothing to be embarrassed, but since I do not like the those
and especially, I find that whites here try to manipulate and control a lot.
Mhm.
especially in the republic party. The democrat is a little more, they have a little more of,
yes.
of, of that for the hispanics,but the republicans are like racist they are more of for them.
yes,yes that yes A-i that. in that I agree,yes. that maybe because the same they are,don't know,
Hello?
Hello.
Hi, Em, so Nicole, I speak of New York
I am Laia from Philadelphia.
Hi, how are you?
Good, and you?
Good.
Very good.
Um.
Good, we need to talk about politics, right?
In politics. We talked before, or not?
As?
I think we talked about it earlier.
Yes?
yes. Are you from Spain?
yes. yes, we talked. Ah, very good. Uh, uh, uh.
Ah, yes. We discussed it earlier, um, beyond being a college student, right?
I am a student in the Pennsylvania college, here in Philadelphia.
Yeah. yeah, I remember. Good, let's talk about politics.
yes, yes, yes, yes. Very good.
What do you think, as a foreign student here, about local politics?
Well, here. I'm surprised about the fact it only exist to big parties, that people only have two options, because, well, in Spain is really
Um
well, a little chaotic, because there is
Mmm
There are many more options, then
Well
You have really conservative parties, center, ecologist, liberals, then
Mmmm
For example, I'm from Barcelona, so, there are more Catalan parties, less tan, I don't know, so
I see
Options, more or less big, we have almost 6. If you count smaller parties, we have like 20
Oh, well
But, with representation in the parliament there are six parties, then
I see, okay
Here instead, I'm surprised it's black and white
Sure
And
Sure, and sometimes they are not so different from each other
yes, that's the problem. Because if they were
Gray, and gray. Bad and worse.
exactly, exactly yes, yes, yes, yes, that sometimes they are not so different, and, you can, you can feel a bit without representation, no, almost
yes. Um. Yes, yes, there are small parties that really have a very different perspective than the rest, but they don't have,
Um, um. Um, um.
they don't have enough support.
Sure.
And they don't have enough money.
Um, um. Um, um.
em, so that there really are two parties.
Um, um. Um, um.
I mean, when one, I mean, always in elections, em, when you're going to vote here, em, they show the parties, including the small ones, em, eh, when you vote, but, the other ones, it's such a minimal percentage.
Um, um. Um, um. Um, um. Um, um, sure.
Only once, in the presidential elections there was a, a, a, a man that represented, represented like an independent party
Um, um.
it's, eh, Ross Perot Eh.
what, what's his name?
Perot? P-E-R-O-T
Oh, OK, yes, yes, yes, that was a man, um
That was a few years ago, and all the same he, I mean, he won many, many votes, but
yes. Um.
it's not enough to win, but
Um, um. Um, um. Um, um.
I don't know, he was a very, very rich man.
yes, no, he was a multimillionaire, yes
And sure. He could be and idealist, with another perspective, you typically can't
yes, yes, and well, even if, I don't know, there wasn't in the end, there was
You can't.
Nader or is it Naser or something, Ral-, Ralph, um.
Um, Ah yes, Nader, Nader, yes. He's also,
Sure, voting for him is like throwing your vote to the trash because you know he's not going to win
Sure. Sure. He's not a, I mean, he's like a symbolic candidate
Um, yes, yes, yes.
You can't really vote for him because he won't win, one knows that. He knows that too
yes. Um, um. Um, um.
he has lots of ideas, very good ones, in my opinion, but
Uh, uh.
I wouldn't vote for him just because, I really care about who
Sure, sure.
who's really got a chance of winning the presidency
Sure, the, what happens in Spain is that, ah, you vote, I don't know, you vote for a very small party
Um.
but then, before the, the same important results, because you know with the alliance that occur, since neither party has the majority it really results in a smaller party being very decisive and very important in saying who, who commands, this, well, has happened many times
Clearly. Uhm.
well in the history, well then, it's not a question to say, ah, since it's a small party well there was no vote because it will not work a thing because it's
yes what can it really do, but clearly in this system here, really it is
clearly.
one or the other, right?
No, it's always Republicans and democrats, always.
yes, yes, yes. yes.
Or so
Um
and, and historically it's been like that, well many years ago there were other parties, but
uhm, uhm. uhm, uhm.
but for the least part, the past hundred years
Clearly.
have been lik that
Clearly, and it's far from breaking this dynamic, and furthermore
Uhm.
Well, with all the money that is necessary, no, to present yourself, and the campaigns, and
Uhm. Yes, and what do the people think in, in Spain, or what do you think, of, of the things that have happened here, with the elections
So close, and, and, counting the, the, the votes, all that mess?
Ah. yes, yes, well I, I remember about, when Bush won the first time.Really, people got very surprised, no, firstly the voting system is so complicated, no, with the little holes, and so and that
Uhm Uhm, Yes.
Really, there was so much, not so much confusion, in which
Um
It may be, well, the biggest democracy, and the most stable, but I don't know what
Sure, sure, is like the one
but
because in this country, we, the people rule, for other countries to keep watching the election, to keep it legal
Exactly, exactly, exactly
and, at the same time, our own election, is, such a complicated matter and so difficult to understand
yes, yes, yes.
And really, finally I don't know, this election, in the year
Two thousand
I mean, that was in the two thousand year
yes
That election, the thing was like, at the end, like almost a paid thing or something by
yes, it was, it was very strange, true that, true that
Through connections, because Bush, Bush's brother, eh, it was him
Uhm, Uhm
the governor of Florida like everything occur
yes
like it was ocurring in other place
now i was very surprise that al gore don't push more, not protested a little more because everything was so weird, so dark that
mmm yes
that i don't know, i was surprised that he retired so soon that i dont know well, i dont understand that
mmm
oh well
yes i also saw that, how he is going to say now
hmm yes and i supose that the things had been more different no if
mmm
but well yes
yes it had another history by now i mean
yes yes
you´ll imagine five years later
mmm
everything that have occur
and nothing the last ones too, it was sad, well i don't know i felt very sad because i thought that really it would have been a change no and the people
mmm i too, i too the last time was really
it would do
The first time, I felt much, much, much anger, I, like, like people really
Um, um, um, um.
Most voted for Gore, and still placed Bush, you felt anger, the second time, I felt sadness
um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, yes, yes, yes
Because people voted for Bush
yes, yes, yes, yes. Or rather, the second time is indisputable, or rather, um.
like, that were going, like they were going to vote for him again, after everything that had happened
um
I thought, what country is this, or rather, who were voting?
Uh, uh, yes, yes,
I don't know, I don't know
because, you can vote, here
Of course, well I voted, but
you, you vote or rather, you you are American citizen, I mean
yes,yes, yes, yes, I am a citizen. Or rather, I was born here
Of course, um, um. Um, Um. Okay, okay, okay.
For this reason, but I don't know, the system really needs to change, I believe
um, um, um
because, well, well, the government also has to change. But the voting system is very
um
it is very unjust because they go by state
Um, um. Um.
it shouldn't be like that, it should be the majority wins.
Ofcourse.
Point.
Ofcourse. yes, yes, yes
Well why go by state, that gives the small states a lot of power.
Um. Um, um, Um, um. Ofcourse. Ofcourse. Yes yes yes. At the very least, one good thing you have, is that there is only two mandates per President, no, well, at least the next time, well, he is worse than Bush but well I doubt it no?
Um, Um.
yes, there, that this is good because in Spain no no there is no limit
Um.
And I don't know if, it perpetuates during years and years and years
Ofcourse.
And well it is good that there is change of
Ofcourse. yes, yes, yes, I agree with that because every eight years, there is eight years, well it is plenty of time.
Ofcourse. no, even though eight, even though eight yes, there has been plenty yes yes yes
We'll see what happens the next time, I don't know.
Yes, is it known who will be the democratic candidate?
No, not yet. It is to early to tell because that
yes, yes, yes.
it will occur in the year 2000
in 2000, in the eight
eight, that is, the campaign will start with 2007, two more years
hm,hm.  Um, um.
Ah, but until now, no, no one knows
But I don't believe that Kerry will run again, right?
No
That is...
No, Kerry really wasn't a strong candidate.
Hm, hm.
Really, what the Democrats need is someone more charismatic, with more personality.
Hm.
with a really clear message for the people.
Hm, hm.  Hm, hm.
you see, I don't know how it was before, but these days, a politician needs to have a clear message for the people, because the people
Clearly, ok.
get confused easily, as if they don't put enough attention, they're not that interested.
Hm, hm.  Hm, hm.  Hm, hm.
So one needs to have a message like that, simple.
yes, yes.  Sometimes they stay with the most superficial, a little, no, and you start, well...
sure, people believe what they hear, but they only believe the simple and clear things
um, um
People don't want to listen to many explanations, too complicated things, they get lost
um, um , um
You have to say things in a very direct way, in a way that can be understood without many doubts
yes, yes, yes
And I think that maybe Kerry was too intelligent
Yes, he had some pedantic air, didn't he?sometimes being too smart
um, um
And maybe this. I saw him a couple of times he came to Philadelphia for a couple of meetings
um
And to me, his message..he said smart things, but he didn't reach the people, he didn't quite
um
have enough charisma
Yes, and Gore was even worse.Gore was so intellectual
um, yes
that people couldn't listen to him
ye, yes
they didn't understand him, they felt him so distant
um. Right, on the other side, it's not like he appears to be, like one more, another folk, I am just like you
Of course, like a neighbor. The man lives in the same block as me
yes, that's the role it plays. That in fact is not, because, well, his family is, well, he has a lot of money, and it's an start, I mean
Of course
That he is not one of us, but he is
Of course, I think that he is also real smart
Yes
And I think that he acts really stupid
Yes, yes, yes
To convince people that he is not dangerous
Mmmm
Like, he is like that
But is the exact opposite
I think he is smart, if he is not smart, at least the people in his government are smart
Mmm
Because they have done a lot of things, and it is not a coincidence, I mean
Yes, yes
It haven't being through all these things without a plan
Of course, of course
So
Mmm, and what do you think about Hillary Clinton, as a Candidate?
Ah, I like, ah, ah, I like, but I think it will be difficult.
yes?
Hello, my name is Wendy.

Oh, no, in those days, in those, no. They already have like 4 or 5 days where the topic is that same, of religion
Oh, yea probably, yes,

I think that it's okay

It's a bad topic
Uh, oh yes

No no, people that I've spoken to, they come, one comes from LA
No I believe in God, but I am not a fanatic of God, or
right
of religion.
right, yeah
But yeah well
yeah no
I can see how it could be a very uh, controversial topic, yes
Yeah, it's very controversial because people get
what?
let me tell you, they get really angry, that it's this, that not, that the
Oh really? to you?
good good, and that no,
Why? What pr-
Yes, because
Why? What do you think about religion that could make someone uh, so mad?
Well, for, for, for me it's that people, I mean everyone in the world they believe in their, in their religion, no. But there are different people,
there are different persons um, different parts of the world, like the Chinese, and the, the, the the Muslims the Buddhists, and the Catholics, the
Yes yes
there are different, you know because they don't have the same upbringings.
Oh yeah exactly, yes
Then right, so then who, who is one to say that the, the religion of one is better than the other.
I am more liberal, it's a word, liberal, in my beliefs of God.
Fine, but, but, it makes people very angry. You're attacking, you're attacking their religion, you know.
Yeah
It's ooh
Exactly yes
it's topic to talk about let me tell you
What's your religion?
Because Also I am Catholic, but you know I'm, I, I since I was very small I was um, my mother always took me to church. But now for, for eighteen years now, of that is, I got married, and I was married in, in the Catholic church.
Oh yes oh, really?
and, and, and everything, but for me it's you know are with so many problems that it had the, the, the hard
Hm mm
in the Catholic church, you know that is
Yes
with so much money, that one gives it so much money, that's hard you know, everyone works hard for their money
Exactly
So for, that is, of course in the, in the, for, for a donation for the church, so that the church helps the other people, the poor people
and it's helping one, one to the others, they help themselves because all the money that they're giving the families, so that they keep quiet,
Hm mm
you know that money you know
yes
and there were millions, millions of dollars.
E-oh, ri-right?
No.
It's a lot of money
yea, i mean, up here where we are up above, in how I li- I am, I live near Massachusetts.
Aja
and, and all the problems were in, in the church of Massachusetts, the church of Florida, the church of New York, there were lots of um, priests.
That were in, involved with young men.
Hm mmm
and, and, and well, for like thirty years, they knew th-the church knew about, about the, oh, priest, had problems, and, yes they had a problem
Hm mm
they paid the family, so they could stay quiet. You know and
Really?
Yea, and all that money came out from the collection fee. All the money came out of the church, and they were millions and millions of dollars.
Wow
Two hundred thousand, a hundred thousand,
How much, how much do they send?
you know
of, each person, like
It depends, I mean
twenty percent of their income?
um, including, the, the, the people that go to church?
Well, for example, I think that in certain religions, the Bible says that they have to donate around a twenty percent, I believe
No.
or, or, a ten percent of their income.
I'm sorry, of their income, I see. But
Like tides, yeah
Yeah, you tides, you do your, your tides, but the, the
Hm mm
Yes, yes they do that. And they verify it, it's like - WCW two let me see your, your, your, your, your, your, your paycheck.
Really? Wow
You know, you make, yeah, otherwise, you aren't allowed to go to church.
It's an invasion to their privacy!
Yeah, yes
Um
But, it's the same thing. I know the church that is here, but the church where I was, it's big now. People that go there
they have priests and you know, I mean, everybody has an envelop with their names on it and it's like, you only gave twenty dollars this week.
You have to give thirty-two dollars.  No, you earn, six hundred fifty dollars, minus taxes.
Yes
you have to give to the to the church, thirty and that, so much, you know and them, they wait, they expect it
Wow in, in the religion
Yes
in, the one I had raised,
Hm
ah, they don't do this.  They, ask for donations
Hm mm
for God but it is not something that is expected, yes.
Yes what you place, um, um yeah
My religion from my childhood, it is Lutheran
Aha
Lutheran, yes
Aha, Lutheran, OK
Yeha not now.  Now I just consider myself a Christian only.  I don't go to, to the church.  Only with my parents.

Very, I think that that to go, to to, the services of of the church it is very boring.  But I do believe in, I have
Ah, yes.
loyalty to God
Hm
Very um, strong, yes
Sure
But um no, I like to go to church
Hm, okay
Each week. I don't know how they can do it
Oh,
the Mormons. They go to church like - uh like, three, four days, or every day of the week.
Well, Yes, I, when I was young, when I -I went to a catholic school and went to church everyday
Yes wow
So but
I think that some catholic churches, are more um well no, don't order so, that they go so much, no. Like once a week.
Yes
It depends, I think about the church, or
Ah yeah Ah, but, I was going to ask, how old are you?
I am twenty six
Twenty six, okay, they you are still young. We have, I am forty years old,

More

Hm-mm, exactly.
You know, so, you prayed more, and and it was more for the individual, than for the church
Hm mm
So, these days it's more for the church than for the individual
Oh, yeah.
You know, uh, this is key you want to go to church so that you could help the church
Exactly.
You know instead of staying in business, rather than the other, rather than helping, and everybody goes back, you know, but, uh, sincerely,
the church is for the youth, or, you know, for the individual.
Hm mm
To help to you know to find direction, in your, in your life, you know
Yes
And, and they only want to help those, that, that give donations that help here, they want, um, food, they want time
Mm-hm

Yes
You know, um, also

I think so
for example yes they are going to have many advantages when they are here when they grow up and go to colege
Yes sure.
and for example it could be like what I do here I am a TA
yep
and I came from Colombia to this university to be a Spanish teacher's assistant
yes
in the same way
yes
you can go to a graduate school like the graduate studies
oh, yes
or the postgraduates and they pay for everything. Do you understand when they give you a teaching assistanceship?
yes
and they help, and if you speak Spanish you can teach Spanish and that way they will pay your masters
yes
and your doctorate is very good
and then you speak English very well right
no, I am only learning
no
and here my friends laugh at me, but
oh
well I laugh when I teach them Spanish so we are even

that is no is good eh they talk about well the topic today was religion
yes
was talking but was also reading and sometimes you can only talk about other things as well
yes, that is what they say
yes
but I don't know I think that maybe they have to  find someone that can really talk more or less because
yes, yes because I did send an email to the person in charge and he told me that he was going to find some native people
aha
so they can talk and tell the message
oh
which is very good, isn't it
yes, the other time there was a there is I don't recall that we had to talk, but I also did not understand anything
h
And my husband is Mexican too

mhm I've processed other things like that
no
I did well in Mixer

Oh hmm
and he told me and what what are they talking about or what?
