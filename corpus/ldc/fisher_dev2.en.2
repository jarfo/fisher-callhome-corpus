Hello, good af- good evening.
Good evening, this is Norma, from Atlanta.
Ah, well, look at that. I'm , from .
Ah, yes, ah, we- we're from near here.
Yes, we're very close. Is this the first call you've taken?
Yes, because yesterday, what happened was that when I had left, they called me, no, the ma- the computer called me, but I wasn't here, so I couldn't.
You couldn't answer.
Ah- and I carry a cell phone, they called me three times, but I was at the store, where I couldn't, you know, grab ten minutes to talk.
Sure.
But, where are you from?
I'm Peruvian. And you? Ah.
Puerto Rico.
Ah, from Puerto Rico, ah, okay.
Yes, yes.
Then-
Well, yes. Eh, they said we could talk about goal- marriage, or talk about whatever.
Yes, talk about anything, but we have to use the word marriage, I guess.
Ah, okay, well, we're already using it. Right? Are you married?
Yes, I'm married.
Ah, okay.
It's been eight years.
Oh, well, is very good.
And you?
No, no.
Oh, you are not married, oh, okay.
No, I was married, but not anymore. yes.
Oh, you're divorced. Oh, okay.
Well. And you've been many years here in Atlanta?
yes, ten- ten years already.
Oh Same as me. I've been here eleven years, I arrived here in ninety-four to go to the university.
Oh, I, I came in nighty-five.
Oh, okay.
by means of the temple. So, after, here, here I got married.
Well, you can say that, you can say that you are already from Atlanta, then.
yes. More or less.
More or less. But, do you return to, to, Peru every now and then?
No, since I came, I haven't returned.
Oh, okay.
I haven't returned. So,
It becomes hard. No?
Aha
That becomes difficult.  Sometimes, one gets involved in one's own life, and it becomes difficult to get to return to one's homeland to visit.
yes, be- and besides, also, that beside the, the money, when enough.  That is the problem, I think
Well, exactly. yes.  I know that, is to return, oh, a, a, a, the flight to Puerto Rico, is on sale, since it is not that expensive.  One can find it,
at least, two hundred, round trip
Oh, yes Oh
But, if it is not on sale, you are paying five hundred to six hundred per person
Oh, yes.  Is that, Puerto Rico is close.  Right?
yes, it is about three hours from here, flying
yes, it is close, so.  But, I have to go to Peru, it is South A-, in South American.  So that,
yes.  So, I imagine that in all of, then it is much more expensive.
Oh, yes.  It is more expensive.  It is c- it is very costly.
Do you have family over here?
No.  I came bec- through the temple, I belong to a religious organization.  SO, I came here through that.
Oh.
And, I suppose that we should talk more about marriage.  Right?
Well, they said that we could talk about any thing.  But, you know
Hmm.
If you want to talk about marriage, well, we could talk about any married couple.
Aha, okay.  What married couple are we going to talk about?  Let's see,
I don't know.  Mine lasted three years, and sincerely it was, it was because I married too, you know, too young.
Ah, okay.
And we did not have, well, you know, we had ideas that were not
and
compatible with each other.  And then, when we began real life, that,
yes.
that we said, well, no, we could not maintain the relationship
Ah, yes, then.  And you had children from your marriage, right?
No.
No, you didn't have children.  Ah.
No.
Well, at least, sure, that's one thing, its not a big burden.  If one has children, it is a bit more problematic.
No, and we couldn't, you know, we got divorced, but we maintained a friendship, although it's been years since I heard from him.  But, we left, you know,
Sure.
It was not something ugly, we did not split up with hatred, nothing like that.
sure
and I always wanted the best for him, but, it's simply that we made a, a mistake when at our age and our maturity and when in
we did that.
Sure.  Yes.  For me, fortunately, I am going to say, by the mercy of God, that I'm doing well in my marriage.
yes, thank God.
yes, we are there with the blessings. No, and
yeah, that means yu met you wife here, right?
yeah, yeah I met my wife in the temple where I was living at. In
in Atlanta.
She belongs to my religion, so, we got married there
um but. Is he from Peru aswell?
No, he is American.
oh ok, and do you have kids?
Yeah, I have two kids.
oh that's cute.
One is three and the other is seven
oh, god bless them.
oh that's great, thanks, you too, let's see if they find another husband.
I hope one day they do. But if not, you know I'm happy with my life.
let's see if theirs a second marriage.
yeah, let's see, yea because I said after that, I said that next time, I won't marry anyone until I know that,
and it doesn't go well with my heart, it's gonna be forever.
Oh
it doest matter what comes along, I can handle it and I can accept it.
mhm
So, we are going to see.
Yes, well, hope-hopefully, well, that I will find a good person. Right?
yes, that is the most important thing,
Mhm.
to want it and have faith.
yes. Let's see, What else should we talk about? What other marriage should we talk about?
I don't know. Well, you parents, Are they still in Peru?
Ah, yes, I was in Peru, my mother is en Peru. And, no, I don't have a father.
Ah, okay.
And my bro-my brothers, no, my brothers and my mother are there. And your family, where are they?
Ah. Well, my mother and father moved over here, after I moved.
Ah, okay. Then they are close by.
And, then, my, my brother also followed me here. And, all, now I have all my family here.
Mm. Good. Look, how, how nice.
yes. Mom lives near the airport. And, my father and my mother are, I think they will turn 30 and 50 years old this year, in December.
Ah,s-, Of marriage?
Of marriage, yes.
Ah, yes?
yes.
There they married, already, eternally.
yes, They met each other when, mommy is two years older than daddy, but they met when daddy was eight- whe- no, sorry, fourteen years old, and mommy was sixteen.
And, they became boyfriend and girlfriend almost immediately, and since then until now, they're together.
Oh, that's nice, look.
So, that's a positive marriage that we can talk about.
That is good indeed. Eh, yes, yes, it looks like, ah, before, no? older people, they didn't have like, the- mm, their marriages lasted longer, true?
yes.
Now there are many divorces.
yes. What happened with, well, you know, of course mommy loves daddy a lot, and that has a lot to do with it. But also, what happened with my mother, that she
Mm.
came from a poor family, a single mom,
Mhm. Aha.
and she never had anything that she c- could call, you know, hers.
Ah,OK.
And then, when she found dad. Y he was the lo- the love of her life, and she got married, well, she the had something, her family. It was,
you know, her belongings.
Aha.
And, she very much, because of that.
Ah, oh, she, there, was with him, there, bearing with everything, good and bad.
yes, Exactly. Exactly.
Ah, yes. Yes, that's what happens. yes, well- my mom, my mom when m- she became a widower, because my dad, no, died, then, she didn't, didn't get married again.
Ah.
She never, she never got married again. She's one of the older moms, right= She said, I won't, I was able to tolerate one but I won't do it again.
Not because, but, they also say, maybe, right? To, to me, we only have one soul-mate, one.
Aha.
You know, the one that is for you, another person.
yes. Aha
So, after you've been with that person, if something happens and that person leaves, you know, you don't need to look for anybody else because you should be satisfied that you had the one for a while
yes, that's true, well. We all have our own destiny.
yes.
Karma, we call it like that in the Vedic philosophy.
Ex-Exactly, karma.
Aha, do you know about karma?
Oh, yes.
Ah, that's great.
Oh, yes. It's important to know about those things because lots of people don't want to take responsibility for their actions, they think that
Mhm.
they won't pay for what they are doing.
Mhm.
And, that's not like that.
yes, that's true. No? Everyone does a, do a, every action has a reaction, if you do good deeds, you get positive reactions.
Exactly.
on the other hand, if you do negative things.  It's a way of understanding things. No? yes.
Exactly.
I mean, the suffering one goes through. No? It's all because of Karmic connections that one has. Mhm.
I have, I, I believe in, in karma for my own,
Mhm.
how do you say it? Because of my spiritual beliefs.
Ah, okay.
But, even if someone wants to believe in Karma, only, it's not scientific, if it is energy, energy never goes away, it's never destroyed.
Mhm.
So, if you create a positive energy, that energy has to go somewhere.
Mhm.
and then it will come back to you cause you created it.
yes, yes, that's true. Mhm.
And so, in a spiritual point of view, the way I see it, God created us so that we would live good lives. But, you are responsible for your actions.
Hello.
Hello.
Good night.
Good night, yes my, no, my name is Tami.
Ah, my name is  Norma, I'm speaking from Atlanta, Georgia.

Ah, still yes, yes, I every now and then, look at my kid's pictures and say Oh my God How much time has gone by?
yes, time goes by really fast, and you don't count your age and the kids grow.
yes, yes the other day he was mad with me because I still hadn't left and he, a man thought that he was my boyfriend.
Ah, yes?
Because people don't believe my age.
Aha.
So then he was mad saying I'm not his girlfriend, I'm not her boyfriend, that's my mom I see you and such small kids they should be happy that people think your mom looks younger.
well mad mad, but ultimately, what I've realized also is that people
yes.
Here it's very quick to, to divorce.
Ah, and yes, now yes.
Nobody wants to work for their marriage.
Yes, marriages, now the ones that really last are very rare.
Mhm.
No, now for anything, and problems, and right there they split like that
Mhm.
many times no
There is no patience.
they don't they don't tr-, they don't try to improve things in their marriage.
Your hus-, is your husband Latin?
No, he's American.
Mine is too.
Ah, yes, mine is dark-skinned, American.
Yes, that one you gave me. How?
Mine is dark-skinned, American.
Mine is white, I am the one with the dark skin.
Ah, I am the one here with the lighter skin
Ah
No, my husband is black, no, but he's really good.
Oh yes, My husband always thanks god for being from Panama and for me being send to Panama and also for meeting each other
Because American women, he said
Oh, now American women are really independend, because now they want to do no?
no, he doesn't like them he says. Not because for the independence, but for the lack of respect for marriage he says.
Ah?
That's what he says, but not because how i am, I'm really independent but
Yeah
I always take care of him
Yeah, of course, suddenly, they don't
You know, i don't give him
the don't appreciate that much like before no?, now it is different, all the mentality towards marriage has changed so much
Yes, is is so different, because mu husband now works with some boys
yeah
and they, his coworkers, they are Americans don't they?
Yeah
Women give them like 20 dollars every two weeks for lunches, everyone else stays with her, those are americnas. So they could , it makes me laugh, my husband has and xbox, so they come and play here at home
yes
and i laugh, because my husband calls and ask me if they can come over and play, they look like teenagers. If I said no he tells his coworkers that his wife did not give him permission, so I laugh
and you?, your wife lets you do whatever you want, the other ones have to aks. I laugh, and I said, listen
working all day, and only for an hour of relaxation, no
Ah, yes? that's cool, no?
Yes, and I laugh because when they go to lunches, to the, to my husband's job. I tell him, when you want to go, go, I don't care
He says, we can't go because this other guy didn't get permission, I say who didn't give him permission and he says the wife, he, he called her
Ah, yes? The husband is, the wife is who handles
Yes, totally
ah, yes?
I say no way for us
I think maybe we as Latin Americans are more used to, it's, it's a more patriarchal society, more patriarchal than anything else
Hmm
then we will always be, because of how we grew up, no? maybe we are more flexible
yes, that's what I, I imagine we are a little more flexible and they like tat, and if you, they're happy they're happy with you
Yeah
but with these women, I tell her, he's going to leave
Heh
because if she's got him on so tight a leash, that man is going to find someplace else
Sure, maybe that's why they split up, no, there are many divorces
Hmm, but no
Marriage doesn't last, one of the
they don't understand
of the factors
Mhm.I say no my husband, my, my children always laugh because punishment is that if we my husband and I, we do not yell in the house, plaster if that if anything I'm calling and eh
I have a loud, as I am on the second floor of the house
aha
my son says do not fight, I say I'm not fighting I'm screaming
Is that if you like as good latin, some many times is, they are get used, right? speak out
aha, exactly. and my son, I always say, and they tell me to be crying, man you want me to tell you when I'm screaming? I teach my pa-
so
ah
is, is that quite different
ah, yes, companies are different, although one does not, not I, but the principle does not, but really there are many differences, cultural differences, no?
yes, it is giving, giving so much laughter because my husband knows, co-, since I met him, um I did not know him as well dressed.
aha
then I always, I always wear clothes outside.
ah, you
in the morning, I say, I uh, I do not bother, I know how to put it out and give you work, work in, and I say good
it is the only that looks good at work, why you employ?
aha
I tell all those who go to pants with holes and women who do not see it anywhere and say my husband and I do not give work and dress well, they have with, problem with it?
y se echa a reirse, a mi no me importa, que, que dice estoy tranquila con mi mujer, me dice le digo bueno, pues ai, no, eh
Yes, yes, I also had one, or I have a friend who married an American and he says like that Latina women are different
Mm
yes, really, he, he appreciates it a lot, he says
And yes, it is that
No, because he, Latin women are too different no, no, they don't make, they don't make much trouble
No, and when we love, we love hard
ah, that's it, one is more loyal, I gues
Aha, that is true
You can tell, no? that we are more faithful, really
yes, but here
More, more, a lot more loyalty.
Mmm
Mmm
Not here, here he doesn't care he I have a, my husband's best friend's friend got married and in five years they were divorced and it was that prostitute and that
other women and what do I know, I say oh my God and we stuck in the middle because I was the wife's friend and my husband is best friends with him
Aha.
Oh my God, I told him, don't put me in the middle ay I what and, ay, I say this is bad.  Don't ask me what she said because I am not going to tell you.
But like that
Of course, it is very sad, no? that now marriages don't last long and really if they have children, the children suffer.
yes.  yes, I have one here, my next-door neighbor
yes.
Oh, she married a man and he already had a son who is  about eight years old, oh, eight years
I see.
and they had two and this woman, they were, to the boy in person
Oh yes?
don't touch my children. You are not my son and I don't know that, here, I say, I would like to grab this kid and take him here to my house
Oh, the poor children.
Because since I threw him out, sometimes, I tell you, the other day I told her, "you know that when I am in my house I don't want to hear your conversation about, about, when you're speaking dirty to your ex-husband and I don't know why you are speaking so loudly
and your kids, I say, your poor kids that are hearing all this, these bad things that you say to their father
Uh-huh. I see.
and say, "Oh, not me."
Yes, the children suffer. That's enough. They are traumatized when they are very young and they have all these problems, don't they? At home.
Uh-huh.
They're traumatized enough
And take out the husband from the house and put another boyfriend there
uh-huh.
I say, My God! Not even giving them time, from when the man had left there and already she had another.
You're right.
And also, how she shouts at the children, how she shouts at the children.
Oh yes, it's really sad, isn't it? Because of that there are many
I say
Many times the government take off the children to people like this when they're not taking along well when
Mm, yes this woman
no, they maltreat them psicologically or
do not work
or phisical-, or physically
yes, that's true, this woman do not work, the dad bought the house and give them money monthly
Mhm.
but his, I would think hey, if you get money monthly, hey do something, help other people or something, won't be into the house, I think that's why she is frustrated
Ah, yes, then
Because she do nothing and those kids misbehave so badm I say Oh God, I got to tell them off because they are by my side too, with these slingshot, and don't know what
Ah, yes? they fight hard?
ah ah, and me, with the husband, I didn't take along
Aha
I, He came to, shouting into my house, and I sent my husband, he kept staring at me, and he said, I never seen you this way, and I told him, well, when you bother a Latin american, and bother
Not me, it came to the end, and you hear it very well, he break laughing. Says I never seen you this way, and I tell him, well that's because I got tired off.

Yes, exactly, no, i don't have to dance, but i like to dance. It's like the music gets into my spirit. I, i like to dance, i like to dance.
Sure, because to cheer the children, you have to move, ¿right?
Yes, yes, exactly, although my friend does that without moving, let me tell you, she says to me "Gloria", you demand a lot of, er, energy
Right
why you they like to move the children, I say because tey remember me more that I move to what I feel you know.

yeah,yes
You love them yes I love them for example teach them something give them a lesson, like humor it is very important for children to

the children no
Sure yes or it many times when they utilize the music no.
yeah
is this way that people remembers the things that pass.
yeah
No, I, above all the kids and as they are forming. No, they have more memories, they have better memory, so.
aha um hu, um hu
Something like more stays in their minds.
And I was going to be a teacher, I took a teacher's course on, on music for little kids.
aha
to teach them, to see if they have a singing ability
um hu
so those we used many scarves, many eh little sticks, to see if they know, eh, a rhythm, you know if they know tu tu tu, tu tu tu
you now, if they can do that, you know so
um hu
But they didn't accept me, because I couldn't sing, you had to know how to sing and play an instrument.
hm hu
and I couldn't sing or play the instrument.
of-
now I'm going to learn how to play the guitar
Sure, music is part of the culture, every culture has its own music.
yes yes, yes
And they identify, with that mus- those people identify themselves each culture, no, with with a given music, for example Hispanic culture many
um hu
no, they identify with salsa, merengue, no, those active dances, that music.
Um, yes, yes
No, and many people like this, um,
Um, um, wait, wait Jeffi I'm talking this business, is my baby, I want him to be in charge of the games
And this, he's fourteen years old
Yes, he's fourteen, yes
Ah yes, him, I remember him.
If he htinks, if he thinks that he going to play a lot in the house now.  Now go to sleep.  And you?  Do you have a lot of music in your house?
Well yes, I have music.  My husband, he likes music the most, more than I do.
Okay
No, he really likes music, he plays the piano a little bit.
Oh, that's nice, I would like to learn to play the piano, I would like that.
Yes, and yes he, so he, we have a lot of devotional music like in our church.
Ah, ah,
And he's the one who learned to play the harmonica, the bridanga, and the cartal.
Ah,
We're also teaching all these things to our kids.
It's true that you were a hare krishna, right?
Yes, yeah,
Yes, yes, I knew that, OK
For this, the music is really important, above all in the churches
aha
No, music always gives a good message
aha
for the people, no, so that people remember. No, I look at it this way, even when I watch a television show
yes, yes, yes aha
No, I see that Christian people also have their music, that they sing, that they get quite emotional.
aha yes
And everything with music, that is, music really has a big influence in people's lives.
Yes and also music, they use, now they're making music for mathematics.
um hu
I mean, two plus two make four, four plus four make eight and many more, many more for mathematics, for
yes, um hu
to learn to write and spelling too, there is a song that if you can write this word. It teaches to sing it so that your remember the word.
um hu
there are many things out there, with music, everything is music. Because many kids, sometimes don't learn if it's not by talking. My son learned a lot with music
he learned the, the, the the times tables with music and I taught him like that, you know
um sure, yes because now, for example kids when here, in the abc, in the alphabet
aha
that is that famous song abcd
right yes, yes exactly
just now my little one who is three he is also there with his games, there he has a train game that we bought because it was his birthday a few days ago.
aha aha aha
then there he is, there with songs, the alphabet, then he there records it and he is recording himself there the song.
you know that I, for my older kid, my older kid I recorded the songs that I red to him in English
my brother recorded them for him in Spanish
um hu
then one day he heard them in Spanish, another day in English.
that way, it is good aha
in a journal, yes, yes and I had the book, then we bought the book in Spanish he followed the story in Spanish, it was good, good it was good, by brother said put it in Spanish too, not just in English.
because I, I read him many stories sometimes I was tired I, then I played a tape.  And he played by himself and heard the story
he didn't I didn't have to be reading the same story sixty and a thousand times.
um hu
because when you are young like that one has to read a lot.
ah yes, yes because children whey they are little they are like a little sponge, they learn everything
exactly, exactly
No, everything that is recorded in their mind, no like that is the best time to teach them.
exactly, yes
Better the good things, good habits.
yes, yes it is true, it is true, yes anyway how many minutes do we have, I am already tired, listen I worked so hard, oh my God.
a
And I also sing while at work, I can tell you that.
Sure, um hu.
I do, because that way I feel the time goes by quickly when I sing and I I don't let people that fight each other to get in my way
I'm always singing, yes, if you, they call me the "singing assistant" because I sing all the time.
yes, well, that cheers you up!
I have to sing, yes, yes, yes
Well, it depends, I  mean music too because there are certain types of music that I don't like, like rap, lots of young people listen to that
oh yes, yes, yes, they swear a lot
I don't like that type of music, it sucks!
it does, they swear a lot, I don't know how their mothers allow that! I once went to a party
aha
and there was a young girl there, I think she was around three years old, and they were playing that music, so I turned it off
um hu
and I said, hey, this is a children's party, I brought my music, I always have music with me and since I'm going to act as a clown, I'm going to put the music that I want, so I went there and played my music and the children started saying that my music was old people's music! I don't want that
Oh my God, yes, they say lots of bad words there.
they wanted to listen to that music, so I spoke with the mother and told her "how can you allow them to listen to that!"
all those bad words they are saying, and I said, that's terrible!
Sure, they learn them, kids speak of all those things, they speak of violence and all those things
yes, yes, ,yes, yes, yes
Stuff like that, heavy, it's bad for kids
yes
Exactly because of that, there are, not many, many children and they get into so many problems adolescents start to use arms and all that consequence of all that influence they have.
All the.
aha
Of all that music, of all that, all that they see on television and all the matter of violence
yes, it is true, the games, those games.
um hu, oh, those games too, those games.
that are so violent, my God.
yes
you know mothers and fathers buy them to get the kids out of, out of their sight.
um hu
but they are really bad because some are all day.  I have a nephew who goes into his room all day, to listen to music and to play those games, you don't see him.
You don't see him and he is fourteen years old.
Oh my God.  Of course, and children on top of that, also because of that many times they are influenced, no, the lack of activity, the children, there is a lot of child obesity.
yes, yes, yes, yes
No, that they are inactive, they are in front of the computer using their games or with the television.
aha, aha
No, because of that.  There are people, they are, not the children.
yes aha, it makes me sad for the children who are growing up now
yes the children always now are like more inactive.
yes, yes, yes, yes and less social because
um hu
when you are on the computer or when you are listening to music.
Of course.
You don't become social, you don't start talking to people or anything.
um hu
they don't want to see people,
Of course.  They isolate themselves
aha, yes, yes, yes mine the same, the same he doesn't like talking to people, I tell you that he has to be social.

Ah, ok, OK
It's pop music but it's not rock, he plays the guitar and writes songs

aha
that don't have a good message
That yes I know that there is a lot because a lot of the artists that sing songs and talk bad things and that happens a lot in northern music.
Oh yes
But what I don't like about the music is the rythm
Do you like the rythm of northern music

Hello?
Hello, good evening, this is Mildre speaking from Connecticut
I think I spoke to you before. This is Annie from Miami.
oh, yes, yea, yes we spoke
But
how are you? is everything okay?
yes, good and you?
Good thanks, the best.
eh. I do not remember the topic we were given last time.
I think we talked about marriage.
That was, that was, that you have
yeah
five children, right?
yeah, yeah, yeah,
yes.
Yeah
yes
Today is music
yes
Where are you from?
Well, well, born in Puerto Rico but moved to the United States when he was five or six years but my parents are Dominican
Oh.
I assume, I feel that I am
Dominican.
no, no, I'm Dominican Puerto Rican and I'm not because I spent every summer in Santo Domingo with my family but I forget my godmother
Aha.
I watched, was Puerto Rican, so, you know, I have of them.
Oh. yes, but I don't speak Dominican, you speak more
No. But, you know, it depends on how I get it.
Mhm.
And you?
I therefore am Puerto Rican and I like the salsa music.
Mhm.
I love dancing.
Mhm.
and I find that music makes us know the many countries, at least in Puerto Rico has many great eh, composers, writers and artists have
Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony
Mhm.
Gilberto Santa Rosa are known in many countries.
yes.
Oh, I think that the music, I love it, I put in on when I'm in the house, I dance I clean faster it cheers me up, it takes away the depressions
when I'm feeling sad
Mm. Mm.
or when I'm nostalgic about my country
yes.
I listen to the songs that sang, that my mom sang.
Mm.
And you, you like music?
I like it, I always listen to christian music
Oh.
eh but also, you know, since I have a little girl I'm trying to, to teach or we're going to teach her different types of music, so I always have her, listening to
eh, classic music or Latin music for kids
Mm.
eh, or, or in English eh, you know, the music that teaches the colors or the alphabet or something like that. And right now, in this stage of my life, I'm more
you know with kids music
Aha.
that let's say the music that I like more,
So, How old is the girl?
she is, she's twenty months.
Oh, okay, yes, that's a time for the music.
yeah and
they say that kids that, one raises with music, they relax and learn much more, and they are more intellegent.
i don't know if its true, but
i don't know, this night we wont to buy, and she was in the car, singing the song of the alphabet.
ha
you know, and my husband told me, shes a little too young for that, and i said, i don't know, but shes singing to you.
yeah, no, while kids, girl kids, have their best time
you know
i think what the do is, what they do since the moment the are born.
yeah
four or five years, something like that
yeah
so, then they forget a lot of things.
well, to me, everything
yeah
I've always forgotten things, you know, music for us is something like like, um um
you know, important, we don't watch a lot of tv.
oh
so what i mean, lets say, she learns about animals, what ever it is, about music, and the books we read.
oh, that's good, retarded kids also learn a lot with music.
Yes.
Because my son had a partner that had a kid with Down´s syndrome and
Aha
and she used to put him music and the kid was learning everything good and fast.
mhm, mhm
The fastest that he could learn
yes
and knew the songs from the memory.
Yes and that´s how she is, many times used to start, oh I don´t remember what song but we had a disc, the song was named(poorly written phrase)
my aunt Monica, or something like that
Aha
and she used to like to dance, when the people saw her dancing she was saying ulala, ulala, you know
aha
something like that, and today, probably she didn´t hear this song for 2 or three weeks and she started all day ulala, ulala and I thought OK I knew she was remembering the song
you know, but I like it because seeing how she was moving her legs and knees etc. you know, like that
aha, aha
we can do the dance parts too and she can learn the parts (of the songs) aha
and she´s exercising them, mhm
that´s how she´s learning how to know her body therefore
it helps her to know her body better and relax of course because the music is good.
And the language too. Because what we are doing you know, i, when my husband is not home, i talk only in Spanish
then when he arrives eh, completely, right, ninety percent in English some times, you know, i keep talking in Spanish because I'm used too, but
Aha, aha
that way she can grab both languages and that is the reason for having all the music with her, so she can be able to hear it in English and Spanish
I like it, i go many times to watch "salsa" concerts when there is one, other times
Aha
"merengue" concerts, i don't, really see lots of "merengue" ones lately. Then, i like most, really like the typical music, music of
how do you call it ? like saying from our field inward
"The full" and stuff like that
"the full", "the bomb", and all that and after when
Mhm
they do presentations in New York of "bomb and full", then we go there
Mhm
And we go see Olga Tañon's concerts too
Mhm
that, that has a lot of good music and the other guy who performs "salsa", the other, ay, my God, how it was, Victor Manuel
Mhm
I cannot lose their concerts, we always go
Then
here they do a lot of concerts and we always go
Hmm. And us, I prefer the, the merengue
Yeah
instead of salsa
yes, because if your family is more
but
Dominican, then I imagine they dance more to Dominican music
Uh, well, it's the same because my parents lived in Puerto Rico, I think it was twenty-something years before coming to the US, so
Oh, yes?
you know, it's not like we are a typical eh, typical family
Yeah
because they lived in Santo Domingo, so the revolution they had
Yeah, they left
they left and went to Puerto Rico, and from Puerto Rico they came to Miami
Oh, and now they stayed there
Yeah, so you know, they spent a long time in Puerto Rico, and that's why I say, I don't know which country I'm from, because I'm like
a mixture, you know, of both
Like a kid, in the same class as my girl, they asked where are you from and he said, I'm a mix salad, and they asked why, because my dad is
my dad is from this country, my mom is from another, my grandparents had a race mixture, he says I don't know what I am anymore
yes, I, I feel like that many times, because sometimes I don't feel, no, not comfortable, but you know, sometimes I don't feel very Puerto Rican
and I don't feel very dominican, it depends
Aha, aha,
so that but, you know, I, I like the the both cultures, and it's not so different, but you know, they have they have some eh
words that, that
I have taught all the typical music from my country to my daughters
Mhm.
I have taught them the dances, I have taught them the music and they well, no, they don't hear it so much, but they know how to dance it
yes.
and then, I used to belong here to a Puerto Rican parade group
Mhm.
and and we did dance presentations, I was in charge of teaching girls how to dance how to dance bomba, to dance plena
Mhm. That's nice.
to dance salsa
Mhm.
so my, my, my daughters know how to dance all that because they, they like music so much, all of them.
I
All of them love music.
I too, what, what I, the salsa, you know you know it's OK or whatever, but I think that of all kinds of music, I like typical music
yes, typical music is nicer, much nicer.
you know yes, and how not, yes, no, I don't know, I like it more and I like to see them dance, even more when people dance salsa or whatever.
I, I also like Peruvian music, I find it beautiful,
Mhm.
the music of the Chinese, India, cause I like it very much too, their music is, is beautiful I don´t understand what it says but
yes, but the sound it has, you know, like it, it relaxes you
yes.
and, now when I went to Puerto Rico I bought one of those discs that contains music of the water
Right.
of, of the trees, of
Mhm. oh, that´s nice.
Uh, when you want to relax, if you´re tense, you put that music and it sounds good, very beautiful.
Mhm.
It sounds pretty beautiful.
yes, that´s good. That too that, we- we do many times, that when, you know how to do it now, before, that call, we had arrived from, from shopping
not even five minutes and normally what we do is that uh, we turn on the radio and put one that you know, like a song whose music is middle
Right.
that´s it, nothing but music, no lyrics
yes, right, yes, with no message and nothing.
and that yes, that too h-, helps at least it helps me to be able to, you know, relax or whatever.
And you get with the one that you have to store and buy, store and
yes.
that´s why I say that music is so important for, well at least for me.
Mhm.
Because I was raised with all my family with music always.
Mhm.
My children my daughter is sixteen years old,so she is in the regueton cuestion and hip hop and that music.
yeah.
My daughters are already bigger and hear more American music
Yes
And
Yes
And myself, for example... I hear rock and roll and I listen and share with the the people but I cannot tolerate it for a long time
Yes
It puts my nerves in a bad state and makes me pretty agitated
Yes
So I don't like rock and roll, I hear it and I have young friends who have a band
Yes
And sometimes they invite me to go see them and I go and stay a little while with them bus after I say no, let's go let's go because my head is echoing
those sounds in my ears
I don't care about this music, and the lyrics really bother me, what they say
Yes, of the reggaeton now
Yes, that, I like that class of music put they don't say, and for this reason
I believe that the music from composers from before differs a lot from the music of today because they were dedicated to romantics things, the things with
Yes.
feeling the things that had moral values that sent you a message
Yes
Hello?
Hell, um, what is your name?
My name is Mercedes, and, and you?
Pilar
Ah, pleasure.
Pleasure, where do you con from?
Mm, I live in but I am Honduran.  Of origin.
And where do you say, do you say you live?
En
En oh, I don't know that
Mm.  It is to the west of the city of Philadelphia,
Ah, huh
past the following town is
Hm mm
And you?
I am from Spain, and I live, I live in New York.
Ah No, I thought they were only talking um, it was only people from the Philadelphia area.
No, no, it is, because I, for what I've seen, from all over Euro- from all over the United States, I have already talked with people from well that we had to, we have to talk about cell phones, no
Ah yes yes yes yes yes
What do you think about cell phones? Do you have one?
I do have a cell phone but the truth is that it is almost as if I didn't have it, because, I almost don't use it nor do I receive many calls.
yes, I do use it it is eh, really, really rare that I use it, and you?
I don't have one right now.  When I was in Europe, I had a phone,
Hm mm
but, here I don't have one because it is too expensive
yes
And I don't have, I have little money because I'm a student
Hm mm
and I have decided not to have a cell phone, but eh, that is not the only reason, also I have never liked cell phones that much.  I am not sure they are healthy.
yes ah, because, because, why
Because of the radiation they emit, no, haven't they had any studies?
hm mm
Proving that really they are not harmful.
Hm mm
And I don't want to use a phone throughout my whole life and twenty years later, they discover that it was bad for one's health
Hm, yes
and we all have brain cancer, or something like that.
Like almost everything, you start using technology, let's say like with teflon, they are doing the same right, that maybe, yes, yes
Of course and it is not known until later whether it was good or not.
yes
It's a shame, but
Yew, and, well, you have to drive, and you think about the ones who drive and talk at the same time
yes, and that's dangerous
Yes, that's terrible, and I agree
That's dangerous, there are too many accidents, well, now there are less, because people is using headsets, free hands, I don't know how they are called
Mmm
But many people still don use it, And when you're missing a hand, I don't know how can they drive
For someone like me, I think, it doesn't bother me, it's just that people don't have respect about their cellphone usage
Hm
Right?, I mean, they don't have manner in the way they use their
yes. because it's true sometimes, in the
cellphone
in the bus, people use their phones really loudly
Hmm
And that's rude, no
exactly
Because there is no need to talk that loud, you can talk a lot more quieter
Yes, but I think that most of it its people who don't respect, where they are calling from, people who is driving, but
well, that's the convenience, well, that's what are cellphones are supposed to be, they are a technology that makes communications easier in many
situations, for example, now, with the hurricane, it was the only way many people could talk with their family
yes, yes, well with, but, I believe that they used satellite phones.  The, the mobile phones didn't work well, because the but sometimes they did work, and yes.
yes, this is of course, because we have a friend who was in New Orleans, and we tried to call the cell phone, and yes, it, it was down the
the network
yes, sometimes, it worked, and sometimes it didn't
and it didn't work.  Hm mm
But well, it is, it is true that the advantages I see, it is that you can always be found.
Hm mm
if the battery does not run out if, for any reason they need you or need to talk with you,
Hm mm
they can always find you, and that is very good.
Hm mm, hm mm
And, and then well, eh, also, in cases of emergency,
Hm mm
you can call, if you are stuck on the road with a broken down card, and, or what do I know, something happens, you can call and ask
and ask for help, and that is good.  That's why when I have more money and I can pay for it, I'm going to get a mobile phone.  But what I'll do will be to use it with that earphone.
It is the, and what, but also let's say, they have the ones that are with a card.  True, there are some that use a card, that you just buy a card and use what is on the card.
Are those also here, in the United States also?
Mm, I, I believe they sell them at Walmat
Ah, well I will find out about that because, eh
with, yes, yes yes, because, they say there isn't, because, a problem is that you have to sign a real contract, and the contract is never less than one or two years.
Sure
I understand that i don't have to sign the contract, and i have a card to buy something that I'm going to use later.
Sure, because in the other contract you have to pay every month.
Hm mm
also very often the plans includes the calls, that's why they are more expensive
yes
In Europe i had a plan, i was paying basic service and i just had to pay additional calls, but if a call just a few,
it was very cheaper
Sure, yes, that's the problem we have now. My plan, as a say, it is almost a cellular one, but i hardly use it
Sure
At least we have acumulative minuts. But we acumulate so many minutes that we are not going to use them.
Hm
There is no chance for us to use them
Of course,
Anyway,there it is, they are accumulating. And let's say Europe has a cellular culture. Very similar to here in United States, or
Hm mm
Hm mm
the cell phone use depends of the countries, i have been living in Australia and there the eighty percent of the people use cell phones
I mean, a very few didn't have a cell phone like little kids or very old people who don't want to use them
Hm mm
Everybody around the world has a mobile phone. Will, I am in the United States since some time. I left for a while and came back about three years ago.
No, no body used to use a mobile phone and now everybody does.
Hmmmm.
The mobil phone has arrived here and it is the same as it was in Europe now.
There are the same problems in Europe as here people does not respect the places to use their cell phones.
Yes people talk very loud. In the subway, the bus, and that is not very polite to the ones standing around. There are people talking on the streets.
The phone is carried in the pocket and the headset is very small. It appears that people are talking alone.
That has happened to me, Because I have come to think that people are trying to talk to me.
Yes, I you think that they might be crazy.
Hm mm.
I got used to it, now it seems normal to me the only difference is that in Europe people text more than here.
There are short texts messages.
Hm Hm Hm
To send a message is much cheaper in Europe..
The calls are cheaper, but I don't know how much would a call can cost.
Hm mm
The minimum rate is per minute, on the other hand the messages cost twenty- five  cents per message.Every time you make a phone call you have to talk for more than a minute.
I agree because here that is not very common
Enton
In my country, we could say it is a little more common, but I believe that depends on the economical posivilities of the people.
Sure
My country there is not much money like here right.the people here, here it is twenty five cents, they are
that is not important of course.
exactly.
but there.well it was popular there among the students above all.
Hm mm
Because they are the fastest to write,because with writing with a phone is complicared because the only has new keys,all the letters
hm mm, hm mm. i could not
but, the, the students changed it into some type of game and ability, they even had contests to see who could type faster
and they would save a lot of money sending messages instead of, instead of, calling. they even have tactics some kind of language
hm mm
and, sure, if you call, and hang up, with out creating a hung up
hm mm
that it stays written whoever called you
okay
then the, the younge people use this to call, well to say, give signals, deci, when they call you, it is called a lost, that is called to make a lost
yea
when i make a lost, it calls me the lost, come down because I'm waiting for you downstairs, and sometimes only for demos- if i remember you, then
they call and hang up, and ya, and i remember you. instead of sending an email or simple, its a message from
hm
i remember you, i mean, that the people from Europe has a lot of imagination to save money, yes
Imagination. Many do, uh
a lot of cre- a lot of creativity
A lot of creativity, that's the word, yes. No, i, well, as i was saying, i would have to practice a lot to get some, but no, and, as i say, since i barely use it
Right, but
and to tell the truth, the only and what, the truth is that i do u- have it, but for emergencies mostly, and yes
some day my tire will get flat, the car
Of course, yes
i mostly, the truth is, uh huh
But that's very good
No
Uh, but if you use it more, seek combinations that you use it with the head- with the earphone, earplug, ¿what's it called?
yes yes yes
The headset, but that g- that goes far, so you don't get radiation.
yes, yes
just in case
I'm going to have to, to see if I buy one of them, because it is dangerous, right. And s- s- ah, that I, the only one that I speak to from my fam- family, is my husband, and he always that
and what
when he's driving, if he's driving he hangs up the phone. I don't want you to speak on the phone and driving.
Sure, sure
I mean, it's that almost never, the truth, few, ma- many few times
and have you heard about the phones of, of the next generation that already, that already are arriving?
It's, are those the ones that have, um, the, your credit card and all of that inside them, your information?
Ah, no, I
No
yes, I suppose that also, but I'm talking about the ones where you can even watch television
Ah
You can watch through Internet, you can check your email, that have everything now. It's like a mini computer, with and Internet connection, that's supposed to come one day, they've been preparing it for a long time, but it never arrives.
Aha aha
In Europe they have them, in some places they have them. In Austria they had them already, they had just come out last year.
Ah
I didn't see it, never I never used it because it was, it was more expensive, of course. But that, that would be very good.
Someone that had been in Norw- in Norway told me that the ones they had is co- ba- basically with the cell could do anything. Buy, eh, food from a vending machine
Hm
pay eh, the parking meter, like that, because it had your credit card information.
Ah, sure, and it communicated with, with the machine
Hello
Hello, hi, my name is Auria
How do you say your name?
Auria
Auria, hi I'm Nicole
Nicole, happy to meet you
nice to meet you, how are you?
good, good, and you?
good, where are you?
I am a little north of Atlanta
aha, what is the climate like there?
it's hot, but pretty good, and where are you?
eh, I am from New York
New York has
yes,
and I'm here in the city now
no, it's not cold, it's hot, so far it's been super humid, but but today is the first day that there hasn't been much moisture
and it more or less begins and cold autumn comes there?
eh, in October it usually starts, or it feels more like Autumn here, but the cold
okay
the real cold weather starts in December, in January starts snowing and then we have cold days until April, so
Oh, okay
swe still have a little bit
it's kind that way, but with the exceltion that here almost never snows, But the cold arrives at January and lasts until middle march
Mmm
Then Spring starts, and that isn't that long, it's like three or four weeks and then the heat
of course, it's the same here, Spring is really short, sometimes you don't even notice it
exactly
cold and then heat
yes
hey, and where are you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico
Puerto Rico?
yes, and you?
I was born her in New York, but my family is Cuban, and well, I also lived in Chile, so my Spanish is a combination of things
Oh well, I was also born here , in North Carolina, I was raised there and then i moved to Puerto Rico when I was 12 years old
Mm
That was when I learned Spanish
I see
I mean, speak Spanish, because i understood my Parents, they spoke to my in Spanish, but I always replied  English
sure I am the same, my parents always speak to me in english, but my grandparents, I was raised with my gransparents we all used to live with my grandparents
they would always speak to me in Spanish and I would answer in English and I started to talk at about fourteen
well same here more or less at fourteen also because at twelve i moved over there but i was almost thirteen
and i am reuse not me,i did not want to know anything about Spanish did not want to know about Puerto Rico I was very wild because they got me out
you know from my school my friends
sure sure at that age we feel it
sure you know after a year of not having friends because no one spoke spanish, well my mind changed
and where you live before you went to Puerto Rico?
North Carolina
Where? in North Carolina ya,ya
yes
em well and the issue the issue that I heard was by cell telephones i don't know because at different times i have had conversations when the other person hears something different.
exactly
but, I do not know what is your opinion on cell phones if they are annoying
well it depends on the courtesy of the person who uses it
um
is my opinion I do not think there should be laws how you suppose to use it or not
mm
simple I think that a person should have courtesy to know if you are at the movies you should not use if you are at a restaurant you should not use it
yes of course
But at least excuse yourself to go outside.
Yeah, yeah, obviously, the problem is that there are people who do not have that courtesy.
exactly
I have been in movies where the telephone rings in the restaurant, where the people have one- whether it is two people in a restaurant and one person is on the phone
or is, yes it's an urgent thing, obviously, but I don't get the urgency.
Yes.
It can't be a lot, so much urgency.
but to some if it was urgent you can say it with permission.
clearly.
I'll be back in then minutes, you leave, go outside, pick up the call and, and
clearly
and yes, but the people like you say don't have the courtesy.
um, yes.
The only law that I believe should exist is when you must guide.
um.
because I have seen the front a lot of accidents happen because the person in front of me was talking on the phone.
um.
Is on the highway, and because they are on the phone, they passed their stop, their exit, their escape.
um.
and then they do it like I said to turn, to get too their exit, and I saw the accidents happen because of that
um yes, yes, yes, I agree, absolutely, I mean, driving
at least it should use an ear bud or earpiece as they say
sure, but they should have their hands free, because you really need to have your hands free while driving, I see people
yes, when you are in the car
walking in the streets, not paying attention because they are talking on the phone, so, imagine what happens while driving, it's a lot worse, you should have your hands free, at least
to drive and also in hospitals, one really shouldn't use them in hospitals because the signals can interfere with the machines of the the hospitals.
yes
one should turn off the phone in other places, I mean, it's a matter of being respectful towards other people
exactly
and also, they should be respectful to the people you are with, because you are with friends, family and you answer the phone in the middle of a conversation, it should be on important matters only, it shouldn't be
when you are with a friend, and then answer the phone to talk to another friend, right?
or, it's like you are wasting the moment with the person you are with
sure, sure, and the phone, it's another thing that is supposed to help ease communication
exactly
but I think it makes it worse because you are constantly being interrupted by calls
I, I agree with you, I think that so much advancing technology, communication as you say, at the same time, we as a society have the habit of
pulling us out of the moment
sure, sure
you know, with the television, videos, what do I know, music
computers
well you don't live in the same moment and the phone sometimes well it distracts you from the moment too, and sometimes I answer the phone when I shouldn't.
if I'm playing with my little girl, she's four years old, she'll only be four for another year
um
you know, and I'll never be able to go back to that moment
right
while the person who's calling me, well I can talk with them, you know
but, I don't answer, I mean if I'm with another person, except for if it's something important, or if I know it's going to be a short call to decide something or other, but if I'm with someone I really, I don't answer the phone
well, I live alone so I have time when I'm alone, to talk on the phone, alone
exactly
and I, I think that when I'm with other people, I should be with that person I mean like it used to be when there were no cell phones when you talked on the phone in the house and not in the street
exactly
I mean I don't know, it's a little, it's like a mania that people have to always be available
exactly and you don't
I mean also with email i mean people have those blackberries and they're always available via email or to answer their emails and I don't understand how their email can be so urgent
that they can't answer them later when they're at home at the computer
yes that's true but it's that some people, like you say, it's like a mania or something, they always have to answer the phone when it rings
um
and it's a thing, even though they don't even talk for a minute, but they have to answer the phone right when it rings
um yea
but I don't, I don't answer when I'm in a time that I know that I can dedicate the time to talk with w person, but if I
I'm doing something, cooking or reading a book to tha baby, cause you know I let him dream
um um
and then I called him back, look mommy I'm sorry, or look dude, I'm sorry
Of course, of course that make sense, also now with the cellphones you can watch who is calling, so I don't know, I mean if I'm going to visit a friend
and my friend is calling, well I answer because I know we agree for tomorrow
Right
But if It is another person I can call him later, or I don't know, I mean It is about having common sense, but people think that is always. The other thing is that young people, I'm a teacher, young people
Love the cellphones, they always have them, and always ring on the classroom, I mean I don't know how many times they ring in my class
yes, I know
And I say, They are in the school not to answer the phone, but to learn
Right
also They are with all his friends, I don't know who is calling I mean You can imagine, they are in High School, But You can imagine most of
the young people in High School are their friends, are also in the same school
It supposed that yes
I mean because, this cellphones are calling, are the parents calling, I don't think so
no, the same but, aja mommy, mi mom is a teacher too and she has the same problems a lot
um, and What does She teach? your mom
She teachs Spanish in a High school too
Ok, Ok, I teach English English to immigrants
a, ~ESL
~ESL so
okay but my, my baby well she had bad luck with me, because she is going to say that I'm old-fashioned or that I know that she is not going to have a cell phone
at twelve or thirteen she is not going to walk up and down with a cell phone
no, twenty or thirty no, it's that many of my students already have it at seventeen, eighteen, they're old enough by then
oh yes but I, I have seen what was like twelve, thirteen, you know, they are entering seventh, eighth grade and it seems like they're already
they want to be older, so they put a lot of pressure on the parents and so the parents give it to them
um um
and I don't believe in this
yes, yes
when she's seventeen then I will but her a phone and since
yes
and this to ca- call me
and you have only this daughter?
yes, only her, I am a single mother
already
and well, she's the only one I have for now
but good, she is taken care of well
If it's the same as those playstations and all that, I say no, no, no
Hello!, My name is Gloria
Good evening, How are you?, I`m Norma from here, Atlanta,
Oh!, Fine, and you?
We meet again, doesn´t we?
aha, last night I talked with another lady, a lady that dreamed as you, but she was from Philadelphia.
aha
Her name was Silvia and we talked about the same thing, we talked about the cell phone.
Ah, yes.
yes
mhm
And you remember the cell phone number?
How do you say?
We have to talk about the cell phone
yes, yes
From the cell phones
aha
And, do you like it?
Well,
Do you agree with people who drive and talk on the phone?
ah, well nope, I don´t agree with people driving and talking on the phone, it it dangerous, they should not get distracted, they can receive bad news
what do I know they are in shock and go to,what do I know,there are accidents for that
yeah
No but or is in another part, another part the cellulars have became a necessity. Not for an emergency, for something that happens, and many times we can not find a telephone
close well at least they have a cellphone.
yeah,yeah
And you what do you think?
I do not like it I do not talk and drive I. I absolutely scream at people that drive and talk on the phone. makes me crazy
yeah
because they do not put attention, they are they are on the phone and are not putting attention yes yes he ate the light or did not eat the light,o
yeah
o,o he's arguing . One time I was with my friend and her husband was arguing with her and I told her : hold on hold on that you are going to put me you are going to kill me because you are arguing with him.
yeah
And at times today children are using at school.we need to take away,It is an annoyance in school,the cellphones:They lose them,we need to look for them
we need to dial them,they go crazy,like if it was their last bill on their wallet. Ah and some times they do not respect do not respect their teachers
the teachers tell them,to turn them off, and they do not turn off they leave on vibrate, it is childish, very bad childish expecially at school
all this children,and they lose it,they lose it we collect like, twenty or twenty five cellphones even though we tell them not to bring to school
They still bring them,
sure
They still bring them,
Sure that does not, should not be, or I agree if it is an emergency no?
Exactly
And there isn't, but when is something, for example, Why do children need cell phones in school?
Exactly
No, they go to study at school, they don't go to talk to their friends, they go to study
Yes
No, and when you're driving, it's really dangerous being, you know, driving and talking with your cell phone
Exactly
Yes, it's good, because, how do they say?, they are not paying attention. No, but in other ways it's like convenient, isn't it?, but it has it's cons and pros.
Yeah, right. You know, someday I spoke to other mom and I told her: You know, you should not send him with his cell phone
Oh, but that;s the way i communicate with him. And I told her: he can use the office phone whenever he wants.
Yes, it is an emergency, you call here and we look for him.
Of course
She told me: No, but, do you think that i bought that cell phone to be in the top of a dressing table?. But I told her: Look
then I will tell the principal to start taking it away from him because one of the school rules is not to bring
not to bring the cell phone, and you're sending him with a cell phone, you are guilty of the corrections, and even that you don't correct him, you should correct him well
really well, that way they won't do it again
Of course, Parents are the one who should educate their children, How does people says?,Education starts at home, no?
Oh, yeah, yeah
Parents don't educate their own children, they don't teach them good things and manners
Yeah
or do things that are really appropriate then
aha
neither the children don't go, they won't learn, they won't understand
Exactly, yeah
hmm
Ehm, let me see what else, I am so tir- tired, I had two parties this weekend and I am dead tir-ed, and and leave me and you, that is a
I am going to tell you, yesterday I had a party
hmm
and, and she called me that I would come later, really, then I could not find the place, she would continue calling she called me no, I am going to tell you about fifteen
times in less than three minues,
Oh, my God
and I let the cell phone ring, I said: I am not going to let this, this woman that is causing me to me, an accident
aha
so that I would get to her light quickly. And anyway I was close to her house.  And she told me to go to the other side
Oh, yes
yes after I was two blocks from her house.  He told me no it is on the other side, and after that I come another time I say: I am not going to pay attention to her
I am going by the directions the directions that I have on the Internet
aha
And I arrive very well, I say the next time I won't even call her.  Because she was driving me crazy with the damn cell phone
oh, yes, yes people nowadays
Oh, My God
Many times they are adicted to the cell phone
yes, yes, yes
Ah, despite nothing happens, they get their cell phone to look, to search for someone to talk to
yes, yes, it is true. My husband, my husband says: ay always, I am not going to buy you that new cell phone because you always leave it here
what are you thinking?, you must carry it with you as if it were your wallet, And I say: I am not carrying it as if it were my wallet because
Me my, my child is the most important thing for me and he is at school, And if something happens to him there, they call me,
that's right
and if something happens to you, the ambulance calls me, for what reason do I have to carry the cell phone if, when we saw an accident one time on the highway
you know, then it was handy,
That's right for certain, as I say emergencies ¿isn't it?
yes, yes, yes
really, eh many times one does not need, but many times there are things that one really does not need, for instance, there were no cells before, cell phones that one
some years ago there weren't any cell phones, there wasn't Internet or something
I know true,
And there one lived well, you really did not lack anything
exactly
It is not, yes, as we live in a society with consumerism that is the reason
yes
many times the advertising all that blurb, I don't know
right
They make us think that we really need something that we don't, we really don't need them
yes, yes exactly, and how they do, the lpo is another thing
mhm
That every boy has to have that music,noise in the airs and all that. Oh my god and, in the movies, even in the cinema, he said that we have to talk that
that they use it in the cinema; in the cinema they also make a lot of noise and they ruin the movie when you go to the cinema.
Ya, I don't go, I am tired of hearing all the world talk in their cellphones, in the cinema, they are in the train too, in the train like
its their home,
ah, yes in the train
One hears all the conversation of the , the one that is close to you, or in front of you.
I don't like it, there I don't like my cellphone I put it in vibrate and whoever calls me has to wait until I
leave the train I am very obsessive, my friends say: Hey, gloria, what is up with you: look you go the highway
You are going at fifty and you are talking I don't think you can you are losing pendent, to the conversation I find it very rare because when I
I don't get on the Highway but when I do I have to put it in my head that I can't be talking with someone.
In the phone oh! My god it drives me crazy, the phone, that cellphone makes me crazy.
Of course, know pretty much everyone has a cellphone. Everybody goes with, with their
I know
cellphone talking, talking, there from there
I know I know I don't let my boy take it to school, he has it for emergencies.
No,
Then he/she says to me: "Mom, but what if there's an emergency?", and i tell him/her: "You go and since i work at a school they'll let you call me".
They know you're my son
Uh um.
They'll let you call me. You know, but we restrict the phone to everyone so the cell-phones won't be used and still
They don't listen, and you tell them not to use them, and they're on the hallway, they go into the bathroom
Oh, yes
At the hallway, they go behind the door, oh, these kids now are horrible, horrible. ¡Oh my God!, horrible. Even in church, today at church a poor lady
Of course, it's a kid, right
Her cellphone rang like it was a door bell. And even the priest stopped when he was praying and said: "¿what's that, a door?
And he said it like a joke.
Oh, of course.
And he did it like a joke, but then he said that when you go to church is to pray, not to ask for your cellphone ringing
So, she felt bad and she went outside. And afterwords, when she left her cellphone started ringing again, and, and everybody, everybody started to laugh
because this lady was, i said aw, leave already, interrupting the concentration that you have at church. You know, so
Of course, yes, when we go to the temple, our temple, there too
Right
No, there's, er, people that have their cellphone and before the mass starts, the reverend says "please turn off your cellphone" so they won't interrupt.
Right, and people still doesn't turn it off, ¿right?
Yes, some turn it off, ¿right?, but some don't, they still
Some of them turn it off
They  have and sometimes sound, right?
I know what a lack of respect, right?
Oh, yes, really
Just ike adults do not pay attention, so it is that children do no pay attention neither.
mm
Because they follow the role of their mom and dad you know, I'm so tired, now I, I am helping my baby with his job.
Oh, okay
We are writing, he has to write eight sentences about cell phones as to why he has a cell phone and if he can live without a cell phone and if he you can use it in the cinema.
if you can use it when you go to a dance, if this, If it is also used to play now I use the cell phone as a calculator
Oh, yeah
Because I can use it as a calculator. And, and oh the other good thing it has, I  put my appointments in my cell.
Oh, this can be true
yes, the only bad thing with that is if I do not find the phone until after I forget the homework, and I put that so when I remember that
today I have an appointment. In this case it is good, yes.
Yes, in a few things, right? That's  good, right?
yes I'm with the
but there is too much of an addiction
I know
Yes really,
anyway I keep talking and I'm tired. Oh my god, have you called a lot? Have you received a lot of calls? Or have you called or do they always call you?
Okay every day Okay they call me, I haven't made calls.
Oh, because you you can make them too, you know?
yes, I too, I know but I no, I
aha
I don't, they call me everyday because, it's a limited amount of calls that you can make
Exactly
You can only do twenty five calls, that's it
And, can't you make the twenty five calls, do they always have to call you, can't you call yourself?
I, I guess, I don't know, because to me, yes
Oh,
they always call me, everyday, since the study started
Oh, they call you everyday, oh, I'm glad
yes, they call me everyday.
Oh, I'm glad, I'm glad
And one day, they did, I don't know, about two calls
Oh, me too
Well, yesterday, no, not yesterday, one Friday I lost a call because I, they called me but I wasn't here
aha
here, and they didn't call back
yes, I lost, I lost a few too, but I told them I was in certain days and sometimes I'm not, sometimes I'm
mhm
the answer machine is on and they leave a message for me there, I lost the call, and they sometimes call again and sometimes they don't
I tell them that I'm here late, around eleven o'clock. So, they call me late, sometimes, they call in the evening
Hello, who am I speaking to?
Hello, good night, I am Lorena.
It's a pleasure Lorena, you are speaking to Lina.
Paulina, how are you?
Fine do you know I didn't list what the topic was.
I was going to ask you the same because I can't listen well. I think it was clear, loud I understood from the Internet.
Oh, something about the Interenet is going on. The thing is my husband was.
of the
Pushing the button and told me it was my turn and I didn't listen anything.
No but it was clear that I was paying attention.
Si, no he has a very strong accent
and you couldn;t really listen.
yes
this and of all the points he was making before I picked up the call, the last thing I understood were the advantages.
Yes.
I understan which are the most important dates in his life and which aren't.
Yes.
what are the advantages and disadvantages?
and disadvantages of using the internet?
of using interent and at the end it says his opinion and talks about meeting new people thought this means.

that's good
yes, in Mexico City when my husband was studying for his masters
ah yes
there was th-, since it was the Latin American Academy of Social Sciences
aha, sure
there were students from all latinareis and then well, there were always times that we were invited by eh a Chilean friend, an Argentinean friend to eat some of their dishes, no?
sure, I can imagine
all those pastries, wow, how to forget them
yeah, Mexican food is really famous
yes, yes, yes, yes and where are you calling from?
From Athens, Georgia
Georgia, I'm in San Antonio, Texas
yes, I live in Athens, oh, right, well
How long have you been here?
in the United States? I've been in Georgia for two years but I've lived in the United States for around eleven years
yes, eleven years, and how, just two years
and you, now, it's not right, it's right
yes, well, when you first got here, did you came to study or how
yes, I came here when I was eighteen years old, I had just finished junior high, right?
mhm.
in Chile we said it's middle education but well, I finished it and then I came to live here with my family for a year and then I applied for the university and
I started studying here and I stayed
ah, that's good, that's nice, right?
yes, so, you've been here for two years
aha, two years because we were waiting for our kids to finish their middle education too

I'm sure washing dishes - and listening.
Yes, listening is a good way to use the time.
The time, yes.
So, how many people have you met in this way?
I know you got in touch the other day because of the other callers, but there was no call.
The same thing happened to me several times..two or three.
yep.
The call connects or it doesn't connect.
It rings and has the "pip" and then no one answers on the other side.
Yes, if nobody is on the other side, exactly.
If so, I've talked to a lady who was married to a Mexican man and she was not North American.
Oh, right
Oh
Yeah, but this is interesting, ¿right?, i mean, i didn't understand the
Yeah
at first, and now that i have been talking, it's really
Well, it
you recover the importance of speaking, ¿right?
Yes
Because in this life, with so much hurry, and with all those racing and occupations, well, sometimes you don't even call yous friends on the phone to say hi or to see how they're doing, ¿right?
There's no time, yes
But then you have to value what's important
and you can also get to know people
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
A little bit more
But spending a few minutes washing the dishes, for example, to call over the phone it's always kind of, it's important
Yeah, make good use of time, right?
Right, right
Now that the kids are in bed
Yes
Well, one, the other must be laid down, he's hanging around over there
aha
yes it is important
yes and this internet well yes that is another question but well it is a wonder
do you use it a lot
ey, not me but my children, especially the youngest girl she is always on it
yes
and the most important thing is that computers are a wonder, no?
yes, but
like they make information access easier
ah information
and the poor paper encyclopedias well they are now decoration articles
yes it is good to always have them handy but
yes yes yes they are very pretty
yes and internet can be very useful and also can be very bad because as you said good and bad information also no?
bad information, no? everything that is known about about
oh about pornography and all that yes
exactly what a terrible thing, no? yes yes yes yes
yes so you have to be wise but
yes
but it is incredible to communicate with somebody or learn anything
yes or somebody in Chile could send you an email or something like that, right?
yes
also those parents
and like you said the encyclopedias, you can have access to so many things
yes yes yes you get in and you put this cooking recipe to a medication, to a natural remedy.
yes
to microbiology, physics, whatever there is is, right?
it's true and more over now that I am here I never cooked a lot when I was younger
yes okay
and now it's like I get a recipe for emapanadas and whatever you go to get one and and get recipes
aha, sure and they turn out easy, right? and and I remember that
yes
yeah that the other day for the pumpkin pie, right? Around Halloween time?
yes
No man, well there was like thirty five different recipes
yes
well choose one and prepare it.
and prepping and a prepping
yes, and how is it?
and the other, was saying that he was going to meet somebody over the telephone or the internet
yes, no, through this medium we have been meeting, the phone calls and everything
oh ah yes we already talked about that, no?
aha, well yes I have really liked, the truth it has been novel to me, it's incredible
yes
that well that they are like introducing again that the phone is useful and it's important, no?
yes
to speak to people
how did you learn about the project?
my daughter at the University of Pennsylvania
oh you should is from that university, no?
yes, you too
eh no, my husband kn-. He took part in another project that they had last year
aha
so this year they sent him and email and told him we're doing this project
ah OK
and if you are ahh if your native language is Spanish you can take part so he sent it to me and told me well, he is North American and he told me well, but he speaks very well
but he told me I'm not native so you go, you take part
that was good, listen, speaking about that
and I sent it to him, ah
the other day I had to speak to a man that lives in New York but that his parents are Puerto Rican
yeah
its so hard to understand, i don't have a problem with you, you're talking to me and like they dont say words or letters properly.
very fast
and they talk to fast, and when i work, they say sir, you should start calling, right?
hey yeah but he has
no, i mean the one from the plan
yeah i just talked to them, i gave them my comment, i told them they have to atleast,
to talk to someone the knows Spanish
writing correctly, because while hes reading, you can say something before time runs up.
yes
oh the time goes up
yes
time is up and I say that it doesn't go with
no yes yes yes or for example when they say wait on the line
yes
it's like saying I already forgot, for now hold on
you don't mix the two of the and you can't understand it that way
yes yes yes yes
no, I also complained and told them no you must read it again and
well, it's good that you said that, I haven't said it, I've only thought about it
and change the what oh no I I told them and and the one the one that's in charge of the project called me at home and told me is it that bad
that they are trying to find someone that speaks Spanish and they will see whether they can make the recording
no yes yes it's yes, yes
yes, because you can't understand it, once I had to listen to it twice
sure
because I didn't understand what they were saying about going and I don't know what else
yes, me neither and finally I I underst-, I don't understand that word
you press any number because you don't
I I press the four because I understand that it's a, no? that it's a phone without a wire, a wireless
aha,
I hope that's it, if not well at the end I passed the test approved and they pa-, they tell me ant then listen and do you have much family in Chile, all your family members
Hello?
good night, my name is, i live in Connecticut
This is Annie, in Miami, we talked
Oh, Miami, ah, Ah and how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine, thanks, And the baby? Sleeping?

Yes, now i put it to sleep
Oh, that's good
and how are you?
I was watching a program on TV, the program that I like to watch on Wednesday's
Ay, that's good, I'm starting to feel a cold, i have a sore throat, very bad
Oh, me too, from the allergy, but apart from that, well, I have taken vitamins, to calm
that's what it says, but I'm pregnant, and i can not take many things
Oh
So, i'm, you know. Im not feeling well today
No
But
Ah
anyway, I n-
The conversation is about the internet You use it, internet?
this is like , I use it every day. There, we, eh, you know,we have e-mail, we have, eh, eh, we to all that we have todo with the bank,
I search for information, recipes, go to thelibrary.
Mhm.
I don't buy much, but, if I go to buy something, I always do eh, a research.
Aha, aha.
Eh, searching for products, to see where I get the best price. So, the internet, for us is, is, is like, you know, having an
encyclopedia, we say
Mhm.
at home.
yes, it is good. A m - I use it to look for work, to searchfor information, for the school girl. But, for
things, to search for people on the internet, I don't like it.
No, a m- neither do I.
I don't believe in, in that of- I believe that you meet, there are many crazy, a lot of, a lot of trash such that, that put you on the internet, and
There are many people who have used it, and, and have married and all. But I, I have never gotten a,
Because, I
in the chat rooms those who say.
yes. eh, and,
I have never talked with anyone.
I, before, eh , get into the, the chat rooms. But, they were not, you know, to meet people, or whatever, they were about different topics
But, no, it was nothing, eh, you know, after some time, doesn't like me. Because the people were like p- n- i don't know, they said things that
that l-
It wasn't true
si, or, or things that usually don't say, you know, as it get ugly
Yeah, yeah, yeah
and i didn't like at all. So, after some time, like one or two months, i stop going. But, because i prefer talk with the people, no, you know
be there a- in, in front of a machine
Yeah, yeah
But, you know, i have one
And, that tra- that, also that has bring a lot of troubles to couples, i found
yes.
Because, it break apart a lot of couples that husbands get into, or the woman get into the internet and meet people and they, they spend hours, and hours, and hours, and hours lost in it, in this internet
I don't, i use it like that, but, my niece sends me pranks, and sends me jokes from Puerto Rico, and, and, mi son sends me the pictures of the baby girl, the new baby girl, that's why i like very much the service.
Because, i can see my granddaughter at any time and, and know how is she every month
yes, is- that is something that we also do. We take pictures of the girl, and we send them to all the friends, our friends, and every, well, not every month now, but before, was every month
Yeah, yeah
And, that's what like very much because, in that way, at least the people that we know, the family that is far from us, can see how is she growing up
yes that's is, that is something that we do a lot, i forgot the pictures.
yes, the pictures are , is, is something beautiful. But, also, eh, what i don't like too much, they were saying that, you know that you send your pictures and they keep them in something like a
file, for some times, so, after, after that, I think after six months or something like that, the, they delete them, the, the
the program deletes them if you haven't taken them out yet.
Well, my kid is almost two years old now and we've never, we've never gone through that, the pictures are still there. I think it depends, you know
in what you are using. We have pictures in the Internet, we have some from my baby shower.
Oh, well, when, I don't, I usually don't leave them in the computer, I place them on a CD.
Ah, very smart, aha.
and I date it and we put a label in it and I keep them like that. If some relatives show up, then we play them on the television or in the computer.
Ah, that's great, that's a good idea.
Aha, aha, yes, because, if you leave them in the computer, they take up a lot of space, I believe.
Well, I always have them copied before, before I upload them to the computer.
Aha.
Oh, I'm sorry, in the Internet, I always get a copy in a CD and all that stuff.
Mhm
So, that's how, I have the originals that we took. We take around one hundred every month.
Aha.
But, I upload lets, say, around thirty or forty. So, I keep the originals and the ones that I uploaded to the Internet because those are the ones that,
you know, I've fixed, the better ones. So, I always have two types of CDs. So, yes, when she grows up if she wants to have the pictures I can put them on and say, look these are the best ones and these are the original ones, pick the ones you like.
Aha. Yeah
So she will have them. But,
yes.
I had never thought about playing it on the, the television.
yes, you can, ca- but, you have to, I think, to to program the CD for whatever, to watch it on the TV. So, you buy a cable, I think for the camera, and
yes.
and you have it, it on the te- on the television. That's what we do. Every time we have a party, well, we play it
on the CD. Afterwards, when our family comes by, we pla- we get together, and everyone seats on the living room and they, they watch it, eh, on television it looks better
Mhm, eh, eh, yes, that's a good idea.
because it's a bigger screen too. And, if you add music,
yes.
well, it, it looks nice. That's why I like the, the Internet, but for the other ones of, of a couple, it doesn't take.
Me, me neither. And, and that too, like you said before, that, you know, you never know who you're going to meet.
No, but, look at all those kids that sometimes they take, that is, that, that they meet those crazy people on the Internet.
yes.
He- here there was a girl that is, that a guy fooled, and, no, from New Jersey, ah, that he was about forty something years old, and how old was the girl? she was fifteen,
and he took her. Good luck that they could catch her. But, God knows if he had taken her and killed her. And, I don't like much either for the thing about the kids, sometimes.
Me neither, yes, that's something else that, that I already know, that when, you know, my son is more, more, let's say older, that the computer will,
I, I will have to move it from the room that it's in. Because, right now we have it in a, not in the office, but, let's say, that's what we're calling it.
And,
It's a separate room that you use as an office.
Yes. But I want to put it, let's say, in the living room or, you know, in a place where they can, can use it, and I can see
everything that they are doing. Because, since I used to be a teacher, I know, you know, what, what, what kids do,
Mhm, mhm.
how they hide from their parents and things like that, and not tha-
yeah
I don't want to say that my s-
yes, they when you go, they change the screen. What do you do? well, my grandchildren sometimes I tell them, what are you doing? no, nothing, here.
yes, it-
And I open the other screen that they have there, to see.
So that,
But you need to be very vigilant because the computer is a bit, it has many advantages but also some disadvantages.
Ah,
Because, look at all this information that it sometimes provides so that these, these terrorists make bombs. Even these students that, that killed those people at Columbine School.
yes.
They took their ideas from the I- the Internet. So, sometimes, I mean, it has its, its good side, like everything. Like all the things that they come up with, that have some good points, and then, it has other points that, well,
are disastrous as well.
It all depends how you use it. You know? yes that, but, no, I, I, I love the Internet, but, I also know when,
you know, if one starts to, n- no if one starts, but, when kids start using it, you have to do it a bit differently.
Aha, aha.
you know. Because, I believe that many times, they don't,
yes, no, now, well, now they have invented many things of parental control and all that stuff that,
yes.
That, at leas, you, well, you can control them with that a little bit more than before, But, at first, when there was none of that, well, you know, the little boys went into the chat rooms, uh, they opened twenty thousand stuff.
And, well, and that still, it happens, even if it has parental controls. Because, many times, when i go to, to look my e-mail, you know, i know that this happened to, to some of my students, that they go to open their e-mail
And there are pictures of, you know, of, of naked women, or whatever.
Um
And, and that's something that, that upsets me very much, that i don't know how can you change that. ¿Do you know?
Oh, it's that, there's people that, uh, when, i think that if you leave the, the password, and you don't close the, when you go to see your email.
If you don't close it right, quickly, oh, let's suppose you, you go to cook or something, and you leave it there, in open space
a lot of, there are a lot of men that, a lot of people that know hoy to get your, get your password from that moment when you're leaving it for, for a long time, that's why it tells you that as soon
as you're leaving the computer, well, you go and close it. ¿You understand?, to ensure that no one will get your information. Well, so, what they do, when they got your password, they come and they start sending
these, e-mails that, that sometimes, what they bring is viruses, sometimes it's dirty stuff.
Right.
So, it all depends on, i mean, at least you should be very careful with the, with the passwords, and with information, specially the bank and all that
sometimes when they ask for information, that, they ask you to put your PIN again because
Yeah
you have to be very careful there.
No, thank God we, you know, stuff like that on the computer, it hasn't happened to us. But someone did steal the, the number of, of
social security
Right
Of my husband a while back, and we had a lot of trouble.
Oh, yeah, well, that's identity theft. Well, that's been happening a lot in
Why,
in the middle of the internet they rob everything, your, your, your personality. That is why, when, you know that sometimes, they tell you to grab, what do I know? what is free, what, they offer twenty million things free in the internet. And, you know you'll start to fill them out. And then,
when they start asking your information like, like that last name of your mother, date of birth and all those things, well, it's not good to give that information.
Hello good evening
Hello, good evening uh, I'm Nicole, I'm calling from New York
Oh I'm Norma here from Atlanta, Georgia
Hello how are you?
Fine and you?
Good, good did we talk before, or no
um, I don't know
No, no, I spoke with someone from Atlanta
uh huh, yes
But, I don't know
mhm
What country are you from?
I, I am Peruvians
a ya uh
And you?
I, well my family is Cuban
uh huh
uh But I was born over here in the United States
oh, okay and so what is your opinion about the nol?
From the telesales, I don't like it, I don't know who likes it
yes
that people call us to sell any eh, I don't know
No, it is, it refers to, to to it refers to telemarketing, those that show up pop ups via internet or, that, that they call on the telephone
eh, I don't believe that they are talking when they call you
ah, when they call you on the phone.
That when they call you on the phone and they sell you stuff and also when
ah,
when they send you e-mails
ah, smap yes
ven- of course, spam
aha
So, I don't know, I don't know if that convinces anyone, I have never bought anything or looked any e-mail seriously
yes
I don't know and
ah, me neither, I don't believe that that, that I have bought thing via internet, I have not bought stuff on the internet, online.
yes I eh, bought things via internet but no
but not from what they send on spam
of course,
no, no other things that one really needs, no
of course of course, well, it must be, it must be effective.
No,and
it should be that someone sees those emails and is convinced if not
yes sure, sure their are people that invest that is why they like this e get worried to send all those emails and the
um
and small business o i don't know who does that,then they invest your money doing that.
sure
sure no and that by phone yes by phone, it really bothers eespecially one is busy
mhm sure
yeah annoying
don't know is yes yes,ah intend to use those lists they say do not call
yeah
or is there like you can enroll to a list and with supposedly do not call your number,but I don't know
I am enroll and the same they call me at times
yes certain that yes
but not as much,not as much as before
mhm yes sure yes,no at times no and the persons that sell are very persistant sometimes
Um I always say I say a no like what,like I can not talk now, can not talk now and i hang up for not I really do not want to listen to the story that they will tell me because I know I will not
yeah
I'am not going to buy
of course I'am not interested
mm
if sometime you have people, and other times you have like they say scams that call you, to sell you something and sometimes the ending is some obscure, you have cases like that
yes yes, that too
illegal stuff they offer
yes
they offer selling you through phone or internet too
yes it has to be an awful job my sister did that like a week or so
Ah yes, yes, lot of families were employed
and she was coming home crying because all the people
no one wanted to buy
right, no, no one wants to listen, like
yes, not even listen
like all the people hang you, and she was coming like that upset and she left in a week
Right, not a really good job, it's not, doesn't reward you too much, it makes you miserable
no, besides the pressure you, when you have a job like that and with all the pressure ah,
right
ah, you have to sell, and they listen to you, while you call the manager listens to you
yes
and see how you are going and if you're not
they pay her a commission, definitely
of course, and if you're not effective, or they pay you a lot less, i feel a little sorry for people
yes sometimes one thinks, its no good good to do a job like any other kind of job, right
Of course, of course, like, they are also trying to earn money, but i don't want to go them money, that's the problem.
mhm mhm
i don't know what it is, i respond the enquiries, like they call me with enquiries, so what do they want to know.
ha
That if I'm going to vote for anyone, and who im voting for, i don't know i think, that the political situation right now, that makes the enquiries understandable.
mhm
I think that's its good, that they have different opinions.
of course
and i like to contribute with something like that, because its like an investigation for
mm like research
of course, but they're asking me for money, just answers, i can give opinions, not money.
of course, now nobody will know who they really are, to be honest, who is lying.
of course of course, i also don't want to have what their selling to me, i mean i read news on the internet.
and i don't want diaries in my house
yes
uh, and i don't know what else they sell, life insurance, i dont want that.
Insurance, vacations
mhm, you won a car
yes that, that is truly
that you just have to go to Miami to find it.
yes, or that he won that but, must sent an amount of money to assure your prize
of course
a matter
Of course, not the most part of those things
mhm
it's all know how to wing money, because if it was not for that they would not be winning
of course
someone has to pay those people's salary
yes, they really have to be careful and not
mm of course, that is the other thing that tometimes
no
they call and say they have, they leave a message and say you must call a certain number so get your price
yes
and the number ends up being a a number that charges you money for calling them
mm
or rather is like those number nine-hundred, a nine-hundred that charge money for calling them, so then
oh, on top everyone must pay the long distance, yes, you must be very careful besides that. No, but many people paying because they want more business
mm
No that for- a form of publicity that they say.
I think that it is cheap, I mean I think that it is cheap for the company to do this kind of publicity, I mean they probably pay very little
to, to the people who are calling
yes
in fact sometimes those people who are calling are not even in the United States
a, yes, yes that is true
but they have like communication systems
mmh
that allows people to call you from India
a yes exactly
and you can't tell, the way they speak English in India
yes the accent they have
I mean, like they do like outsourcing
aha
like they pay people in those countries, to call you, to sell you stuff, can you imagine?
um
how little they must pay those people
Clearly because in India they don't pay very much, because of that
they are making the calls that way that if they make one or two sales per person, they are still making money I mean they do it because of that, because they cannot
I mean, they must not sell much like that.  But since they pay so little to their employees, they must earn a bit because of that
well, because in India it is a way of life completely different and yes you pay, pay less to the people
Of course because it is a poor country
Yes so those people are anxious to work in whatever job, no
Yes I heard that sometimes when you call help desk with a question about your computer or something like that when you call for help many times the people that answer are from India.
yes yes it is true, here the big, for example the big telecomunications enterprise from here South, Bell South
mhm
No and always, sometimes my wife calls, I call for some problem with the telephone, with the internet that we have and yes, yes the people that you call, that answer are in India.
of course sometimes the communication is really bad.
No yes mhm Sure, and you sometimes don't understand because they don't speak
sure or sometimes because there is a lag it's like they don't listen and they don't listen
mhm mhm
in the end what happens to the communication if I'm calling the phone company and the communication is bad but it is because they are far away so
Sure, right now yes
incredibly to think like that because they are also in a different time it should be twelve hours difference in India
I assume there are people that work that I don't know maybe all the time no
Sure, o, o, work at night
O work, yes work at night
That people should call more during the day than at night here so those people must be calling at night, or working at night there
so let's say it is three in the evening here
yes more or less mhm
how great, I don't know, I don't know, em maybe I don't know, I mean maybe it is worth it for those people maybe it is better than the other jobs there
of course well to see what else we say so the twelve minutes go by.
of course it is a bit, to talk too much about this subject that like sometimes the subjects you get
mhm
there isn't much to say
Right, like the last time when they called for the dates thing
yes
they called to "fechar" (?)
"fechar" (?), that was for translating from English
yes it's an
it's a machine that translates from English to Spanish
it's an question not an issue, i said, what is "fechar" ?
"fechar" (?), me too i was listening that "fechar", what could be "fechar" (?)
yes
after from Spanish "fecha", "fechar" could be go out with a girl
yes, instead of "dating"
what, small mistake, like in a language study
yep, right
is, is supposed that this is a linguistic study
Right
and they can't really translate the words to Spanish
Right, right, exactly that, isn't the best there is not even the complete translation or the appropriate one
Right, isn't a machine, it's a
Hello
Hello, good evening
Hello good evening, I am Nicole from New York
Oh, here it is Norma from Atlanta, Georgia
Hello, how are you?
good, and then, we spoke yesterday right?
no, not yesterday, because yesterday I did not make any calls we spoke before
oh, okay, yes, yes,
But, the topic I do not remember any more, or maybe the topic about the telemarketers
yes, yes, I think we did talk
yes, we spoke I think it was Friday
yeah,
We spoke about the same topic, how stupid
yeah,
what else are we going to say
yes, that's what I was thinking about
well, lets talk about something else because, what are we going to say, we are not going to have the same conversation as before
of course, because no, I don't think anyone would agree with telemarketing.
no, and are you from Peru
Yes, I am from Peru
ah, and, how long have you lived here?
two years, aha
ten years, do you have family here?
no no no, but I came to the temple to which I belong
aha
no, but I came here for the religious association that I belong to
ah yeah
that way mhm
and wine or girl or adult?
no, I came to see it in ninety-five
mm yeah yeah, and you do that in Atlanta?
where do you work?
mhm
I do not work, my husband works
ah, yeah
,
that's good
I am here with the children at home, we're good for now
yeah
I was left alone here, to rest,
How many children are them?
I've got two, two little men that are uh
Two sons what?
Two men
Oh, yeah
They're, you imagine how are they supposed to be, they're, men are always more active, children
Yeah, I can guess, I spent my childhood with my sister, I mean, both of us girls so
Oh, there you go
I don't know how are they
Oh, aren't you married
No, not yet
Ah, aham
And I live, I live by myself, but near to my parents
Oh, OK
Hmm
Oh, there's where he is, isn't it? at
I'm twenty-seven years old
Oh, you see, I'm forty-one
Yeah no I, I mean I'd love to have a family, get married and have a family but
Hmm
I don't know, at the moment, no
The adequate person does no appear
no, it's the same, I don't know, my boyfriend, the same, we get along well, perhaps
mhm
but we have been together for a year
mhm
so we are waiting a little
mhm
but perhaps yes, I hope so
yes, he is still young
yes, the same as
yes, well, when someone gets married it's different, it's
clearly
no and one has more obligations
clearly
it's not the same liberty as before, especially if you have kids
clearly, clearly, no I like to live alone, sometimes yes it's a little bit lonely, since I like to go out, do things
mhm
see other people but if now, it's too lonely, but I don't know, everything has it's time, I believe,
Clearly, yes, this is true but on hold or at least not not yet, this is decided
of course
no next to of a few more of your or to reserve a bit more of your freedom I suppose it must be that way, no?
of course, because, because it is a lot of work and when one has a family that is a lot of work
yes
and myself, and myself I like to be alone, it is like I tell you, I like, I like the quite times I like to think and read
mhm
I think when, when I have children
mm
oh, it is going to be very difficult to do those things
oh, that is right you are correct
so what
when the the kids are small they are babies and oh no, one does not even have time to eat or even bathe
of course of course I went to visit a friend of mine who has a daughter
OK
the daughter is like six weeks old
oh, yes a baby
that is small and, I do not know my friend with, with with the baby always, that is, she does not leave her
of course, the babies are like that, exactly, mhm
that is, she is with her at every single moment, but no she, she is very happy but, it is a huge responsibility until the grow up a little
no, that is right, when the kids are still very small one needs to be with them all the time
Uh, and ¿how old are your, uh, children?
Oh, my children are, one is seven and the other one is three.
Oh, i see.
Yes, they're still very young too.
Sure, of course...
They're children, right?, and...
How cute to have, to have children, i mean, having a family is, i believe, the best of life
Yeah...
I don't know, maybe in a few years from now, I'll leave, i'll dedicate myself to peacefulness.
Sure, of course, enjoy, enjoy while you can and
sure
Sure, because if you don't, you...
And your, your husband, uh, ¿did you meet him here on the United States?
Yes, he is american, he is a brunette American
I see
I married a... he's also, he just lives in the temple.
OK
He's from the same religion, so we met there.
Ok, ¿and what religion is that?
Oh, I'm from the Hare Krishna movement.
Oh yea, look, yea
i don't know, if he has heard.
yea, i studied in the, in the university, i studied Buddhism that,
mhm
its like, the same thing, right?
mhm, yes,yes we are vegetarians, there aren't any.
What about in peru, is there hari krishna as well? there should be,
oh, yeah, there's many temples in peru, around the world as well.
mm, and, are the kids vegetarian as well, right?
oh, yes of course,
oh,
they are vegetarian since they'e born.
and do they ask for meet?
no no, they are,
no?
not until now, when they were little, we taught them to be vegetarian.
of course
yeah, so, they don't really ask anything, and when they are teenagers, that's when they'll start, i dont know, nobody will make them do something they dont want, right?
of course mm
they aren't kids anymore, they can choose they're own things when they grow up.
sure, sure
no, they have to choose or they have to see
yes, I was a vegetarian for many years
ah, yes? mm
I was a vegetarian for about ten years, but then I went to Chile, I was living with a boyfriend over there and really, it was hard to keep on being a vegetarian because
mm
because, he ate meat and if I prepared vegetarian stuff
ah
he would put like a piece of meat in the middle, like he didn't want to eat like that
ah, yes?
so I left him, I left him there because he was like very complicated, and then when I returned and I continued but I don't eat much meat, like
aha
I never cook meat in the house, only
when they eat a lot
sure, if I eat out or if I go to someone else's house and they make something there yes but in the house only vegetables and legumes
I like, mm, I prefer eating like this
mm
I mean
sure, is healthier, no?
mm
is healthier and even better for digestion
mm, yes, the truth is that I do not like meat much, I like fish better
mhm
I don't know, do you eat fish or not?
no, no, we do not eat meat, eggs or fish
no, not fish but meat in fact, I don't like it anymore
no, and are you still with the same boyfriend?
no, no we broke up.
oh, well, now maybe another, another boyfriend suggest, maybe is does not like to eat meat, and make him vegetarian, is much easier you are vegetarian
if you have never been in a relationship with a vegetarian, never
mhm
and, and I have had like 5 boyfriends
yeah,
like, serious boyfriends
really
oh rather, more or less serious
yeah,
but all eat meat, and they liked meat, even the one right now also
yeah
he likes the hamburgers and chicken
well. some people look tilted well, it´s - like a habit, they were born, born like that, didn´t they?
mm, sure
grew up eating meat and they don´t know to - there is another alternative no, it depends did you hear something, but it´s that that never imagined how it is like, did the?
mmm
because being a vegetarian, it really has nothing to do, there´s nothing to envy people who eat meat, I´m vegetarian I don´t eat meat since twenty yeas ago-
mmm
no, and and you really feel very good it´s healthier, no, not even, doesn´t look her age.
sure,
she is vegetarian
yes right, to me, I, I prefer it because
no but it´s different, right
the meat makes me feel full, like heavier
sure it´s very he- it´s very heavy for digestion it´s that the human body is not used to it, right? to eating and eating meat, it´s not carnivorous,
mmm, but people that are used to eating meat, uhh like they feel hungry when they don´t eat meat.
yes because, it´s that really when you start being vegetarian you don´t know how to fee- balance your nutrition.
mmm, sure, you don´t have to worry about, about, about having proteins
of course not, I mean, you also have to eat and look for proteins that are going to tone no
mmm
find, I don´t fin- that does not eat meat in
mmm
tofu? no? soy, in different procuts? no? like so
of course and milk and yogurt and that all
Oh, we don't drink, we are lacto-vegetariam
Oh I see
There are many things you can eat being vegetariam, you start looking for those things now that I'm vegetarian
I don't understand how people can't eat meat
Of course, You get used to it
Of course, and you eat so many delicious things, as a vegetarian you have nothing to envy
Of course, I like it. I also like many Indian music, which has many vegetarian dishes
Oh yes
Asian food in general, I really like it
Mmm
Chinese and Japanese food, I really like eating fish
Oh, I see
But, what else was I going to ask you?, I had other question but i forgot it, do you children speak Spanish or English?
Well, they don't talk that much of Spanish, they know some words, they understand quite a bit of Spanish, but not too much
Of course, but because you speak English with your husband
Yes, It's not that difficult, I try to teach them Spanish, but hey talk English at high school
Mmm
Specially the older one
Mmm
hy, good good, I'm Laiya
hy how are you, aha, we want to talk of what, i didn't understand perfectly the
ah yes we have to talk about spam, unwanted commercial publicity, telemarketing and such, sometime if they call you at home not to sell you things or they send you mail or e-mail, that kind of stuff
aha, i had the phone have to get me another phone because this one can't increase the volume and have to change it
you can't hear me well
ah yes i heard you right but i didn't heard the machine before
is that, and beside that the machine speaks Spanish pretty badly
yes yes, right, speaks Spanish with an American accent, got me
yes and then the accent is not that good either, i don't know lot of stuff but i got some of it yes
right, the things is that the Spanish language has lots of words too and ah, not only that but
expressions, yes. mja, yes
from different countries, regions, that call things differently, you understand, i am here, in New York, and i was talking to
some Puerto Ricans  and they call the orange like
mja, china
china yes, i would never accept that even if a Chinese person that comes from China
yes yes, yes, mja
a woman but that is colloquial then their Spanish isn't that much only, okay, we were talking about telemarketing right
yes, yes
aha because i am in a list of, i don't know if you know that a list that you put you name on it
aha, ahh
with the government, and they can't call you, i think that list exists but i don't know where
ok, legally they are not able to send you unwanted publications
they are able to send me, but they are not able to call me
oh, they are not able to call you, ok, OK
the unwanted call list began around two years and a half, because the people had complaints
mhm, mhm
because they were calling you in your nap time and all of it, so i put my name in that list
and they don't call you, it really works, OK
not to ask, but if i don't pay my bills, they call me
sure, that's OK if they call you for that
yes, if i don't pay my bills they call me, and also something is going to happen with the email
ok,ok
i don't know if you have a computer, but if you have one, they send you a lot there
yes, yes well, i just have one year living in USA, then i believe the marketing companies don't know me, then they don't call to sell me stuff
OK
and by mail some things,but not to much, my problem is my email, i have many email accounts
from the private university i erase daily around fifty publicity emails
mm
watches, pills, treatments and all that stuff
and where are you from, how many years do have here in the USA
I've only been here for one year, alone. Yes, I am from Barcelona, Spain.
Wow, one year. What Country are you from? Oh, you are from Spain. Oh yes, because I am a Hispanic from Latin America.
Yes, yes, yes then, oh from Panama that's very good indeed.
Yes, but in Panama, Panama is very commercial, even for a small country, do you understand?
Yes, I was in Costa Rica, I was relatively close to Panama, I was in Costa Rica last year.
Yes, but Panama is much more advances than Costa Rica. Yes, yest there is much
Yes, aha, Costa Rica appeared to be a country that was doing well, right?
Oh, yes, huh
You could not see misery in the streets without knowing it.
Yes, yes but Puerto Rico is the most democratic country in the America Continent, yes.
Ha, ha, ha, like it doesn't have a military, right?
It doesn't have the military and all it's politics. The politics in Costa Rica is more peaceful of all.
Ha, ha, ha, mm, yes, yes
I'm telling you the truth when I say that in the U.S. we have different political parties, and every year one is in power or they are in power for 2-3yrs and then another party and they do this perfectly well.
yeah, yeah
Without military the government is unable to use force, do you understand.
aha, very good, yes, yes, haha
Many people do not know that in Panama our businesses are more advanced.
aha, clearly, clearly, aha
You will see people from different countries at the Panama Canal, from all over the world. Lot's of people go there.
hmm yeah
working with the ships, right, the big ships, how do you say, Junk Ship, and ship right, and they wanted to stay, they stayed in Panama
yeah, yeah, sure, sure
And they didn't go back to their country, so it's a lot of people who couldn't leave right, and had political problems in their country, and when they arrive, when they're working on the ship
yeah, yeah, look
when they get to Panama, you know, how do you say, they get off the ship and blend with Panamanian people
sure, how many inhabitants does Panama have? in the whole country
ah, like three thousand, the whole country has three thousand
wow, only three thousand, wow, so small, so tiny
yes, it's a tiny country, a country that's well developed for business, for business, yes
wow, how small, yes, yes
yes, very small, it only has three thousand pesos, three thousand people, but not three millions, not three thousand, three millions no, oh oh oh, what am I saying, three millions, I'm sorry
ah ah ah, okay, okay, okay, three thousand, I mean, it's smaller than my town, okay, three millions is not a lot, but yes, three millions makes more sense
no three millions, three millions, no no, it's three millions, not three thousand because a friend of mine was here in Brooklyn, in New York, and I was in a business library
yeah, yeah
a business library, and I looked at the yellow books, phone numbers in Spain, you know what a yellow book is, a yellow book is phone numbers, phone numbers yes
yes, yes, the yellow pages, yes, yes
the yellow pages, the yellow pages for all Spain was not as big as Brooklyn's, and Brooklyn is a tiny part of the USA, you know what I mean, ah, the city of New York has five boroughs, right
yes, yes, yes, there are a lot of people
Brooklyn one of the boroughs and the whole pages for Spain wasn't
uh huh uh huh and you have many years here
yes yes about thirty years but but if I have more than thirty years here yes yes I have many years here and I am more americanized than Latino
uh huh, no no yeah it's noticeable by the accent that when you speak english, when you speak English uh I mean
very good too, the thing that depends on the person and
uh huh uh huh, of course, uh huh uh huh uh huh
the education and the people that you're with all of the time, understand because if you have gone to the university or something like that you still continue speaking in a certain manner, understand, because I am going to tell you the truth
uh huh, uh huh
uh I have a professor, a teacher here from right I went to Brooklyn College she was the... a teacher of a teacher of of spanish, of teaching Spanish
uh huh, uh huh
but her class was about Spanish literature, understand like Don Quijote, Lazarillo of Tormes and all that
uh yes I remember when I went to the institute
and I don't remember Lazarillo of Tormes the first, the first picaresque novel
uh huh uh huh, uh huh
the thing that she that is the worst teacher I've had in my whole life and she learned Spanish from the book not by speaking at home
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's very different it's very different yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
like the machine, the machine that you heard but she speaks it better than the machine you see but she knew Spanish very well it's just that she had to study so much about Spain that when the moors had entrails and all that
uh huh
she had to visit certain how do you say it in New York we have a museum right
uh huh, oh yes uh huh what museum is this, uh huh
where the architecture of Spain is taught a lot, go and the influences that the moors have had uh on the influence of Spain is and we have certain words like the word hopefully is Arabic yes
I wish, there are, there are a lot of Arab words in Spanish
yes, because when I tell you "ojalá" (I hope) we go to the movies tomorrow, right
hmm, sure, sure, I hadn't seen that before, yes
ojalá, but what I'm telling you is o-alá, about the God Allah, do you see? but speaking about all that telemarketing and spam you say you don't get a lot
I don't get a lot via phone or mail, but I do get a lot via email, electronic mail, a lot
no, no, email right oh please, oh believe me, oh, I get it via, I have yahoo, what do you have?
I, well, I have several, hotmial, gmail, the one in my American university and the one in the Spanish university, so
oh please
I spend the whole day reading different emails, it's horrible, yes
and not only horrible, but those people are really, how do you say in english, right, I'm practically telling you, they're really creative
what, what what, yes, yes
they know how to write things that you'll want to read
and
or tell you things that you'll want to look at, I tell you, they're really, ah
they have imagination, no, yes they have creativity
imagination, yes, they have a good imagination
There's one I get almost every week, it comes written in french
yeah
it's, well, it tells me that the woman who writes is the widow of an African dictator who died, and who has I don't know how many millions
ohh, oh, millions, oh no
and is asking for help to get out those millions and that also
ah no oh and look that has increased a lot in the last six months ah
yes yes yes
there has been a large increase in that previous, it says that I won something in England and that I have to go to England to claim my thousand pesos or dollars what they have and that oh forget about it
ah yes yes also yes yes I ask myself if someone really believes in those stories no
but they say yes yes
because I don't know, it seems incredible that someone could bite, but if they send them is that someone, I don't know, someone bites
for me they send, many of those they send them from another country and they send like two thousand right two million
yes yes, yes sure
and the expect that one or two people, you get me
yes yes yes nowadays there's no effort in sending an email to millions of people I mean that but I don't know I think it's incredible that someone could bite
yes eh incredible that they say one tells me that if the man has like fifty thousand pesos if they don't answer
yes yes yes, yes yes some stories, some impressive stories
fifty thousand, fifty million and not the cont- and I that that that they are crazy and they are from many countries they say and many they say are from Nigeria, Nigeria and eh eh
yes yes yes from Nigeria and also like I am in university we organize conferences
aha
so there are people that register for the conference and they they ask like money to come, well, some stories so complicated that sometimes you don't know if people are true or it's a lie, I mean with that of the Internet
oh
sometimes you don't know if if you're talking to someone real or if they're completely pulling your leg, it's...
but and the thing eh I don't think that the government can, like to know can't know who is the person that's sending, who is what they are sending that
ah yes, it's that it's complicated because it's so easy to hide your identity not that
yes and also the thing that when they send all those letters yes eh, it's difficult when well it says eh well you know that what they are trying to get your boys, you understand the money but
mja

Nicole
Nico, Nico, I don't understand, but it is not a Spanish name, no?
Nicole, Nicole no, no, it is not a Spanish name
I am Pilar
What is your name?
Pil Pilar
Pilar, and from where?  where are you from?
from Spain
Ah look Eh, and where are you now?
In New York
Ah look, What part of New York?
yes um
In what part of New York?
Oh, In what part of Madrid, ehm, oh, in Manhattan?
To in
But well we have to talk, we are getting sidetracked and they are not going to pay us, the topic for today is the telesale no
yes
And what do you think?
yes
When they call you on the phone to try and sell you something.
I don't like that.
no nothing of course
And you? uhm
I don't know nobody that, that, that likes that, in fact. I don't knw anyone that has ever bought never nothing by, by telephone.
yes, me neither, me neither, I think that it is always a bother.  That is more than anything
But let's see, I think that so- somebody must buy them because if not
yes, it must be, that is it must be that they make money with that because if not, they wouldn't do it.
yes. Of course but they can make too little because I
that is
I have never heard of anyone who that doesn't bother, I even think that it hurts them more
uhm
because it is like negative advertising for them.
¿What?
Because they are calling people to their homes and bothering them.
Um
Well, people is basically not giving a good opinion, right?
No, no, there must be people that, sometimes i think that people who are alone, like maybe older people, if they're alone and
and like, they like to talk.
Yeah, well, yeah
They could like, start a conversation. Also, sometimes older people like, they're like more confused, like they can
they can be convinced to sell them something
they can convince them a little more
Unfortunately, yes
But i also think that the majority of the young people, i don't know now, i don't know, there must also be young people that can be convinced, but, i think that very busy people, they don't want to waste their time in
in having a conversation like that.
Right, right, and spam also
To, i mean, they're, in my email all the spam goes to like a different folder
Right
The email does that automatically
And you, it's less annoying then, right?
Yeah, that's it, i don't even look at it, i don't even open that folder, it's like it's always there. And it's, the website itself deletes it after thirty days or something.
And no, you never check it for
hardly ever, sometimes yes, sometimes i go and see, but. ya n, because hundreds arrive for example now there are two hundred and fifty and no like i get bored looking
I, I do check, I check every time i enter I see the spam email because once it had happened to me that some email was not spam
um, yes
it has gone to the spam folder but the majority of the people do not check it and it has happened to me that i write someone
and they don't answer me, and they dont answer me
maybe in the spam
And it was because it had gone to their spam folder,and they did not even looked before they earase do you understand?
Sure
I see it that way,but rare time,almost always in the, is good, almost always they send spam to the spam folder
yes
and I do not receive anything from spam to the inbox
how good, how good, what service you use?
hOW?
What e-mail you use?
have various,have from Yahoo and from Hotmail,have various and it is good,because,because the spam is well protected, a virus can not go in
em yes good, I never open spam emails  but I check the list. Like to see if someone, if another person has called but no.
em do not open because I believe that
No but yes even sometimes you can get email from people you know but they are virus
um yes
And that also does not let you open is fine,is fine
yes that is what they say.  Of course, I don't know if that really happens, I think that you have to open, the e-mail, and also open the attachment like a
The what
a file, you have to open something they send with the e-mail
yes
Because if not I don't think that they can send a virus like that, just for having sent the e-mail
Not if you you have to download the whole file, but that is what Hotmail doesn't let you, it doesn't let you download the file
OK that's better
Because really it has many tricks, those emails with viruses and many times it looks like yes, it is a person you know who is sending something that interests you.
um
And it is, it is a virus. I mean that you have to be very careful.  And and the those who send ads through the internet, I mean they send spam really they are selling stuff
yes, yes
I, I don't understand that, who buys from them.
If they are selling and also I mean like pornographic things
yes, it is almost always
I don't know pills,
yes all that is illegal, they sell, through, in that way.
hu
eh, pills that are not approved, that, they promise miracles and people believe it, I don't understand.
Uh.
who believes that
Well, there must be people that, let themselves group for those things, the simply let them themselves
Of course
I don't know..I met a women that believes those emails that says that someone from the government
needs help and that if you help them with money they would muliply the mount you gave them
Wow..that's crazy
yes, she always believes that, I think she isn't alright. She is a little bit crazy or something, but she always believes
She always believes and she has lost a lot of money
It's really dangerous, Many people has spent a lot of money in those kind of things
Yes, it's true, or that other thing about selling things that not so many people buys, but they told you that
you are going to make the money, many people sends the money hoping they are going to receive more. I think there is a lot of people dreaming about that
Yes..there is some people a little bit crazy
Yes
That is lack of intelligence, lack of a real thinking process. Let's see, how is going to be true?, why did I received that email, from all the email accounts in the world?
Yes, you are right, but there's still people believing in those things
Yes
There are the only ones in the world of getting a profit from there, people want to dream about that
Of course
It's like gambling, people gamble thinking in getting a big profit out of it, even when everybody loses
Yes, because practically the casino wouldn't exist
Of course, But there is always people who think that gambling will make them rich
yeah
And, good, good with betting some will win money, there should be some. But few
It's good that they go to have fun for a day, those that go because they don't have an addiction and they need to play and those that do it professionally. Because they have certain games, I think that if you hear of a game, it's black jack
Right.
where you have the probability that if you play well, you'll win money.
Right, or poker too a little, or not.
That, I don't know.
Yeah poker I think ha- it's like
I think you fail, but I guess that
poker's like psychological because you have to seem like you have more than you have or less than you have, I don't know
it's like all a game that way then
right, in the poker I know, I saw a documentary with people from MIT who had their tricks for counting their cards, which is illegal, of course, the casino is really prepared, anything that you can do to beat the casino, they prohibit
Of course um
And it isn't really cheating, cheating would be, well, to mark the cards you have
Right, no, no this is like
cards up your sleeve, but if you have the ability to count cards, why is that going to be cheating? So they went, casino to casino so they don't get caught
Right
winning a little bit in each, not winning too much in each casino so as not to call attention to themselves, but they catch them and they bar them from entering the casinos.
Yeah, look.
And they had to go to Europe to win in the casinos in Europe.
ha
that's funny.
look
But, what if no one
But I think it's good that the people wins because most of the time people loose money, there most be ones that win
sure, it's just that nobody gives away money, people want to believe that
um
It's really weird that for anyone to give away something, so rare. They are always looking for something in return. The thing with the lists, you've included your telephone number
yes, I'm inscribed there.
Does it work?
Yeah, I still get some calls but not as much as before. It does take some time before it really starts working, it takes about a couple of months
And then you start realizing that, they say, they say, we are putting you up in the list, the list will begin in about three months.
But then you realize that you are getting fewer calls.
Good
You still get some calls but, I don't know
However, this list is not mandatory, I mean, it should be mandatory that if you place your number in the list, they can't call you.
um
But it's not, it's just a list for the companies so that they don't bother in calling people that
um
that have previously expressed a desire for not being called. It's a waste of their time and money.
um
Yes, many companies don't care, they try anyway.
Sure
They don't look at the lists, they call you and make you loose your time
yes, yes I think that, sure, I think that no, not all companies are like the.
And they loose the money.
they don't pay attention to the list or maybe, I don't know, maybe they don't have the list, I don't know who gets to that list.
hu
eh, it's like, that, I don't, I don't know if you put your name on in it, your number in it.
I know, yes
So, they call anyway
I never get them I'm lucky, my phone number is new.
um
I added it to the list in January and the calls that I got are from services, companies that I've hired some service from them.
Ah that's good.
They want to sell me more services.
um
That's annoying too
um
But, next time they call me from the same bank
um hu
they have called me several times for the same thing and I will tell them to please add me to their bank list
do not call
sure sure
I say they should have a list because hundreds of them or yes
sure
if one of their customers tells them not to call they are dumb to keep calling because the client can get mad and leave
sure
so I will try it to see if they can stop calling me the annoying bank employee, because they always want to sell me the same thing and I always say no you are trying to sell me the same
un sure
is they think that one day I will say yes because they insist i do not understand
um
Hello
Hello
yes
Is Tammy
Alex
Alex again, how are you?
Good.
I do not think there are too many people that do this survey
I do not think there are too many people, no
because I have already spoken to you three or four times.
Well, will you be paying us.
and another person, two or three, no, I think that after we speak, of what is said, I thinks so
yes
oh, no, no, It is our fault that we do not have too many people that go in the survey
yes, okay, same
is funny
I am here at this time.
And today I do it early and I could not, and so I said, I will call later and I forgot, and all of a sudden,
I always call at nine sharp. And is nine sharp.
yes.
Well, ¿what do you think about the telemarketing?
Well, i still think the same, i like some of them, other's not. So every now and then, i get mail here, today i got three.
again, about re-financing my home, i say no, those people don't leave you alone.
Sometimes there are very good offers.
Yeah
I like marketing more over the mail. Because it's not so, uh, ¿how can i tell you?, it's more private and you can see the offer without the pressure of the
of the call.
Yeah, that's, that's true, that's really true.
And sometimes there's, there are good offers, i don't throw out everything i get.
Um, i always check them out.
I, i, sometimes i look at things
Yeah, because, well, like i say, there are some where you can find something good if you look at it, but i don't like that on the phone.
Well, everything's a risk in life, i don't, i think there' aren't too many risky things, everything's a risk. Sometimes you'll win, and sometimes you'll loose, ¿right?
Yeah
The problem is when they bother you at improper hours. Or when they take advantage of someone
And sometimes they call me very early, and supposedly they can't call you until after eight. They call me before eight, but i don't answer.
Yeah, i really don't care, i usually don't answer calls.
If i see
I know that it's telemarketing
Yeah, i check the caller ID, and if, if i don't know who it is, then i wait for the machine to take it, if i know the voice, then i pick it up.
Yes
Sometimes, yes, sometimes if i pick up the phone and say, uh, i already know who it is and i say, no thanks, no thanks. Or, sometimes i act like i don't speak english.
So that they will leave me alone, i don't speak English there.
And do, do they speak to you in English or spanish?
in English
Never in spanish.
No, they haven't talked to me in spanish, only in english.
and ind, and because here, since there are a lot of Hispanic people here on Los Angeles, sometimes they call in spanish.
Yeah, over here they don't, it hasn't started yet over here, well. That's what i have to say.
Well, i think you're the only person that speaks Spanish in Seattle.
No, over here there are a lot.
According to the Fisher poll.
there must be, because yes, there are plenty around here, there are a lot of Mexicans around here.
Yes.
There aren't many, there are people from Panama, but i don't know many and
but they don't do marketing in spanish.
No, no, they ha, no one has called me. I don't know about other people, but they haven't called me.
And the other thing that bothers me, sometimes, there's a lot of marketing spam on the computer.
Oh yes
There's a lot of that, that should be controlled more by law.
I entered my e-mail inbox today and i had ninety-seven.
sometime a hace a special e-mail option to filter
aha
and sometimes i have a thousand e-mails, pure marketing
yes it's true
and i get to trash them, you spend 10 or 15 minutes to trash them all, when i could do something more important
too much, it's too much stuff that you don't even ask for, my husband was laughing yesterday because he got one marketing mail that was about nudist beches, and i was laughing too
yes wow
better, said, where did they know that i am ? and i yes i was laughing
That is incredible
i had a real laugh because i  was holding the letters, but the one they sent him, if you look at it on the outside, don't know, doesn't say nothing on that
he had it, in his jacket so that no one saw it, i said they will, who will start looking into you stuff. And yes i was laughing
you, why do they always send that ? I say, don't know, no clue
But sometimes you get good stuff, like a year now i got something to got at show around here
aha
and i won some tickets to Vegas and others to Disneylandia
ah
and i didn't spend nothing
That's good, aha
you have, sometimes when good things come out from the marketing
But you have to be careful when you get in.
yes, you have to be careful. Specially by computer and credit cards, because many times it's a trap
mhm
I have a friend that was fooled with marketing of a credit card
aha
and they took his money from the bank, from his account. Because he didn't think and gave them the number of his account
Ouch, mhm
and the charged him about two hundred dollars just to apply for the card
i remember, I also, when I went to see my lawyer. The girl that works at the office, the secretary, was crying. An I tell her, Why are you crying? she says, no it's that
a, this telemarketing have taken five hundred dollars from my account.
yes, because
First a hundred and fifty, the other one, and she was fighting, so the lawyer that she works for was going to help her with that
that happens very often, that shouldn't happen, never should you give out that information of ah, financial to a to a telemarketing party
No, people don't think about that
because they are going to steal from you, it's a legal robbery
I even when, when I buy things on the Internet. My husband and I have a bank account that, that, we only put money into that we're going to use on the Internet
that way, if we're going to spend sixty dollars that's what I place there and use the card and that's it.
and you know something else that has been very
what
eh, I have received letters from ah, foreign entities that want to send money to the United States
exactly, me too.
and and they want their bank account to do the transaction and I believe that it is like a trick where they are not going to give you anything they are going to clean out all the money you have in the bank.
I heard about that in the news, that they had caught a few people in the government of a, of an, African city.
yes, it comes out of Africa.
they were, mm
and from Great Britain too.  And one time I found out a company that was making me an offer because they were going to pay me a lot of money.
aha
And it happened that it was a fic- company it was not real.
yes to me I
They wanted to clean out the bank.
there are yes I with those people, I don't with those of my bank account, no.  no, no, no, they have even called me from Canada, for me to buy
lottery tickets.
mmh
in Canada, I say, for what? I say if I don't buy lottery tickets here, once in a while I do it I say so why would I get involved with the Canada lottery.
yes
no, what not, what yes, that you are going to become rich, no, no thanks.
yes well they always say that.
well yes, a, a card that they sent my husb- my son's girlfriend, who said that if she that she had won some earrings of
of diamond and a watch and some money and had to send them like two-hundred fifty dollars to send them his prize
yes
and she says to me, because she only is eighteen years old, I say, don't send anything without think like a crazy.
And, and also many times have happened to me that I have won things in the computer
mhm
but I have to do the survey, and in acue-survey I have to buy something.
yes
and, I already know that it is a trick, because you give your name, your address and your phone number.
mhm
and then they ask for more, they want that you buy anything.
Right, yes
Then I never do it and never have received nothing. to me I have never received something, is like a marketing
yes,
it should to have laws against that cheater.
yes because any person, there are persons that are is that way, that it is easy for them to be in things like that, when they listen that something is free. I say, when is free
Free or, or that you have won something.
mhm my husband always says me that when is something like that he reads everything, the the minute letter down, read it well, well because they can get something with you, that you have to pay something,
Because it is difficult after you signed, get something from you, that is.
in Spanish that is called  a hooking.
mhm so you should, I always tell that to my sister and to my kids
And there is a lot of this happening in Spanish as well
read everything if I haven't got anything in Spanish yet
You will get it one of these days
People don't think I'm Latin when they see me, so I pretend also. So now you have that, ...
you can call to get your telephone number deleted, t obe removed from the marketing, that's cool
yes, that's cool
But I don't know, I don't know, I could ask my husband, he knows about it. because they say it's free, you entre your phone number, and your name, and they remove you from
the list they have. because there are others who keep calling even if you tell them
I think they will keep on calling because they say that the calls are spontaneous. but how come they know your name also if they are calling spontaneously?
because
how can they know your name
because they buy the names, the names list
mhm
and sometimes, as they once told me, they go from number to number, from one, two, three, fou, five, they don't know my phone number but
they go exactly like this, one, two, three, four, five, the numbers like this. they dial directly like this
yes
so it's easy for them not to miss any because they follow an order
Thenm I think we agree, the best marketing is the postal one
mhm
or newspapers
Good evening, Milred, from Connecticut
Oh, good evening, this is Mercedes, from Philadelphia
How are you?
Pleasure to meet you.  Well  Let's see, we have to talk about politics
Aha
What do we think about it?  That, for me, is a rather difficult topic, because I have not been here much, well, I have, yes, like six years living here, but never, since I can n ot vote, I have never been interested much in, what is the politics of
And why can't you vote, because you have not registered, or because you don't want to?
Because I am not a citizen yet.
Oh, okay
I am only, oh, resident.  SO, I can not vote yet, and for e-
So the residents don't vote  I thought that y-
Don't, don't, don't vote.  We don't vote.  One has to be, uhm, citizen, to vote.  Do you vote?  Have you ever voted?
yes, I always vote.
Oh
There was a time were I would think, like that, I said, ah, I am not going to vote.  What for? But, uhm, later I, I got involved working with, with one of the parties.  Then I realized that yes, that we need to vote, especially the Hispanics
so they can hear our voice and our vote there, that it counts.
yes, And what do you think of the Democrats or the Republicans or the differences between them?
Well, so, look, I, I vote for my party.  But sometimes, when I like a candidate from another party, I vote for him too.
Hmm
I don't know  How do you say? it doesn't me, it doesn't me, I am not a fan of, of, really, of I don't know, so, what they say, well, just, Could it be just an idealist from that party, but that
when I see that one candidate is going to do something good for my community or the Estate, then, I do vote for him, even if he is of other
and, I vote for the other candidates that, that my party has. But I don't, to say, don´t, don't try to, how is it said?
Only with the polit- line of the party.
Aham, Aham.
Ah, sure, sure, sure. Ah and about the, to say, about what people sa- good, what people, the, eh, the conception of , eh, the democrats being more liberal, and the republicans being a little more
conservative. What do you think? conservative what do you think about that?
yes, I believe that they are a little more, more conservative in certain aspects. But, in some other things, well, sometimes they go too far.
yes.
Yeah. Because of that, I believe that it is not, no, they do not stay much in the government, because they leave like, like, like they get afraid. After they go into things, it's like
they get afraid, and roll back, or they stay
yes, I think, too, is that, eh, perhaps like, eh, ah, ah they are not much of being in the middle. Right? but instead
they are to a side, as they are like very ex- no very extremist, but they have the extremes. I believe that perhaps
But the fact that they are conservative tells you that, you know, they stay out of things that they do not want to pass by. Because they comply to much to
ethical matters, and of, of politics, you know. They follow too much, I believe, that, the concepts. The democrats, well, what they see it is going for
even, even if the people leaps on them, so, they at once are going to, you know, they do it. Even when everybody leaps on them to tell no, that they do not want what they are
putting in. But, in truth, well I don't know. In my country, at least, the democrats, em, they have, they have the control like for about twenty eight years.
Mhm
and, after those twenty eight years that the leader died, who was the strong leader of the party, well, already then, it has been, you know, some years they vote democrats,
others, the other next four years they vote republicans, and then they go back to the democrats, and they put the republicans again, it depends. It is like they depend on, on, on how they see the country situation. If they see that the country, in all that four years nothing was made, then, they make the person leave.
So it is here, so it is, eh, and it is so here too. But, at times, that, eh, is so in my country, I also say. But, sometimes is not so, eh, eh, a- I would like that they realized that perhaps is a matter of the person, not so much about the party.
Aha, aha
Really? or, or, another thing, I don't know, because also, eh, it is the other side of
yes.  I think, but if a candidate, this, if a, if a party has a good candidate, and, and like, because look, this man who governed Puerto rico, who was Luis Muñoz Marín,
he governed for twenty-eight years.  He did many good thing, you know, brought much progress to the country, brought things to the country that, well, that really, the country when it was behind, well, he pushed it ahead.
Mmh.
So, well, he, he kept control, then of all the people.  And, after that, that he died, many, they generations stayed, I mean, they still continued.
Even though he was dead, what they followed was his idealism.  They didn't, really, this, they didn't see that, that that was what they were doing, but that it was because, like they were
popular party which is Democrat, well, that was the one who went.  it was his, his, how do you say it? to his leader.  But, it was not true for, because they saw that there was nothing being done well.,
Mmh.
that I don't find that it should be like that.  Do you understand? I fid that if a candidate, well, well, you see that it can be better, well, give him an opportunity.
But, some times, eh, em, what I wanted to say too, is that people who are like too much with what is the party.  True?
Eh, and that it doesn't
Fanaticized, you think.
yes.  I mean, that don't maybe the candidate does not have the charity, right? But, like they vote for their party, they, eh, that is what I, some times, mm, it doesn't seem.  But, also, at the same time,
eh, there are people that go too, only, maybe not with the qualifications, eh, intelectual or the capacity of the candidate, but with their charisma as a person.
Aha, aha.
That happens a lot in my country, it is like that, eh, people complain, they fall in love, as they say.
yes, because of a face, because of a face and because a,
En, en, and because of what, eh, yes.  For life- I don't know, for the impression that has been given and no, maybe, not for, eh
for some gestures.  But,
your resume or curriculum. Is it? It's what can do or cannot do.
Well, but, as always, all the politicians promise, I do this, I do, I do, I do, and when they get there, they forget what they had to do.
Or, maybe not that they forget, maybe they found much, much opposition. Because especially when they win a game that is, the Democrat's and
and most of the camera are won by the Republicans, then it makes it much harder to have the parcel. Well not all of them are going to approve all the laws they want, nor will they approve all that he decided to. Understand?
Yea.
And they are the majority, and those who go to, to, to vote and stand against the decision, well, many times I find that it is difficult to do so
a leader who is good but does not win the rest of his party, then it becomes very difficult, you know, eh, erm- erm- erm
better put everything he wants in the favor for community
Mhm
Because then the others will not give them the opportunity
Mhm.
I think, is depending on, on, you know, if, if we assume the Democrats win and almost all are Democrats
Yes.
but when a Democrat wins, and everyone else are Republicans, they make their life difi-
And that is something that to me seems counterproductive. Right? Because one would think, that when already is everything, one would like, perhaps, an ideal world that once in power, all the work for the wellness of, of all.
But there some also working to their own benefit, not for the community profit actually.
Exactly, exactly. And that's why, let's say, for example, here how they are divided, let's say, when when passing laws. Right? That first is the Congress, after it, the Senate and then President. Right?
But, usually, a lot of laws are initiated by the president. Right? But you have to spend the challenge of the senate, and, if the senate belongs to
the party with the majority is from a opposite party, there's a big problem. In other words, it seems to me that's good because ah, erm,
because there is some control. Right? In equity between the two parties. But at the same time, it slows the, the things and that is, is, the bureaucracy is left to decide.
Yes, I see, it's a bureaucracy
Yes
With is placed. Then, fights and problems stats
And another thing, I have read that many of the things made in the United States, I mean laws and bills are president initiative, right?
But, usually they are done as a group, right? of, uh, of initiatives in only one document, for example. Right? Because, as, they, they are presented once.
to, to, to the Senate. For example, one day, and they put as addendum, or added, right? to the law, that this other law, this other law, maybe people don´t support those other, but do support the main.
But, like those other were not attached to this one, they are not passed. Then, they say, no. No, we don´t pass them because of, because of that. Right? And, maybe, the main idea was that one that everybody agreed, but, now
they have to start again.
yeah. That´s why, I tell you that whenever, whenever they are not the same party, it always brings a lot of problems. Then, some people want one thing and some people want another.
Mhm.
So, no, you never know what they are going to, the truth, to me, me, in politics, well, I´m telling you, with m, I got involved as,
after I arrived here, like, like four years ago, that I began to participate, to take more action in the, because I saw that, they did not want to approve many things for Hispanics, and
that they were not not treating very well. So, I got involve in, in politics to help. But, it is also a lot of ins and outs, and they take you, they even look up the flakes you have, to take them all, you know.
Mhm, mhm.
Everything they can look to find you, if you run for, for any position, forget it, they investigate your family, and they take you out, that if you sell this, if you sell that, if your son did this, if your aunt is, it was that.
So, I dont´like that, well. I said, no, I can´t be on this issue.
Mhm, mhm.
So, I keep working, and I help you, but no, I did not get into, you know, to run for nothing. That I don´t have anything to struggle, but I don´t like the, the
And, specially, I find
Mhm.
specially in the republican party. The democrat is a little more, he has a little bit more of,
yes.
of, of this, for the Hispanics, but, the republicans are kind of racists. They are more for, for them.
Yes, yes, that is. Uh, me that, I agree with that. Yes, that, maybe for the same thing that they are, I don´t know.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello. Em, so Nicole, speaking from New York.
I'm Laia, from Philadelphia.
Hello, how are you?
Good, and you?
Good.
Very good.
Em.
Well, we have to talk about, about politics, right?
About politics. We spoke earlier, or no?
What?
I think we spoke earlier.
Yes?
Yes. Are you from Spain?
Yes. Yes, have we talked? Ah, very well. Uh, uh, uh.
Ah, yes. We talked earlier, eh, em, eh, it's ah, a student, in the university over there, right?
I'm studying at a university in Pennsylvania, here in Philadelphia.
Now. Now I remember. Good, let's talk about politics.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Very well.
what do you think, like, like, like a, a student from another country what do you think about, about politics here?
Um, I here the, well.  It surprises me, o, the fact that there are only two big parties, that people, there are, have only two options, because, well, in Spain it is really
Um.
Even, a bit chaotic no, because there are
Um
there are many more options, then,
OK.
Um, you have from more conservative parties, center, ecologists, more to the left, then
Um. Um
I for example, I am from Barcelona, then, think, there are more pro-Catalonia parties, unless, I don't know what, then
OK.
Of options more or less, I mean, more or less bigger, you have even six, just about, and then, if you start counting the little parties, you can have up to twenty
Um. Look.
but that they have, then, representation in parliament normally there are, um, six parties,then.
Look, look
But here, it is, it is one, it surprises me no, that it is, like that, white or black.
Of course
And, and.
Of course.  Of course, and sometimes they are not so different.
yes, that is the problem, in addition, that is the problem  Because well if there were
Gray, and gray. Bad, and worse.
Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sometimes they're not so different and you can feel, you can feel a bit without representation, no, almost
Yes. Erm. Yes, yes, there are small parties which have a very different point of view to others but they don't have,
Erm, erm. Erm, erm.
They don't have enough support.
Sure.
And they don't have enough money,
Erm, erm. Erm, erm.
Erm,so really there are two parties.
Erm, erm. Erm, erm.
So, when you, I mean, always during the elections, erm, when you vote here, erm, they specify all parties, even the small ones, erm, uh, when you vote, but, the others, it's such a small percentage.
Erm, erm. Erm, erm. Erm, erm. Erm, erm. Sure.
Just once during the, during the presidential elections there was a, a, a man who stood, stood as an independent party
Erm, erm.
he's, uh, Ross Perot, uh.
what, what's his name?
Perot? P-E-R-O-T
Oh right, yes, yes, yes, that was a man, erm
That was a few years ago, and yet he, I mean, he won many, many votes, but
yes. Erm.
Not enough to win,but
Um,um,um,um.um
I do not know, he was a very,very rich man.
yes, no he was a multi millionaire,yes
And sure. Is eh he could be an ideal person with another prespective typically it can not.
yes,yes well and even there were at the end there were such
I couldn't.
Nader or Naser or,or something like that Ral-Ralph.um
Um Ah,yes Nader,Nader,yes also is.
But sure running him out is also little. throw your vote in the trash can, no because you know that. that really no,it will not paint anything.
sure,sure it is one or is is to say something simbolic.
Um,yes,yes,yes
But not to really vote for him, because no he will not win, one knows that same as he
yes Um,um,Um.um.
eh,he has many ideas very,very good ideas in my opinion but
Uh uh.
I would not vote for him simply because,it matters to me who
Sure,sure.
who will really be President,
Sure,the,the thing in Spain is that ah yes vote,don't know well,votes for a very small party
Um
but that, after the, in any case it is important, because you know with the alliances that are made, if no party has absolute majority well really a small party can be very decisive and very important to say who, who is the boss, this, well, has happened many times
Of course. Um.
and history then, I mean that, it is not a matter of saying, ah, how is  small party well I don't vote because it is not going to help at all because it is
yes that can really help, because of course in this system here, really it is a
Of course.
One or the other, no?
No, it is always Republicans and Democrats, always.
yes, yes, yes. yes.
I mean
Um
and, since history has been like this, I mean many years ago there were other parties, but
Um, um.  Um, um
at least, the last hundred years
Of course
it has been like that
Of course, and it is a lot to break this dynamic, and also
Um.
Well, with all the money that is needed, no, to present, and campaigns, and
Um.  yes, and what do people think in, in Spain, or what do you think you, about about, about things that have happened here, with the elections.
so close, and, and, counting the, the, the votes and all that mess?
Ah. yes, yes, well, I, I remember the, the first ones that Bush won.  Really people were very much surprised, no, of, first this very complicated voting systems, no, with the little holes, and I don't know, and that
Um. Um. Yes.
that really there was so much, so much confusion no, in the
Um.
it would be, well, the biggest, most stable democracy, and mor than I know
Of course, of course, it is like the only
but
because in this country, we send people, to other countries to watch elections, to see that they are legal.
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
and, at, at the same time, our same election, it is, it is such a complex thing and it is difficult to understand
yes, yes, yes.
and really, in the end no, I know, that election, in the year
In two thousand.
I mean, that was in the year two thousand
yes.
that election, it was a thing like like in the end it was like, almost a paid thing, or a thing by
yes, it was, it was very strange, the truth, the truth
through connections, because Bush, Bush's brother, he was the
Um, um.
the governor of, of Florida, like, like it all was a matter of, as- as if it was
yes, yes.
as if it was happening in another place.
Yeah, I was very surprised that, that Al Gore didn't insist more, eh, no, that he didn't protest a bit more, no, because it was all so, so strange, so obscure, that
Um, yes. yes.
That I don't know, I was surprised that he withdrew so quickly, that I don't know, well, no but if, I don't know, I don't know, I don't understand that
Um.
Uh. Uh, well.
yes, yes, me too, I also saw it that way, like, how could, how could he say, ouch, that's it
Hm, yes, and I suppose that things would have gone very, eh, differently, no, yes
Eh. Um. Um.
but, well, eh, yes.
yes, yes, there was another, another history, now, I mean
yes, yes, yes.
imagine, five years later
Um, um.
all that things that have happened.
And nothing, the, and the lat- and the latest ones too, it a bit tri-, well I don't know, I was very sad because I thought that there would really be a change, no, and that people
Um. Yes, me too, me too. The last time really
there would be
the first time, felt very, very an, very angry, i, like, like people really
um, um. Um, um
most voted for gore and they selected bush anyways, and i felt angry, and the second time, felt sad.
Um, um. Um, um. Um, um. Um, um. Yes, yes , yes
because people voted for bush
yes, yes, yes, yes. i mean, the second time is indisputable, i mean. um
like, how they were to vote again, after all what had happened
Um
I thought, what country is this, i mean, who they were voting?
Uh, uh. yes, yes
i don't know, i don't know
Because, you can vote, here
of course, well, i voted, but
you, you vote?, i mean, you are an American citizen, i mean
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I am an American citizen. i mean, i was born here
of course, um, um, um, um. Ok, ok, ok.
So, but i don't know, the system needs to change, I think
Um, um, um
because, well, well, the government must also change. but the voting system is very
um
It's very unjust, because they go by state
Um, um, um
It shouldn't be this way, shouldn't be that the majority wins
Clearly,
Period
Clearly, yes yes yes
Or, to go by states, this gives a lot of power to the smaller states
Clearly, clearly, yes yes. At least, a good thing that you have is that there are only two terms of office per president, so at least the next time, good, equal is worse than Bush, but, good, I doubt it, no?
Um.
Yes, there, this is good, because in Spain there is no limit
Um.
And I don't know if it perpetuates itself in the power for years and years
Clearly
And well, also it's good that there is relief of
Clearly, yes yes yes, I agree with that, because every eight years, they are eight years, and well, it's like enough time
Clearly, no even though eight, yes, already they have been able to to enough, yes yes
We will see what happens next time, I don't know
Yes, is it already known who will be the Democratic candidate?
No, not yet. It's very early still, because that
Yes, yes, yes
that is going to happen in the two thousand year
in two thousand year, in the eight
eight, you mean, the campaign will begin with two thousand seven, you mean two years ago
mmm
but until now, no i don't know
but i don't believe that kerry is going back to subnmit no?
no
i mean
no kerry, really no he wasn't a strong candidate
oh
really the democrats need someone more charismatic, with more personality
oh
with more, with a message very clear to the people
oh
to watch this, today in day, i don't know how was before, but today you need have message very clear to the people in the politics, because the people
sure now
it confused very quickly and how they don't have very much attention, like they dont have much interest
oh
so you'll have to have a message like that simple
yes some times you stay with the more superficial and by a little, you start to have something good
That clear, and the people thinks, the things they listen, but they believe only the things that are simple and clear.
uhm, uhm.
Like the people do not want to hear a lot with lots, explanation,much complicated thing, as one will lose them.
uhm,uhm,uhm.
as there is to say the things in  very direct form and in a form that it can be understood like, without doubt.
yes,yes,yes.
And I believe that Kerry was too smart maybe.
Now, it had an air like,pretentious, no, sometimes to know too much.
uhm,uhm
And maybe this, I saw it few times it came to philadelphia, to make a pair of meetings.
uhm.
And,uhm, to me, his message I believe, that he said intelligent things, but that isnt, finished to reach to the people, that did not finish of....
uhm
Of that, to have sufficient charisma.
yes,yes, and Gore was worst yet. that Gore was so intellectual.
uhm,uhm now, now.
That the people were not able to hear.
now,now,now.
did not understand, it felt like distant, wierd, cold.
uhn,uhm, also on the contrary, no, is like, or pretend to be, like one more, an uncle, good, I`m like us, yes.
Sure. Sure. Sure, a neighbor. The men that lives in, in the same clock from us, like
yes, yes, yes. yes, that is the paper that he plays. That in the fact is not, because to see his family, is a, well, that has a lot of money, and is a, to start and I mean that,
A sure.
That no, Is not another of us, we can say, but is the
Sure. I think that he is also very intelligent
N-
I think that he appears to be stupid.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
As to convince to the people that he is not dangerous.
Um, um. Um, um.
Like that, that is like that.
But is all the opposite, yes, yes, yes.
I think that is intelligent, or if he isn't intelligent, at least the people in his government is smart.
Um, um. Um, um.
Because they do a lot of stuff, not like, no for coincidence, I mean
Um, um. Um, um. Um, um.
Is not past all the things without a plan.
Sure, sure.
So.
Um, and Hilary Clinton that looks, like candidate?
Ah, I like her, ah, eh, I like her, but, it's going to be tough.

Why for ? What pri
Yes, because
Why for ? What do you thin of religion that could be someone uh, very angry ?
Right, for, for me the people, i mean all the world believes in it's, it's religion, no. But you have different individuals,
different persons um, in distinct part of the world, like the Chinese, and the, the Muslims, Buddhists and the Catholics, the
Yes yes
there are diferences, you know because not everyone has the same nursing
Oh yea exactly, yes
Then who, who is one to say and decide which religion is better than the other.
I'm more liberal, it's a word, liberal, in my beliefes in God.
Good, but people are getting well armed. You're attacking, you're attacking their religion, you know.
Yea
It is
exactly, yes
it's a topic to talk about, let me tell you
Because it is your religion ?
Because I am a catholic too, but, you know, when I was little my mom always took me to the church. But, I already got married in a catholic church eighteen years ago.
Oh yes ? is that true ?
yes, everything, but for me it's like there are many problems that became harder
Hm mm
in the catholic church, you know
yes
with enough money, one puts as much money as they can, that's hard you know, everyone works hard for their money
exactly
For a donation, for a donation to the church that can help other people, the people that are poor
and they are helping each other, from one to another, they help themselves because all the money that the families are giving, to shut-
Hm mm
you know that money you know
Yes
and there are millions, millions of dollars
E- Oh, I see, true?
No
That's a lot of money
yesh, I mean up here where we are it arrived over there in like I see, I am I live near Massachusetts

And, and all the problems that are in it, in the Massachusetts church, the Florida church, the New York Church, there are many many cures
That that they involve with many youth?
Hm mm
And, and already for thirty years, it rose its church and knew of the priests who had problems oh and if you had a problem
Hm mm
they paid the family to be quiet. You know and
Really?
Yeah, and all that money came out from the collection fee. All of the money came from the church and was millions and millions of dollars
Wow.
Two hundred thousand, a hundred thousand
How many, how many sent them?
you know
Of, each person, like
It depends, or is
twenty percent, of your income?
um, including the, the, the, the people who go to church?
Well For example, I think in certain re- religions,in the bible it says that you have to um, donate abouttwenty percent, I think.
No,
of, or, or ten percent of your income.
I am sorry for your salary, already. But
like  , yea

m -have cures and know that, or is, because the wholeworld has your name on the envelope, and that is not, you only gave, twenty dollars this week.
You have to give thirty-two dollars.  No, you make, six hundred and fifty dollars minus tax
Yes

The mormons. They go to the church like three or four days or every day of the week, yes.
Well yes. When I was young I went to a catholic school and we went to the church every day.
Wow.
Yes, but
I thought that some of the catholic churches were more, uh well no, they did not sent me so I did not go so far. As once every week.

Mmmhmm, exactly.
Then one prayed more, it was more by the person than by the church.
Mmhmm.
These days it's more for the church than for the person.
Ahh, yeah.
You know this is key, you want to go to church so that you can help the church.
Exactly.
You know, instead of the business being left behind this and the other, to help you, and everybody is just going backwards, you know, but honestly,
The church is for here, for the youth, you know, for the people.
Mmmhmm.
To help you, you know, to show you where to go, in your life, you know.
Yep.
And, and they only want to help those that help them, the ones who give them donations here want food, and want time.

yes that she's going to turn two years old and still I don't know which language she's going to speak.
oh now I see but it's good that they learn a second language, no
I think so
for example yes they're going to have many advantages when they're here when they grow up and they go to university
yes aha
and for example it can be like what I do here, here I am TA
mhm
I came from Colombia to this university to do eh, Spanish teaching assistant
mhm
and in that way
mhm
you can do grad- go to graduate school like graduate studies
oh, yes
or post graduate studies and they pay everything. Do you understand when they give you a teaching assistanceship?
yes
and they help you and if you speak Spanish you can teach Spanish and in that way pay for your masters
aha
and your doctorate and it's very good
yes, so if you speak very good English as well, right.
no, no I'm ju- just learning
no
an my friends laugh at me, but
oh

yes, it is what they say
yes
but I don't know I believe that maybe had to find someone who is able to talk more or less because
yes, yes because I did send an e-mail to the person in charge and told me he is going to find some native people
aha
to speak and say the message
oh
which is very good, no
yes, the other time there was a I don't remember what we had to talk about, but also I didn't understand anything
