what is important is, I believe, that God exists.  No?  And what,
Aha.
you cannot do things alone.
Aha.
And, well, and that, even though it is not seen,
Mmh.

And that he is there, yes.
But, aha, continue.

Well, I think, well, I am Catholic.
yes.
I, I believe in God a lot, but no, I don't practice the, to go to the, to the, to church every day, every day, every day.
Aha.
Because, I was taught since I was little, my dad,
yes.
no, he made us, he made us kneel, around the bed,
mmh.
and there all, am, my dad, my mom and all my siblings- and my siblings,
yes
we asked Father God for us, for all our family.
Mmh.
And my dad always taught us that, that for you to be, to believe in God, you don't have to be involved with a church.
Of course.
Ah, but I have an uncle who is a Christian
Aha, yes
but, he is, he is in Puerto Rico.
yes.
But, often when I go to Puerto Rico, he wants me to change religion to their orthodoxy, because they say that orthodoxy
yes, yes
It's a, um, it's a religion that, how is it? That you can,in other words, that women can, wear pants, with fans, that reveal the skin
Uh-huh
that they paint
OK
Well, he says that this isn't good
uh-huh, yes
That, well, that we catholics are really liberal, not like the Christians that put their
yes
In other words, the woman puts on her suit, or her skirt and bouse
OK
and long skirt, not cut off, and not screened, and not painted
yes, yes
Well, but my uncle is religious.
yes
And I don't believe that
Yes, uh-huh
That the same God, that the same God that he worships is the same one that we also worship
Un-huh, yes. Let me tell you something,
Aha.
here in Barranquilla, in Colombia, where I am from,
Aha.
There is the same little problem also.
Aha.
But, it happens that, am, at home, we go to church,
Aha,
eh, well, we talk and all, and we got to the conclusion
Aha
that in that aspect, women are beautiful.  No? And, they have to dress up, because they are not going to go like that all the time.
Aha, Aha.  Natural, aha, aha, aha, aha.
Exactly.  Then, in that sense,
Aha.
yes, there are, there are people who get bother a lot.  Then, they look to the other as less than other people.
Aha, aha, aha, aha.
And, they look at you like you are weird. But, I don't pay attention, because, and more, my sisters, I have two sisters,
Aha.
and then dress up very beautiful, and they are young, they dress up beautifully.
Aha. Aha. Aha
So no, yes, but there are people who do get bothered a lot.
uh huh.
Some times they don't greet anyone
Hmm
Or, but no, but yes.   They have their manner of thinking and they are, sometimes, like very stubborn.
Uh huh
So, why not, it's not, it is as I say.
Hmmm
but fine.  One must
But, also in the schoo- in the Catholic Church aslo.  I remember when my children were small
Yes
for, I took them to the church
Uh huh
and we were waiting what came out, it, it, it, the first, the first turn that him, that him, touched the people that, American
Uh huh
we were waiting.  And, behind me, there was a Hispanic lady
Hmm
that was speaking about if the lady would be leaving, if she believed that she was going to a party, and if her clothing would be very
very colorful to go to a church, and her shoes were very high, that is she was so fixed up, it seemed that
yes
that she was going to, to a party that didn't seem to be in a church.
yes, yes.
And I looked at her and said,
yes
How would she be talking of that if she loves God?
Sure. You have groom yourself to attend, you have to look good, as if you were going to a party, really,
Aha. Aha.
it has nothing to do with God, nothing like that. Ah, when you go to church, you have to look nice.
Aha, aha. Aha, aha, aha.
All dolled up.
But it's not to, so that you use that to gossip about the others, if you are going to church
Exact- Exactly
You are not supposed to gossip about other people.
Exactly, yes.
But, she was like, I looked to here and said, wow, my God, if she talks like this here, how does she
yes.
talks if she sees a woman in the street, showing her body
yes.
Ah.
Weird, and,
Aha.
I was going to say, were you sir born in Puerto Rico ?
yes, I was born in Puerto Rico and I grew up there.
Mhm. Mhm
and I got here in the United States when I was about eighteen or nineteen years old. Aha.
Yes, Wow. And the-

Oh, you are young. My mother has twe- eh.
Yes
she's going to be fifty years old in this november.
Oh, yes ?
yes, and I'm going to be twenty-seven years old.
Oh. Almost as old as my son.
in November too, yes, then those are the things that one thinks about when he's coming, for example, in the United States
Aha, aha
as, trying to seek something, a better future for one's kids. No ?
Aha aha, yes yes yes.
Then, that's where we're at over here. I am
Uh um.
working as a teacher, Spanish teacher assistant.
Right.
But I'm also looking at what are the chances of going to school, to get a masters
Oh, that's good, that's good.
Yes, or, or trying to find. Because, well, you can live at home and everything, but
Right.
Well, if you can take advantage here, it's not bad.
Right, right, right. But no, in, in our countries it's not the same than here.
Uh um.
There's a lot of poverty and not so much work.
Yes, madam.
And here there isn't, you can get a job anywhere.
Uh um.
But, but family, since my family stayed there in Puerto Rico, i have my mom there, my brothers
Uh um, Right.
My nephews. And every now and then i go to see them.
Right.
But, but I'm not going to live there in Puerto Rico, because i have my two children here.
Ah, yes.
Though they are older already, but they still live with me.
yes, yes.
Until they get married, and each of them has a job and their, and their, and they go live with their wives and their husbands,
Mmh
eh, no, it cannot, I cannot go there to Puerto Rico, without worrying.
Ah.  That's great, and then, your, eh, your siblings are in Puerto Rico?
In Puerto Rico, yes, yes
Ah, and how did you come here first?
Ah?
Did you come to- on vacation here?
No, I came to live, I went to Florida with my mother and my young siblings.
Aha.
And from floria, I came here to Chicago with my mom and my young siblings too
yes.
Then, my mom moved to Puerto Rico,
Mmh.
and my young siblings went to Puerto Rico.  Then, I stayed here, and since I got married, I stayed here.
yes.  Aha.
But, my mom was coming and going.  But, my mom doesn't like it here because of the cold.
Yes, eh, yes, I have heard that Chicago is pretty cold
But no, and she says that it's better that she is here placed in four corners, and in Puerto Rico she can be leaving and entering the house.
Yes
it's not the same
Clearly. And so her mom is in Puerto Rico now?
En Puerto Rico
Great
But my mom is Catholic and my aunt is Catholic
Yes
Mi uncle is Christian, he goes and reads the bible and my mom
Yes. Mhm.
And he talks a lot of father God, and he asks my mom questions about God, and my mom responds
Yes, mhm.
But he doesn't like it because my mom, after my grandfather died my mom took out her eyebrows,
Mm.
made holes in her ear to put on earrings
Mhm
She shaved her legs, put on pants, put on dresses
Yes
And my grandfather, and my papa, and my uncle, they didn't like
Mh. oh.
because he says that women should not use pants
yes,
because of their religion, in his religion
Is, he is the brother, he is brother of your
of my mother
mother, right?
He says, that, that, woman should not use pants because the pants were made for men.
mm, yes, yes
But, my uncle, is very, very, very, how is it? religion fanatic
yes
He has a religion, very at heart, like he
yes
but, one thing yes, he does not tell his children to get in the religion
mhm
Only to, to my mother, and his sisters, his nieces, his newphes. But his own children does not say anything.
Ah. Mh. Mhm.
So then, am, that's why, oh, I say to him, that, that, he, to believe in God, you do not have to be seven days a week in church
of courses. Madam.
but, he is seven days a week in church.
Yes.
He is, Saturday, he says he's going to the church from the early morning,
Hmm.
Until the night, and all day Sunday in church.
Wow.
So, he's really fanatic about the church.
Yes.  yes, ma'am.
I have a friend, she's Christian, and she only, she says she goes to the church
Hmm, yes.
Saturday and Sunday.
Of course.
But, my uncle goes seven days a week.
Ah, yes.
And he's always talking about God, God, over here, God over there.
Hmm.
I, I always, when I go to Puerto Rico, I tell him,
Mm.  Hmm.
God, he's buy our side twenty four hours a day.
Of course.
I tell him, you don't have to go to church to talk to God, because even in your own bed, you can talk with God.
yes mam
It's unique that, that one can't continue asking father God alone How is it? We only remember father God when we have problems and not all of the time.
Eh is is
But there are some people that
yes
ay My God that grants me to be, ay my God that es but when we are good, that we don't have problems
Mhm
well I don't believe that father God exists
I see
Hi?
Hi, Milgred from Connecticut
It's Mercedes, from Florida
How are you, good night
Mm, good night too
Hm
Let's see what we can talk about religion then
Do you believe that join or disjoints, or?
Hm
Or do you believe that if everybody were the same religion we will be better, or be equal, or it will be
Mm, i believe that, i, what i believe is that, that
thw world will be better?
somebody being the same religion that all we be the same religion it's imposible, because i think that always are going to be diferences, eh, cultural
Yeah, yeah
And that always is going to make that each person interprets that, unique religion at it's own way
Yeah, yes, i believe it is, it's the same, and as not having, all we aren't the same race So the, each race has it's own
it's doctrine, own, or and, and although we are Hispanic some of us adquire another that in, eh, sometimes aren't, neither,  i mean, , sometimes some of us are a catholic family, and others in the family are
adventists or they are um, or evangelical
Hm mm
or they are from this others, the ones of the taballas, the ones who sells, uh, oh what's their name, the l- i forgot their name
But, they are, I mean, They are a lot, there are a lot of races, and religions.
Hmm mm
But, um, to me, I don't get bothered with other religions. I share with any other religion as long as they don't try to, to put me in in something I don't want,  do you follow me?
Exactly, not including you.
right, not being fanatics right.
they oppose it, don't feel forced, right
yeah
Talking to you okay, I mean, I think that, it's that eh, what is it called , um the, that the religion is separated because of difference.
well, in which one believes, the, the differences always exist.
Yeah, religion is like politics.
Exactly.
that depending of, of what point you look at it, well not the whole world will be in agreement, follow me?
Hm mm that is why they say that one should never discuss religion. Not because, for that, I can't believe they put us to discuss religion in this show.
Hm mm, yea. But it's good, it's good that, they discuss everything, because if you look at it, I have aunts and cousins who  belong the evangelic religion.
Hmm
And the rest of them are Catholics.
Hm mm
and in the, in the other side of my family, there are some who are absenteeism.
Hm mm
but when we reunite, no one is talking of religion, an no one is talking about, you know, that you have to be this way, and you have to change, nothing.
And my cousin's husband is an evangelical, you will almost always find him in the church. And she does not belong to the church. And they have a happier marriage than most.
And she, she only there on special occasions, mostly for ceremonies for mother's, when she is involved
but they celebrate that, because they do not celebrate Christmas, but there are also other times
Who are they?
the evangelicals.
Okay
Aha, yes, the evangelicals. So my cousin's husband says that he was not married by that religion, but they did get married at the church.
Hm
And she dances, and she drinks, and he accompanied her to work and to the party, where there was a present
you haven't told anybody, ah, you still have to stop smoking, and you have to quit drinking protein.
if you make jokes of you at the party, rather than getting cranky, you know that this is not a big deal so you should just have a good time
Yes, you can get a person like that, it all depends on the person. but if they become fans, forget about it.
This is what happened in my house
that is
hey, my mom is that religious
Aha
And my dad did not believe in church. He never said why.
Aha, that is like my cousin as well.
but all of us went to Catholic school.
Oh really?
yes, then how that n- we had well, of the, always Christians, well, but
Uh huh
eh, we had, eh or that is, that which we learned in school, we didn't reinforce at home.
Uh huh
And now yes, I think that my, of my sisters, only the oldest is Catholic still. My younger sister, eh eh,  think that she's Evangelical, and I no, I have decided that I do not have religion
That is, you're not going to church or anything.
Mm, no.
No
Uh huh No
I am going to the church, but no, I'm not with, that which they call a pious woman, stuck there all the the church, no.
Hmm mm Hmm mm, not I, since I was married of that I went out, I went to the university, and I left the university, I already decided that I wasn't going to return to the
to a church, no, not me, no, the truth that interesting, eh, to me the, the organized religion, no, no
You don't like it.
no, no, exac- not that I don't like it but no, I don't feel the necess- that is, well I feel that God, I keep Him in my heart.
Uh huh
And, so it's like I live my life well. Eh, but let's say and then now, I married my husband he's Jewish, and my son is Jewish too, and we're going to bring him up Jewish.
Uh huh
Because I do believe that one needs to gro- eh to grow up with a religion.
O yes, yes, I think that it's a very important base, especially for the children.
yes yes, definitely. I
But yes, one raises them, at least with, with something, forget that they leave and, and are, what do I know, they, they become half wild, half
Hm mm
they don't have like feelings. I mean, the don't create a relationship with feelings towards anything.
Hm mm, yes
You get me? it's like they don't care about anything.
yes yes, and that's why, yes I agree that yes, yes, the, it's that the, if ne- the kids do need well. And that's why they say
And, and, and you were from, you say that you're a Christian and that, and what a miracle that eh, they accepted you in his family, seeing that, that Jews almost always
yes? yes, they are, really yes.
they are, how do you say it, are
yes, we were lucky.
only among themselves that they tr- they try to marry, and so they have the same religion.
yes, yes, it's, it's true there are, there are eh, they of course, of course they are very, strict, right?
Aha, ah
But no, my husbands family have always been very understanding. Also the other son got married, the girl, she's not either eh
Jewish, and I think I imagine that maybe, yeah, I was the second one, they didn't
But did you get marries by the Jewish, or did you get married by the Catholics?
No, we had a religious, an Jewish ceremony.
Oh, how nice, ah, yes, aha.
yes, and let's say, and then is what I'm saying, my son is going to be raised and I say it's important that he's raised with a religion.
Hm mm
When he is already an adult, then he will decide what he wants to do.
And what did they say, aha.
True, if I want to go, or, if he wants.  I don't know, stop being, be another thing, whatever, but I do believe that, whatever religion it is, a child must be raised with the defined religion.
The, my youngest girl, the one that is bigger are, are, they got baptized and are Catholic, but the youngest, though she was baptized in the catholic church, she also visits the church
the Evangelical church.
Hm mm
She goes with my cousin's husband, and you know, when she goes, she wears her long skit, aha, yes, you know, like she respects her, her
their religion of theirs, and eh- she, she likes going with them, and and I never told her no.  When they asked me if they could take her, and I ah yes.
You know
I don't understand that, because let's say, my mom. Eh, you see- that she when she says that, she goes to the church she goes, she has to wear a skirt.
Then, I tell her, but why is it bad to wear pants
Ah, because eh, eh, I think that the Bible says, that, pants, are worn my men, something like that.  Eh,
Yes, but but, to me, that, and that, to me that was one of the, em,
it is related with that.
reasons, really, of of eh, not get away, but from, a little of what organized religion is, any organized religion.  That there are people who when it comes to the Bible, too strict, well, they take it
Hm Those are the ones who become fanatic, that
Eh, yes
they interpret word for word, to the, to what is written, you understand.
Hm mm
It is like the, the the, those, the the Iraqis those with their doctrine that of, of craziness,  who kill people, in the name of, of
The God they had, or what they believe
Mmm
Sometimes there is people with their minds, distorted
Mmm
interpreting things that should be unifying. Because religion must unify, no matter which one. Do you Understand?, I don't think that only because two humans are from different religions they
must kill each other, because, of that belief
yes
For me, as a non fan of anything. I don't become a fan of anything. I was raised in the catholic religion
I helped at church, I belonged to the Mary's Daughter Club, I helped a lo at church
it has always been, my faith, the catholic church. I took my children to church and I baptized them, because that's how I was raised
But know, as grown ups, if they want't to go somewhere, you must understand, You cant make them not to go some church
you can't believe in that, because the catholic church says it's different, you know
Mmm
And the great amount of evangelic or Jehovah's witnesses people try to force things up to your brain. They want to come to your home early and start to sell whatever they have
And well, sometimes they knock and I thank them and say: I have your book, And if they insist I say, hey, I'm catholic and don't
And, there exist so many kind of people. I understand them
They are no prudent
Their work is to transf...well, not heir work, but they want to transform people into their religion, but they don't respect
Yes
Right?, Oh, it might be me, but
i had a lady that came look, every time i was out from the door, she came like no, look, it's for you to help us with this, buy the book, you know that
you're in sin, what do i know, but I've been a sinner since i was born my dear. so let the lord punish me when i get up ther, so
well, if they try to, i don't know, they go and say such negative things, instead of saying well look, you can know the lord better, and what do i know,
everywhere, but that about being a sinner, yes, yes i keep sinning, and you're sinning right now talking like that
Hello
Good night. How are you? With Norma here from Atlanta Georgia. Where are you from.
I am Arthur I am in, I am in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
ah, okay
Yes pleasure to meet you. Where are you from, Norma?
I am Peruvian.
Peruvian, a my, my, my roommate is Peruvian
ah,Okay. Yeah there are a lot of Peruvians around here.
from Lima yeah right, also Mexicans
ah you are Mexican
yeah I am Mexican
ah okay
From Mexico City
mhm
very good And in Georgia what do you do, study or work?
No I am, I take care of my kid, I am a housewife.
ah, okay, very good and the, your husband is, is from, also from
Peruvian, no, no my husband isn't
aha, Peruvian American
Yes my husband is American, yes aha
ah OK, ah very good
and so, what do you think about religion, about religions?
well, I think that from the times of like medieval and that
aha
religion was lost during industrialization, I mean what I want to say is that religion stopped being something spiritual
mhm
and became something more political and then lately now in the last times it has ceased to be so political but even so it still keeps bringing many of the ones that are
mhm
like the institutions so you can be very religious and spiritual
mhm
but not necessarily in favor of an institution and then maybe you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says or in favor of what is said by
some certain institution like the Jewish one, the Catholic one or the Muslim one but then maybe if you can here among the topics, mix a bit of, of the philosophies of all of them like
rather use them to follow a good path of life more than anything
mhm
and what do you think?
well I I am very religious, I belong to a religion that is the Hare Krishna religion, I don't know if you have heard of it
ah yes, yes, yes I've heard about it, never, I don't know very well how they are, what is the Hare Krishna about
mhm yes it's based on a Hindu philosophy
aha
so first we believe that you are a part or a portion of God and we also believe in reincarnation, we have rules and regulations, we're vegetarian, we don't eat meat, eggs or fish
mm, we don't drink alcohol.
and why not, why don't you eat meat, why do you think that?
because for us, we believe that, every life animal deserves respect, we have to avoid violence.
oh okay
so that's why we don't eat meat, we dont intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol.
ha
we don't drink coffee or tea.
yeah
and we don't play around
no playing around games.
no, and are you religious? are you from any religion?
and no no, i don't belong to any institution for the moment, i grew up catholic, but now I'm bigger im twenty one years old.
like at around eighteen i stopped following the institution because, i didn't have much interest in it,
and i felt that it was already in my spirit, my contact with
mhm
with not god, i didn't have to go the institution to get that, so i started to read other religions, but more than anything,
to get an interest, and lets say practice life, but
mhm
but yeah I'm not, i don't like the institutions.
but you believe in god
Yes, definitively, but
Oh, that's really nice, sometimes you don't feel connected to a group of people
exactly
but the important thing is to have God in your heart, and to develop your relation with God, that's really important
yes, precisely, knowing if it really is
a supreme being
a divinity behind everything
Of course
Sometimes, well, related to that, it has changed so much, in fact, i study chemical engineering and sometimes people think that in science you tend to
to brake religion, to currupt it
Mm, yes
But think it's re opposite, because people who starts studying this, well, this scientific things, are normally really religious, because
when they start knowing themselves, of about things, they can explain
Mmm
More questions arrive and you understand that the world is not understandable, there are miracle things all over the place and time
I feel that each time, when people knows like scientist do, and those people understands that there must be a supreme chaos, and a divinity behind everything
Of course, a supreme being which controls everything
yes
the, religion is, well, religions or the beliefs have a supreme being. It helps people being closer. In catastrophes and times of pain, then you always
ask God for help. Everyone. There are some people called atheist, and they are always desperate
They don't ask, they turn their faces like that from asking god to help them
Yes, yes, yes, that's it
It's not that, it just it's in their heart, ¿right?, you just feel that there really is a supreme being that many times doesn't.
Yeah, exactly, you don't turn to religion only to ask for help, but also to thank
Uh um, of course, uh um.
I think that many times, people become religious at certain times because they need help, but once they're ok, they forget.
yes, yes, that's why you don't, in our philosophy, there's always a future, a verse that says, not, that when you're suffering.
Yes
One always, one always asks god for help, and one should really, uh, should ask god to send more suffering because that way you remember him more
Because if not, when you're ok, you forget about your relationship with god.
Yes
And, that's true, ¿isn't it?, because, when you do fine, you're very happy.
Yes, you don't remember
No, then you think that you are in control, not that he is, that you are in control of everything that happens and that one does the work, ¿right?
Yes, yes, yes
No, but it's really that God blesses you and helps you in many circumstances.
Yes, yes, yes, true.
And, ¿do you have a, do you have a notion about reincarnation or something like that?, ¿have you heard something about karma, have you read?
Well, i have heard about karma, right, and how karma is, is, it's brought upon, right, i mean, if you had bad karma you will reincarnate in another being, but for
Uh um
to improve it, not just clean it, no that you have another opportunity to do your karma something good, more pure its not something like that
mmm yes OK the karma law is the law of action and reaction, that one person in agree of his positive or negative activities it has a reaction positive or negative
oh OK
no for that we many times said, but why there are so many things that happen to people no, although you see very good people but really are
reactions of their past lives that we realize actions very negatives and now its from the negative reaction that they are suffering
yes
no its not really that there aren't people that are very inocent or very good people its just a reaction like you have free will
not to do what we wish, God doesn't force us to believe in him, doesnt force us to serve or do devotional service for that
yes
we have our free will, and if we do negative activities many times there is a reaction of the karma law, for that nobody its free of the karma law, its infalible
yes
mmm, that's what we think it, i mean what we believe no
oh i see the hare krishna
yes in our religion
and what do you do? Do you gather with the hare krishna every week or everyday
yes i mean now i am married i live here in apparment near to the temple we have
OK
the temple here in georgia, in atlanta, but before a live in the temple, i mean i was like an internal there, i lived like i was doing service not krishna no, to God
o yes
no there are many kinds of service that we do, one is preach, one sing the name saints of Lord, one kitchen for the lord we offer food to God
and does many different activities, no
aha
not all, you do, like the center of your life is God, no, you offer him everything, all your deeds, your meals, everything you do and when you wake up in the morning you go to the altar and pray
and offer him our food, so now I'm married and I have kids so I have to take care of them
sure
but I do, I always go to the temple and we are devout. Many people come on Sundays or in big celebrations that we have during the year.
mhm
ah okay. Do you have something like a prophet, like Jesus Christ, how's that?
well, we have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada Ace Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, he is a devout of God, he brought this knowledge to the West
aha
no, he's not, we really don't honor him
What's his name again?
well, he respect Jesus Christ too, it's because we respect other religions, other beliefs.
yes sure
sure, he brought that knowledge to the West, about this ideas of Krishna, as we call it, we name it after the city
ah okay
mhm
What's the name of the man again?
mhm
What's his name?
is called international society for the conscience of Krishna
oh okay, okay, but What's the name of the man that brought you?
ah, his name is Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
okay, is of Hindu origin or Where does he come from?
aha yes he, he was born in India
oh, okay
Well, he is no longer in the planet, no, he already died and abandoned his body
an okay, but, then, or rather, it is very possible that has reincarnated in someone else or he wont reincarnate because it has Karma.
No, or rather he is devoted, he is considered a pure devoted to God, and he returned to the spiritual world.
Oh, okay, so then he will no long reincarnate
no, no, he will no longer reincarnate because he reached the goal in life in this world, in this material world is where you develop your devotion to God
Yeah
and to not get back to the spiritual world and from the spiritual word you can't can't come back to this material world to experience the cycle of birth, sickness and death that all of living things go through
yes, exactly
no, even the animals and humans being
okay, of course
no
and so then, then he has already passed that level and he no longer reincarnates
nn yeah,
okay
yes, he passed that level, he is already a pure devoted
oh, very interesting
I don't know if it's very interesting, it would be great if you not interested could
and  how long have you been in this religion?

oh is during the week when there's a teacher but that's only if you need help right?
of course and one week you told me you had an exam like Friday or something like that
so yes, yes Friday I have an exam so I was studying and I also have, I have several things this week, Friday I also have a homework for
some math classes I'm taking and I also have um eh I'm taking a marketing class and I also have another, another homework so
mm a little bit of each
oh in a week yes I have a busy week but at least I have
yes you know
all these two days yes, free yes
we are reaching the end of this program, I believe, because I believe, How many calls do we have? I think that we are close right?
Me? No yet Many nights I am busy and I can not then
ah
I only, I have only twelve, thirteen, yes
ahh Okay, I cancel it, I had it a few days ago, but only for about three days or so and now I am about twenty or so
ahh if it is because of that I want to speed up because I know that soon
you chiii
some people are going to stop doing that
the issue is going to pass, but some people are starting now
ahh
I talked to a person and told me that this is my first call, a boy from Peru
m
who btw is at the same university in Pennsylvania
ahh
and studies, student of history, history
ahh, yes nearly everybody...
what what
...knows somebody in the university or they study  in the university because
that's how it is
but I don't know how you are going to know about that
yes wait a second that someone is knocking at the door and I have to open, one moment please
OK yes of course, of course
hello sorry well about four minutes went by
yes, yes, yes it doesn't matter
it is that they never open when I want them to open
not this but but it seems to me that this program they have had several problems with the computers that or the, or I don't know with with the gadgets really that call
yes, aha
that they record because it happened to me several or two times it happened to me that I was in the middle of the conversation and suddenly it cut out
to me like three or I don't know then I sent them an e-mail to this Shudong, Shudong I don't know what.
mmm, mmh yes Shudong yes
and it answered me and told me that that there were several people with that
yes
with that problem, then another e-mail came from her saying that they had told her there were participants who don't speak Spanish very well
yes those
aha and to hang up that when
yes Shudong
ahh
yes Shudong tells you just hang up but that is embarrassing but I don't know.
I they don't - only one lady from New York that doesn't speak much Spanish but I've talked to her twice, I laugh a lot because
ah
her name is Erdestina, have you talked to her?
mm,mm
Ernestina and since I'm Josefina, we laugh
ah
and I tell her oh Ernestina, Josefina and then
yes
we laugh a little and she tells me about her family
But is she American or?
I don't know because I think that the other day I spoke to someone that lives in her house and they told me she was from an island
is not Grenada but is an island from
mm
from the Caribbean that has a special language and, something like that
ah and not necessarily Spanish
yes, but regardless she understands, well yes if one
yes yes yes
if you explain it well she understands, look and this about the e-mail Have you bought? with You haven't requested?
no never, never, well what I have is that in my account because I have two accounts one is hotmail and another in
in the university and in the university they hardly ever send me
no,
like that unsolicited mails but in Hotmail it is terrible all, all days I receive
ah
twenty, twenty-five messages and all trash but
aha that you won this, that you put like they arrive via -msn I have - MSN
mmh
then that Josefina was rewarded with this that press here you have a free scholarship and you have I don't know
ah
and a trip, uh and cruises and
eh yes
and I delete them because those are to know
yes
if you answer not for
yes the, the sad thing is that with but because what they do people who send all those emails is that they have, they put, ah they create programs
they go through the internet from website to website then when they find
mmh
a an e-mail address
ah
they put it on a list and then yes
I tell you and how they find out so much about you, no?
yes yes then and they also go to the news group and go to
such a weird people
To the all all all and then it is easy that or or for instance the directories, or for instance the hotmail directory, I think that there too
they look for names and look and then they create a huge list
wow
and then with that list they make a message right? and then they send it to everyone in the list but, is that so, the amount of work needed is so little, so little right?
mhm, mhm
And if two, or three people answer from the thousands they already earned enough money for for whatever
to cover the expenses right?
yes yes that is sad that, is that
o but it is
with two or three fools they already, already molested all of us right?
Oh, but that is horri-horrible because I left it a bit controlled by the filter of downloading that that I do not know, they installed there a spam filter
mhm
I asked for it, I did not bought it, but they installed it from -msn no
mm
I believe that filters a little but not always the junk where it says junk this appears, like ten or twelve a day right?
yes it always happens that if I read an article that looked interesting to me that that Microsoft what wants to do know is that it is making something like that, a software that does that
am that that one time I sent a message to the computer that it has to make like a, something I do not know that has to break a code or do some task so it is not
very very large
aha
But it will be required like this a little of work.  really?Then if one is sending e mail, write one e mail and I will send it, no-one will not even notice.right?
so
And also when, also when the computer do the task, then break the code exactly, then do that also in microsoft, will give you a certificate to the e mail.
That, that the person took a little of time to make that. right? Then if only one is sending 2 e-mails it does not matter then the e mail will arrive and will know that is not spam, but if one is sending millions of e mails.
mhm
One, one, do not have the computer, don't have the strength like this the processor cant make a lot of work. Right?
aha
Sending so many e mails, then it will delay more and possibly what is waiting is going to delay so much that I believe it will be too much.
Slow and they wont be able to send all the e mails that is being sent now a day.
ah
At the moment, when some one receive an e mail without the certificate, one knows that is a spam it can be thrown away.
Or it needs to bring like a file or attachment or something like this that says...
yea, yes I don't know exactly.
If you want to open this e mail, something like this you said...
No exactly what it is, but I think is a good idea.
aha, mine has I say, to me, they made it,because when I send by yahoo because I have one mail, one division.
mhm
In yahoo and sometimes when I`m going to send an e mail, it ask me one,um to identify something that is decoded, needs to be decoded no...
mm
says this is to protect
yes
messages something like this
yes, yes
so then, put the pieces together, the the letters how they go
yeah
but sometimes, is a  P, R, J
mhm
tea and a number and something like that
and the numbers yes
you had seen it, it is not like a crossword, like a puzzle, no?
yes I had seen them, yes mhm, mhm
I don't know if that what is
yes, I don't know, don't know
to protect
but I think that the filters were not to Efficient right because if you think that that each time that you put like you can say ah well if have a
a, a, what is the suspicious phrase you can send to the spam right but many times then
ah yes
who believe in the spam they know which one are the, the the phrases that that in general activate the filters right
ohhh
then they believe the the message is the form that no
that not filter
That won't pick up the filter, yes yes then
ah and how is in the, in the forums, had you thought in the forums like the Univision or Telemundo
ahhh yes once and a while
and when you write a word like stupid or idit this won't Be collect, no? Or it will said we don't permit that type of vocabulary
ay interesting
Hellw, how are you?
Aodri, Hi, how are you?
Ver well, I am Miguel Angel, and I'm in Philadelphia, and you?
I, my name is Aodri and I'm in New York
you're in New York, mhm, are you? from Argentina, don't tell me
No, I'm Peruvian
Ah, I'm sorry!, because you had the "cho" you know, like you have the New "chor", well I thought, I mean, this one is Argentinean
You are not the first person, don't worry
Ah, OK, OK
But tell me
how do ? what did you say your name is
Odri
Atri?
Aodri
Ah, oh, oh Odri, like Odri
Yes, yes exactly, exactly
That's goo, that's good, very good
Well, what you think of unsolicited mail?
what do I think of unsolicited mail, well that it's a mess
yes
that I throw it in the trash immediately
No, yes, I ohm
when it arrives
To me that, when I open my e-mail and I see a lot.  When I see that it makes me, ay I say, ay this!  because some times it tells me like
it makes my nerves
Five, nine messages and I want to see who has written and I see there are five new and four
yes yes
They directly to the trash
mm Well and from, and the email is a scandal, the spam
No, yes but the good thing is that for example, the service I use for the mail
Which one do you use? Yahoo?
what is it called.  No I use gmail.  Then
oh, Gmail yes, yes
yes, they can and you can assign
mmh
that like they like I don't know how they do it, but they have a way of of verifying that like it is spam And it, they put it in another folder
mmh
Then ah, it works, no I am going to say that ninety percent of the time it works very well
yes yes I have, yes it is true, I have Yahoo and also, and also spam it puts it in a different folder and
yes
And if you don't want to read it don't do it, don't, don't read it if you don't want it
yes, mm, I think
mm yes, no, that is true
I believe that most of of the services of the technical of mail have that now because is Is like an invasion because they try in any way to put
words like it was a conversation, and it is not only in English because I'm going to tell you that
Oh, no, no
I also receive too much in Spanish eh,
yes, yes, yes
my personal mail and my work mail also I receive too much, too much, too much
mm, yes I also the Spanish I, look I have been living in Spain okay, until the last week, I only have one year here you know in the United States
And okay in Spain it is the same I mean there is also too much spam I don't know, no, there doesn't matter the language , so, that is already international
Bad things get to anywhere in no time ah,
Then you never have bought nothing from a spam
Oh, I have bought, I've bought stuff in internet, I mean I've bought books in amazon And I've bought tickets to concerts and all that kind of things, but it has been always because my own initiative, you know that
eh, if I want to buy a book, or I want to buy some cd or I want to buy some ticket for a concert or to the movies or whatever
But that's it because I wanted, never because I have received a spam and I have opened it and have bought because I don't read it directly you know I erase it
Then don't And when I receive something in my mail that I have not asked for it, the same, I send it to the trash directly, you know I don't even read it
And sometimes so Man, it is also true that sometimes I read it, but mh No, generally I am never interested in it, and have you bought something?
No I don't, I don't,  but I remember that, maybe one year ago, I read an article in the newspaper about a man that
mhm
In itself, he loves buying things, stupid things
mmh.
that he lives off of that and I but, it seems to me, I have never met someone that
OK, OK,
that has bought from spam because but everyone, it makes them angry when they see that blessed spam that this, the other and I
In addition the greatest part of these things are I mean they sell you things of, that then, then they don't send them, they take your money
they send you a low-quality product, I mean, they sell you these things, they are not, that are you, they are totally because they sell you, no well they sell this look that, and then maybe once
I have met people who have bought and have said well this is shit, this is a thing that breaks in two days or
or it breaks or you know that then they are not quality things because if you say
yes
if you said well because this, this is well, it is so, it is what no, but all this is from spam, it is all everything is trash
yes, it is, it is poor taste
It is a like, it is like the yes, eh, yes.  It is like the, like the sale that of of of and all those catalogues that there are of
of really absurd things like that well one thing to scratch your back and that is a, and have you seen these catalogues of things, of stupid things, stupid?
have you seen that, I mean really stupid things
yes, yes, no, yes, you know something that
yes, that for example, a
maybe if there is a reason to have it but it is a thing like what, to spend the money because eh,
And have you seen that comes out, it is like some booties that have a plug to heat your feet, have you seen that?
yes, yes
yes, and things like that, no, that they sell you like that, goes the lady like that.  Mr with the feet well into the little boot, who
gets warm and gets warm the fee and I sometimes who is going to buy this, my mother
No but you know what I ever say, I say someone has to be buying this for them to do the way they do
Sure
And, and they put la-, laws like that, in the state of Virginia is illegal
mhm
To dens a spma, an electronic mail not requested
yes
but the same, a lot arrive, horrible ones arrive
yes
it is similar to the ones that call you by phone, ay ay, that makes me, that makes crazy, when I see
Ah, no, no, to the ones that call lby phone, yes, to those ones I directly say no
yes
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am not interested, and that's it and I hang down the phone
No, no, no,no I am not that sweet with them No, no, no, I tell them no to the thing they do with my name, take out my name immediately
So, there is one thing, I don't know if it is federal or for the state yes, it was make by our Governor and that is from a cover
And you can, can put your name and if someone calls you has to pay a penalty because it says they should not call
yes, I, I have my boss, my former boss, the thing he used to do when they called from a, one of those cards, for a raffle in the house or whatever I don't know
Eh, from the mortgage he used to say wait a moment and he left them waiting, because he said look when I have to talk to customer service of anything, a credit card, the bank or I don't know
they always put me in wait for a long time, the I love to tell them
yes,
wait and he left them there and that one thing by him, he loved doing that
OK, man, you don't know what happens also to me I feel a little sorry.  People who work in those things, it is nothing, don't laugh, but it is true,
I feel, I feel a little sorry for people who, who who have to work and make a living calling then you know treat a man, I am not interested and of course I say I am not interested and I hung up.
But I try to be a little nice because you know that people are working and making a salary calling, as telemarketers calling well it is not pleasant to them either.
that people mistreat them and insult them, that they hang up the phone, without answering, you know because I have try, I have worked, well all
I don't know, when I was younger and I was a student and that well well I had, well I continue being a student but when I was younger
Well man, and well in Summer you know you have well A, I worked as a telemarketer and no, it was not selling, no I didn't sell, I
ah
I received calls, I mean no, I didn't make calls,
yes
And I was working for a provider from in Spain and I was working also for an insurance company
yes,
And the that, it was, what is it called here, like, roadway assitance
Ah, OK, OK
And I called people who wanted stayed the car had broken down and we sent a tow truck to take the car to a shop and such
And I of course I mean I worked eight hours a day and there is a moment when you've had enough I mean you've had enough that people call you with problems
and well, and, insulting you and telling you that that let's see if assistance arrives, that, and such, I mean treating you badly, when it is not your fault at all, because I was the last monkey
I was just another guy in the company and I didn't know anything, you know whether the company is good or bad, or what, they just paid me to, to
answer calls and give a service the best I knew then you know, that's why I feel a little bad for people who call you
Because this people that call you, have no intentions of,getting you mad  people that call have no intention of annoying you. the people that call you want to eat like you and me you know
And you want to have a job,then
yes
Don't know I feel a little bad,that is that that yes no that not because I feel bad I am going to buy a product that they sell, that that would be the height.
but you know, but at least treat them fine and tell then look I am not interested that is it, because the people like they say do not have attitude here in United States
yes
Is one is one of the things that I notice, I notice the cultural difference no and the what in Spain we call be be a "edge"
yes
yes that I do not know or I mean you know you need to be "edge" because people get on top of the chepa no,to the beard but
When there is no need to be "edge" then there is not,you know
you're right, not always is that way,but no I will not lie when say no, I'am always there, no and no and I do not want Ay.
Now
because is the same thing especially when they call my cell phone I say : ah
sure,sure
In the middle of the day or sometimes at work, I know what and I look like I have a lot of things to do.
yes, yes
Nobody has them but I have the balls.
Hey and count Odri That makes him a Peruvian with an Argentinian accent from New York.
Good, eh you know this is , is a halfway big count I'm good first, I'm good. Eh, I was born here with Peruvian but also my parents are gone.
aha
Good children of your country anyway.
aha
Neither of my parents have Peruvian decent, nor does my grandma have it and my grandfather also does have it.
mm
Eh, my grandfather lived in Argentina for a decade and
ah I understand
He was, eh he was forced to take all of the Argentinian culture
Ah that's what it is
And yes, but my mother has very little left
mhm
And it's good that I have it, I have it very strongly but it's because I worked to study in Argentina
ah, I understand
But anyway hit me if I'm wrong but I am not a legal professional
Hello?
Hello? Greetings.
Greetings. Ah, my name is Jenny and I'm calling from New York.
My name is Anni, and I'm calling from Miami.
Ah okay. Hello
Hello.
Um could you hold for a minute. The phone is ringing in the other line and I would be back immediately.
Okay.
Okay.
Hmm mm I'm, I'm coming out.
Hello?
Yes, no, It doesn't matter.
Excuse me, what was the subject of this call?
Music
Ah okay. Well, start. Yes, yes, you want to start.
Ah. Music, eh. We spent the whole day listening to music. I have a little girl of twenty-three months.
Oh okay.
And no, I don't let her watch TV, but I always have
Uh, Hmmm
music stood that was her throwing  a pi- a dish to the floor because we we trying to
Oh, ok.
Sorry
No, it's ok, don't worry
Uh, but, you know, we spend the whole day listening to music
Uh um.
Classical, or, you know, for, for playing or whatever. And we listen to it in English and spanish.
Oh, ok.
So when her/his father is at home, we speak only in English
Uh, um.
But when he goes to work, we only speak in spanish.
Oh, yeah, ok, i understand.
So, but, uh, ¿and you?
Oh, well, i, uh, normal, i, i, uh, i listen to every kind of music.
Right.
I don't, i don't have a favorite, i can listen to anything. Even music in another language.
Right.
Um, and yeah, i spend all day long, listening to different music because, like they says, music soothes
Uh um, um
Even the wildest animal, uh, uh, um, i think it's like that. So, at times, i work from, from home.
Uh um, um
And I also work in the court. So when I'm not in the court arguing something, I'm at the house. And, in those moments when you feel the most agitated,
Hm mm
Ah, it's the best moment to turn on the radio. And hear something to calm you and to put you back, in the
Yes.
In the mode of thinking of what should be. Uhm, not yet, I don't have kids but, uhm, I lasted several years working in a day care
Ahh.
And that was the best, when one wanted to
Hm mm
One class of, of eighteen kids of four years to calm down
yes.
put some, some music, classical
Hmm mmm, hmm mm, we
and it seems to change, the entire more of the room. Because, it affects the sound of, of the human animal, like they say
Well we had a
So hm mm.
not a bad time, but my daughter still-like two months ago that she started to sleep during the nights, entirely
Oh, okay
But when she was seven, eight years we would take her from our bed,
Hm mm.
to her crib. And I couldn't, you know, I had much difficulty in putting her to sleep, and finally I found out that yes I, eh, I would put music, with a sound machine,
Hm mm, hm mm.
you know, she sleeps well. And now, eh, we bought her an iPod
Okay
Because, eh, what i do, is that i have, you know, a month and like hundred or more CDs
Hmm
Then, i can select whatever i want her to listen. Normally when we send her to sleep
Hmm
we take you know, the, songs of cradle, i think they're called,
Ya
Them, eh, i put some music, turn on the machine of, the sound machine
Hmm
So, we read her some books. And so, when she hears that, you know, she goes to sleep by herself. She sleeps better. I then, eh, put her to sleep in the cradle, and in five minutes, it's done
Wow, so then she knows the routine
sleeping yes, and that, for that reason was that, we bought the, the iPod
Hmm
Because even when we are in our car, she wants her songs and to have all those, you know, more that five hundred ~CDs in the car,
Yeah right, is better bringing the iPod that
And them she is to like, someway, she isn't, sometimes, eh, she acts like a baby
Hmm
Then we bought the iPod with the money that she
Oh.
she, herself, you know
Right
That she worked in, uh, herself
So, it. it's, more or less, like her vagrancy, what you did
yes, yes
Oh, good, that's a good idea.
We did it, well part hers, and partly mine, because i have my music there too. So, you know.
Well, oh- sure. It's not going to be her music only.
Yes. So
Oh, oh, no, it'snot like that
Well, probably ninety five percent hers.
Oh, wow.
And, you know, because that's how we are in a place, whatever, because the, her little car too.
Uh um.
It has like, uh, an earphone
Yes
But with that, and, and when we bought it, i thought, ¿who's gonna put a, you know, a Walkman or something?, and that's what I'm doing now.
No, that's the best, it's the best because, I'm telling you the point of view of a person that was a teacher
Yes, me too.
The music that is- the, the kids that the parents, they, they let them the, they cultivate their love for music it's so much as um, teaching them to read.
Because it helps them with concentration, with, uh, the movements, if- if one observes kids sometimes it, when they listen to piano music,
with their little fingers as if they were playing piano. All of that helps,
Hm mm
for the, uh, development. I forgot, I forgot how to say development in Spanish
yes. yes, I understood, don't worry yes.
Well, for the development, that's it. The development of the child for e-, for yesterday, so you're working marvels. Because I always thought that. I say to my husband all the time. When we have kids,
there are certain things, that you may think are a bit crazy. Y was telling him, that I want
yes.
you know that I want to give birth in a bath with water, with music and he goes aha. You are half crazy
No, but look, we are going to have the, eh, our next baby,
Hm mm
God willing, in a week
Oh wow
And, you know, that's what we're doing. We're going to the, to a maternity center that we have here, and that's what we're going to do
Hm mm Yeah
Because you know, for me, the first one was a C-Section, and
Uuh
no, and it wasn't because I wanted to. It was supposedly for an emergency.
Oh, OK, oops, sorry, it's the dog. Sh, sh, quiet
But I think that. Okay
I'm sorry
That's okay. So,
Uh huh.
you know, a- so we're going to do that. And with here, she doesn't watch any TV.
That's best. Yea.
you know, uh. And oftentimes when we go to church, and they teach her you know with the little Elmo dolls
Hm mm
or whatever, she just looks at me like what's that. Yea people look at me like, how does she not know who Elmo is, and I say, well we don't watch TV.
No, that's, that's best, the best method to, to assure the, success of the child. To keep all that away from the. That's the problem with my husband.
Well I tell him, because his mom was a little strange because she taught him she let him to- he was always right in front of the TV.
Uh huh.
And I don't know if I even had a TV until I was thirteen years old. My mom and dad never bought a TV, we didn't have any of that. So he finds it strange
that I was always ahead in school. In the school system I was always ahead, uh, I finished college early, he was waiting on me. Everything I've done, I've done it quickly,
and easily, and he I don't know I always tell him it was because I didn't have all the d- distr- distractions. I didn't have a TV to take an hour or two
from my studies. You know it was always, it was focused, yea my mom and dad, we were poor, but yea, one of us wanted to play music and my mom and dad would do what they could to take us for music lessons.
You know, if we were interested in animals, we'd go to a museum
yea.
on the weekends, or, you know, there was always something educational. So you grow up little by little, I mean when you're, uh, a teenager,
you grow up, and, and you see the difference, and from your friendships you know about all that, that they know about that
yes.
and you feel weird, but then, when you become more, more mature, now, I look back and say, thank you! I always tell my mom and dad, than-, thank you so much. Because now I
I can buy all the things I want, if I want an iPod I buy one. I have one.
yes.
if I want, uh, a PlayStation, we have one here, but mostly it's just there picking up dust!
yes
because we never use it. I'm not interested and my husband says, if you are not sitting down to play with that thing, I won't play with it either.
yes.
So, it's just there. I also see the benefit of not wasting my youth away
Well, also, you know, I, since we are having a baby, I was thinking that we shouldn't let her
Hm mm
watch television, but, I was looking for an educational show that I could let her watch but
Well, there are many shows nowadays.
yes, but I, still I couldn't.
there are not that many, uh, channel 13 has some, around two, that are okay, two, that have the approval of the school system.
yes but,
in New York
the thing is, what happens is that I, I know that television, I won't have a problem eh, to get her interested in it.
Hm mm
And I rather,  yes I can try, to until she's around three or four years old,
Hm mm
that she continues with her love for books, and music, and all that, I much prefer, you know, that we continue with that. I don't know
No
if when the baby arrives, that, that I'll feel that for me to be able to put, to have a little bit of time, you know,
the most I'll do, if I do it, will be half and hour a day, and it's going to be a program that I know that
Hm mm Yea
you know, is educational.
Well, I, I trust, I don't know you, but I trust that you will do a wonderful job, because of the way I hear you talking
is everything that, in my mind, I saw and said, okay, this is what I want to do This is what I want to see and when I talk to my husband he, ah,
I don't know, I don't know But
But
but I know, I'm listening  and I realize that he is good, you know all you say is perfect. No, there's nothing
that I would do different, so to speak.
Well, the biggest problem we have is that we, we don't watch much TV
Hm mm
But, if you come inside our house, you think we watch a lot of tv, because our house, came with,
came with those, fifty-two inch televisions.
Oh my goodness, okay
So, also, last Christmas, we bought a TiVO.
Okay.
Then, we recorded the thing you already know, those old movies and or programs that we are interested but
Hm mm Hm mm
but it is nothing, we never see ABC, NBC or any of those.
Oh, yes, that's the best
It is always the Discovery Channel or what you already know, things like that, like the History Channel
Yes, mhum.
But because of that reason, because I don't want her to see telivision, my husband is watching least television.
Oh yes.
Because when he is in the house, she is awake, no, you know, we don't turn it on.
Oh okay, okay
Then, that was one of the difficulties we still have a bit, that he, he like, you know, he understands that I don't want that she watch television.
But he does not understand, that if he is watching television, she is watching
Is like, giving her permission
Mhum.
Yes. That is the problem I have with mine. I say, because also, I don;t watch television. I am always in the room.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, my name is Zula of Texas.
Ah, I'm Manuel, of Chicago.
Hello, Manuel.
How are you?
Good, and you?
Good, Good
You are a father again?
Excuse me?
You are a father again?
I am a father again.
Aha. There wasn't any problem.
No, everything was good.
Ah, how good, how good
Right it is, about five minutes ago I had my baby in hand
Aha
why did they take her to eat
Mhm. And it is in the house or is it still in the hospital?
si, in house. No, the next day we left the hospital, the next day after it was born.
Ah, how good.
everything was good and no we were only there, after he was born, after the bird, twenty four hours and that was all.
Mhm. Now, he awakes every two hours.
Yes.
Aha.
Every two hours we must feed him.
Mhm.
Well they are nursing him.
Mhm.
So you don't have to worry about giving him formula or anything.
Mhm. Well, it's not your turn to awake.
It's okay. No. That. Nothing, nothing one or two times he awakes but that is all only to be with them there
Mhm.
That's how it is
Speak with, am, Jenny.
yes.
And I also spoke with your brother. But, I forgot his name.
Ah, yes?
Because, he began to do it. To study as well. Because, ah, Jenny stopped participating.
How come you have told me nothing of it?
yes, the,I mean, that's what he told me when I spoke. Because, notice that I spoke two, two times, i need it to speak to a lady from New York.
Nothing above in spanish--??
And she spoke but, a little spanish,little, the spanish, spoke it very bad.
hurray.
Then, I send a e mail to the person of the studio, and I asked what will happened if I, hm will be my time to speak to someone that did not speak good spanish.
yeah.
And, he told me to hang up quick, it will end the call, because it will not charge that call.
okay.
Then, He sent an e mail to everybody in the world, saying that yes you speak with someone that don't speak good English and  the spanish.
uhm, do not talk to that person.
yes,I also receive one e mail from them.
yes
No words in Spanish here. lol ????
Then, it looks like, or your brother told me that Jenny read that message then decided not to participated anymore.
yes, yes it told me something about that, but uhm, I, I, I don't say that I was stopping of, of participating. just only told me that it was....
That it was thinking it was for her.
ah, aha.
ah.
no, no, I told to your brother, to tell that, I was who sent that e mail, and that, and that I cannot, I did not send it for her, it was spoken by that other lady that did not speak nothing of spanish, little words that knew to say in span-
uhm.
Ah.
Cause I think she speaks Spanish very well.
yes, she speaks well
mhm
It is  weird you get in the car with her, she drives a Van, a caravan
aha
ah, when I was in Nebraska with them I drove once and it was weird
mhm
I used it several days and took her cd case
mhm
I said, maybe she has music in Spanish
mhm
and you are not going to believe it, she had like 60 or 70 CDs
mhm
all of them in Spanish. and then  I asked her, Jenny why do you have music in spanish. I mean why don't you have music in english? and she said, no I like music in Spanish only I don't like music in english.
ah
Oh, I said, that's good.
mhm
yes, she knows everything, I don't know how long she has been practicing Spanish or speaking spanish. she speaks very well.
Eh. Ah How long has she been married to your brother? It sounds like your brothers children are grown up now.
Oh, the thing is, that she had her kid from before.
Oh, oh, she already had
But, they're like, I'm not sure, about four years old
Right
Three or four years
Yeah, uh, o
Yeah, and she had, she has children from her previous marriage
Yes
Oh, they have only one daughter
Um
From my brother's
Because, i don't remember what we had to talk about, but your brother was telling me that, um, no, i was asking him if, if he has had problems living there in Nebraska
since there aren't many hispanics, and he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there are no hispanics, he's the only Hispanic
Yeah
And, i told him that if he had problems with people looking down on him, or talking to him, and he told me he hasn't, that he has only had problems once with
With the father of another of the kids that were competing in wrestling with his, with his kids.
Oh, yes, one of them is a wrestler.
Om
But, you know, wherever you go you'll gonna find good and bad people.
Of course, yeah, it always happens.
yes.
But, oh well, he said no, he said he had many problems, in fact, he said he was getting many invitations to attend Christmas parties and all that
yes, I did notice that. They are so, I think that since this town doesn't have many Hispanics, in fact, there aren't any
Mhm.
you know, in places where there are many Hispanics, many, well they start to get along with the wrong people, bad people.
Sure, eh.
So, Americans start looking down at us, not anymore, to him.
Mhm.
I mean, a Hispanic. They think we are all the same, they think
Sure.
And since there are none here, they don't have
Prejudices against them, yes, mhm.
yes, they don't go like, this one is Mexican, he's not going to do that, he's going to do this.
Mhm, mhm.
No, I think that, they haven't, they  haven't met many Mexicans.
yes.
and because of that, they don't, since there are no Mexicans there, they don't have problems.
Mhm.
You know, when Mexicans have a party, they finish at one or two in the morning and they play the music at a very high volume, like that.
Mhm.
And, over there there isn't any of that.  Until just now.  Just now, in a bit more Hispanics will start arriving
yes, it's true.  It Happens
Yeah
And you, what music do you listen to?
Tejana.
Tejana, yes Hmjm
I like it very much, I lived much, oh, long time lived there in Texas  I like it a lot like the Tex-Mex one, as they call it.
Hmjm
All of that music
Hmm
And even though, here barely, sometimes, I can not find records of that, I search and, but, since it is barely heard here, it is not heard much,
Oh
so so.  Buy, yes, sometimes, when, my brothers come, or that I go over there, I bring music from there
And traditional music from Mexico, you don't like it?
I like the nortena, for the most part, the nortena

I am not one of those persons that constantly listen to music,I have friends that listen to music constantly.and now that people have those Mp3

Yes, there people that can't, are not able to sleep. Ah, my brother, that lives in Nebraska,
Aha
He, there was a time that he slept, and if there was no music he did not sleep.
Ah.
And I told him, turn off the radio already, you can't sleep without music, not without, without music, he does not sleep at ease. He said, awake, and awake happy, I sleep and I sleep happy.
Each one.
Yes, I like to wake with music. Thus, my alarm clock, also is, a music player. Then, when, it alarms in the morning, rather than the sound of those that
Kills your heart.
Yes.
Is, is the music that we have here inside the music player. Then, it is good because it wakes you little by little.
yes.
Aha
And, you're going, you go out there in, I don't know, dances or clubs? ¿In Texas?
When you arrive here in Houston, you will go out often to dance salsa.
Yes.
Yes, I encountered a group of people there where I go to school, that dance salsa and go out often. But, now no. Now I don't have time to go out anywhere.
Aha.
But, later, I did not, I, like when I became tired of going out because I had already gone to all those same places, and seen the same people, and
Always, the places were but too full of people. Then, I want to dance, and if I could not dance, and almost could not dance, and the people stepped on you or strike you when they are circling. Then,I had already tired of that.
Yes.
Besides that, you have to pay a lot to get into those places.
That's right.
It's like ten, fifteen dollars to get into those places. So, not anymore. I now go out but I rather go to a quiet place.
Ah.
yes, where you just sit and talk, and
We have a dance salon in here, Mexican groups come and play,
mhm.
Northern music, and stuff like that.
Aha.
You won't believe this, it costs around fifty dollars to get in.
Wow. But why, do they bring well-know groups or what? Aha.
Yeah, yes, yes, groups, yes. Still, some people are not lucky enough to get tickets, some don't get in.
Wow. But that's because you live in a very big city.
yes.
So,
I went once and I did like it, it's a nice place.
mhm
But you can't even walk in there!
yes and no. That's the problem, yes
Since the groups, they are good groups from Mexico, well everybody wants to go see them
Of course
The ball has a capacity of 4000 people, which are the ones who get in. I only went there once, and I really didn't like it
Yes
And well, i don't go out that much, too many problems, you go out and
Hello?
Oh think the call dropped
No, I'm here
Good Night!
Good Night!

It has started getting cold, but not as cold as Chicago
Oh yes, here in Chicago is very cold
That's right
Specially the snow
Oh, I heard that is terrible, terrible
Right
My brother in law lives in Chicago too.
Oh, yeah, ¿In which part?
Yeah, uh, i don't know, because i didn't, i didn't see where they lived, but he goes to the University of Chicago
Right, ha, ha
And i think they live nearby; i think over the University apartments, probably
Oh, ok, ok, ok.
So i don't know where
Look, you know the, today's subject, ¿right?
Yeah, the music.
Right, right.
And, ¿what music?, well, being from Puerto Rico, ¿What music do you like?
Well, i like very much Bachata music.
Bachata, ¿what's Bachata?
And, it's music, oh, no, no, soft.
Right.
That, when they sing that music it's, and Alejandra, Alex, well, i have always... i take, uh, CD's at the library
Oh, yeah
To listen to them. I also like Reggae, i don't know if you listen to Reggaeton, which is trending now.
Yeah, i have heard something, yes.
of "Daddy Yankee", "Don Omar", "Tego Calderón", "Ivy Queen"
and so, and so. So, living in Chicago, didn't you struggle to maintain, uh, the music you listened back at Puerto Rico, didn't you?
No, it's not the, almost
Because a lot
Almost the same
Because it isn't. There's a lot, there's a lot of var, i mean there's a lot of variety here in Chicago
aham, aham, aham
So you didn't miss that a lot, didn't you?
No no no because back then
Oh that's great!
back at Puerto Rico i listened to the Boleros, and Salsa but I don't really like Boleros nor Salsa because they aren't danceable.
I see.
They're more romantic.
I see.
But we use a lot the Merengue
Aham.
That like: Olga Tañon, Elvis Crespo
Oh, yes, yes, yes
Ah, here in, in Chicago they do a lot of... ah, Puerto Rican parade.
Oh, so great.
And they were invited they are invited.  This year came "Ivi Queen" which is the the the the Babe of Reggeaton.
in two thousand four Elvis came
Ah what
Crespo.
Ahm, really?
yes, then
yes, here in Idaho, nobody comes, then.
No.
No.
Here we also have a Boricua party, which is in September and Tego Calderon came ah they always make many concerts, in the parks, outdoors.
That is so awesome.
And they are free.  Many come, come ah, much much, ah they do something that says: "Long live Chicago"
Aha.
And they take lots of music from Colombia, from mexico, from all parts of Puerto, of, of the world.
Then you don't feel as far from from where you come from.  Eh?, yes
Aha, aha, aha
there is all that,
Aha
yes, here in Idaho no, there is nothing here.  Here the only music there is is music more, like Mexican, like
Aha.
I don't know what's it's called, but it's like "skippy", or i don't know how.
Right.
But it's music that i haven't heard over there in Chile either.
No
And of course, there in Chile you listen to music more like, i don't know, boleros too and
Right
stuff like that. But of course you miss it here, because you don't hear, you don't hear much of that. And no one comes here either. So you don't have
True
Right, right
concerts or any of that. And yea, i missed it so much that I'm now listening to satellite radio.
Right.
And that's how i could, i have been able to remember now many songs in spanish, because after like ten years, finally listening to songs that are playing now
that stuff like Reggaeton and all that
Right, right
I had no idea about that, because it's been like ten years since i listened to music in spanish.
Oh, because now here in Chicago we have a station that's, nine hundred three point one FM.
And it's music in spanish.
That plays reggaeton. All day long.
Oh, sweet
Right, so, specially when you're driving in your car
Aha
that you don't get bored put on the radio on high and the travels seem
Ofcourse.
quick, and you don't get bored, you don't fall asleep in the car or anything
Ofcourse.
Listening to music.
yes it's good having music in Spanish because
aha
because in English it's good but it's not the same
No, No
But it is not with what we've been raised or anything like that eh
aha, aha, aha
If now I'm happy with, wiith listening to music in Spanish once again, because really it makes a difference
Aha
In my mood and all of that
It's like that music I don't know if you're listening listened to the music that has when they are one waits for another person
I got the phone to speak that music I don't like because it's music like like classic and it's music when you go
For looking to see
when you go on an elevator
Of course
You have music, for me, for me
aha
it's not beautiful and they should change it.  Put on music, ah, Merengue or Bachata, or music
of course
ah, like, like Cumbias, Cumbias are beautiful
And more animated, right?
Aha, aha, aha
Instead of annoying you, if you're waiting so long, at least you can dance, right?
Aha, aha, aha No, it's that, ah, you go to sleep waiting.
yes
Look this very minute I was waiting, ah, fifteen minutes.  To, ah, to be able to communicate.
Seriously
Aha, the other time I was waiting half an hour and when I went, to, to communicate with someone they hung up because supposedly it was eleven at night
They already hung up on calls
Seriously?
Aha, aha, aha
My
How many times have you talked?
Twice with this one.
Oh, yeah!  I've already been with this
Yes
is thirteen.
¡ woow !, then call you, because I was specting than calling me,
Ajá.
but then you can call and wait.
no, no, they call you, you can call and after five of the afternoon, you can call to anyone, after five.
To anyone you like.
Ah, ¿And you can talk more of once a day?
No, no, just once.
Once a day.
Yes.
Yes, the other time that I talk, I speak with my sister, because we call at the same time.
Ajá
And my sister lives in Atlanta, en Giorgia
ohh
And I speak with her. She is who in the recording for this show when you hear to the child saying what to do and all that stuf,
ajá. ajá
She is my sister
Ohh
Then when she did the recording she say to me that calling for we could hear her and speak with her, Thah was the only time that I speak, because from there I don't speak more
Ohh
So, this is mi first time talking with someone else.
! Good Lord! You are missing a lot, you are missing twenty tree.
Yes, I got my act together and that is why I called, because I was waiting for someone to call me. But nothing happened.
Because the last time they put it for politics.
Yes
I called and no one picked up the phone. No one did it.
It scares. Is it not?
But, you know, I receive calls each afternoon at 5 pm.
Oh, OK
That if I want to pick up the phone to talk, but I do not pick up the phone because I do not know what they are talking about.
Ohh
How is the music? This is the second time that I talk.
Sure
I have talked with many people from Nebrasca, Philadelphia, Miami.
Ah, I see
Yes
No, I like the music topic, easier. The other time it was about immigration. That is what I think.
Oh, yes, I spoke too.
I do not like to talk about politics and migrations because
ha
What happened, it doesn't say, i don't know.
from, the politics, i don't like politics, but i talked about immigration, i talked about marriage music.
ha yes
about cell phones, well a lot, i only have nine left to go thanks god.
and after twenty something calls, you don't have to call anymore right?
after twenty five calls, you wait two or three months, they then send you a cheque home.
oh, that's good.
yes
okay, then I'm going to start working, im going to start calling.
yes, after five o'clock you can call anyone that appears on it, you dial the phone number that appears
of course.
you have to call, then you communicate, but it has to be after five in the evening, that's the time they change the,
title of what they're talking about, the theme,
oh ok, and is everyday different?
well, last time, i talked about five times referencing marketing, i talked five times.
Oh, five consecutive days.
i talked for about an hour with two music, three with marriage, once with cellphones, there's lots of themes.
oh
but,but they didn't change, but now that they've put a new lady  to talk, the themes have changed.
Sure
But first you have, you had to talk, well, a lot, of a lot, the topics. Ah almost always they were the same topics, so people can talk
Sure
Look then, ah
Ah
You, ah. When you are driving, do you listen music or not?
I do, I listened music too but, um I also listen, but a lot, there was a lot of time that I stopped listening music and I started listening
problems, conversation programs
aha
about Politics
aha
But it's like, after a long time I get use to it and I forget to listen music and the days pass by without listening to music
aha, aha
And the I realize that your music. I mean the music really changes your mood.
aha,
Form for the rest of the day. No?
aha
So now, I started listening music to have better mood
aha
Because I don't know, it would be because of our Latin blood, I guess
yeah, yeah,
But, one needs
yes, yes, yes,
Need that. You know, that, that, the dancing music, that music
yeah
yes, because here I do not listen to much music like that of that style
yeah
right?
No, not merengue, or salsa, not, not, not, regueton, nothing? It's just regueton?
No, I like everything now.
yeah,
Before, when I was in Chile, I did not like salsa, or Merengue, nothing like that. Now, that I am here, I love it
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Now, the only thing I need to do is to learn it, that's all. But, I love it
No, but no, don't you watch it on television when they are dacing?
No, they do not have it here, nothing Latino, no merengue, nothing of nothing here.
Oh, no
No, because there are very few Latinos here.
yeah, yeah,
Most ones here are like unique, they are Mexicans
aha
but on TV, on the radio, there is nothing nothing Spanish, nothing Latino.
No movies either?
On TV no, none.
No?
No, nothing.
Uh, ahm
So that, we are in the middle of nowhere.
Ah, bless you! Imagine that.
Yes, it's boring.
Uhh
Boring; when I went to California to visit I was to-
Betsy, hello, how are you?
one time yes I am Tammy again, well and you, Oh my Goad
here sitting, seeing what you can tell me about social assistance or whatever because I have no idea
no yes here well I think that some things are good but others are not
aha, aha
especially the one for older people they they don't give them enough money or or it is not because of the money but that they need medical help the pills are not completely covered
oh
then it is more difficult for them you know to take their pills because they have to think about that I have to pay for the pills or do I have to eat
aha, oh
because they have to pay more and also sometimes also there are people who abuse I know people who well they are not my friends but I know that they have they are abusing
mja
of those uses that real people, that other people really need
mja
OK but it is difficult I have my wedge, my mother of my husband
mha, aha
and she is partially on assistance but no, they don't help her much and there are, she has to search for coupons and things like that to see if she can buy medicine in another place that is cheaper or
to buy a medication this month or to buy another medication the next month.
oh that's ugly, aha
Because he cannot have all of them and that is bad because if you don't take things as you are supposed to take them
aha, no
They will not help you, so that makes you scared.
And, and this is the welfare or pension or
That is it, mja or from welfare
that is it, yes, I can imagine
Assistance that is given to them here isn't much, and it is hard to get, and you have to show, ehh, to show that your need is real.
you have this, but, no matter what, and if you do what it takes to get it you have to be working
mja
And, and if you do not know they do not pay you well, but they pay you twenty dollars or a little more than twenty dollars from the
mja
or, I think it is less than twenty dollars from what the, the limit that they will give you does not help
yeah
I say this because it is twenty dollars over the limit that they have but really that is not a lot
yeah
and they do not want to, so they prefer that you do not work
I see
So that they are able to help you, but the help that they give you is not enough for you to be able to survive.
But, yeah, but they don't pay you, let's say, for all the medicine you need?
No, so they are giving you something, but they can't, they do not help you.
Aha.
They don't want to help you because you do a lot, supposedly, and a lot isn't enough.  You can't survive on this, and you have to work so that you can make enough for them to help you.
and what they help you with is not enough there is many ways anyway
not that much, it is hard mija, is very hard for persons to try and do that, I believe that I imagine that is why some people work under the table
yeah,yeah
Because they can not say that they are working because then they will not help them and they have children, well that is another thing
yeah but but after the eighteen years they no longer help. when your children have there eighteen years they will no longer help
no,no that is why I was seeing my son my child that crazy comes to my home and tells me, Hey mom so why do you not want apply to the government for them to give me lunches
mja
I say hey we make too much for them to give us lunches, I thing I give you to but lunches and I give you the paper
aja
four childern, wait four persons in the home they want you to make about Twenty four thousand dollars
aja
that is not enough, in a year that is not enough
twenty four thousand dollars a year. oh my goodness for four persons no,
four persons not especially if I take those persons with a baby
aja
because I say that, I say it is a le, I was showing my husband and I tell him them people are crazy,  who is doing I say where you work and where you live because here where I live
mja
well that miracle that when my son moved he found an apartment eh close to us and it was seven hundred twenty five a month and that is cheap
mja but does not include utilities
mja,no that do not include nothing them you can imagine with two
aha, oh okay mha more expensive
so I say that if a person has four people in the house and it has been twenty and four thousand that he can not, he can not
mha, it is not enough
so that for me because of that that I always that talk with my children, be careful, work take care of your your credit and save your money
mha, that is, that they don't spend it on things that they don't need
because what is, mha do you recall now that I spoke with you yesterday
yes, aha, you already moved back
my son is back, the oldest one that had moved this one in my house again he already fought with his girlfriend and the girl did something bad to him and that man my son when you do something bad to him he says good bye and like that never will see you again
boy
so he got all of his things, my husband went over there and took all of his things and there isn't anything else of his in that apartment anymore
wow
now it really happened
that girl must have done something very bad mm
aha, the very bad that this man got like that when he called me mom so and I tell him I support you so come over here here I I will convince him so he can go to the to school because
well yes already and when he moved with the girlfriend he was not working, oh, aha
yes he was but now he is I want well he can go ehm ehm the people from work said that he can go to the school in the morning
mha
and to work after that so they will help him so I tell him well I tell him if you move here, if you go to school I will not charge you for rent
like that it is good aha
but if you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because I want him to finish school
Of course, mja
because is going, I say too many things especially with him yes he does not want to finsih school it will be difficult to get things so I want
mja or have a good career also I will not send him to work at McDonald's forever
mja, so that, right yes, if because that's what I say then something happens to him and you don't do  he feels you'll end up asking for help, you are a man and I say no
mja
there is no need as young as he is to not finish his things having us here when we can help him and he does not accept it
mja
I always give him the example of the people we know, look you don't wna to end up there, work hard
no, not because he does not want to have, that the government nor, neither will help him
um, yes and like it's there in Canada with him, with this, the insurance
well they make you work here when we got here ah just got here from El Salvador fifteen years ago and they gave us an apartment to rent and gave us
mja
bed and furniture and but we had welfare
aha, mja, aha
during a few months from there, because we went to the school and from there my parents got a job and my brother and I were in high school
from there because my paretns were working they helped us because my brother was fifteen
aha
and I already, I already had eighteen they did not help us for. for me, just for my brother but I got into high school and did not work until, until when
yes but the put in me in the, in the welfaresometimes before but I though that here they would help you a little because they give you a card for medicine
aha
Mja, and he and he has to present it at the store where he will buy the medicine and and they will pay well that was the last time that I asked for assistance
but now ah now I do not know how it will be, it should be more difficult
no, yeah, I do not know. We, when my husband came from, he was in the air force.
Aha, mja
then we arrived here and he also does not pay that much that was in like 92
aha
and then when we arrived here it was insufficient to be able to pay the rent and like that we came into the program for a month
aha
sufficiently to be helped and for the time it took for him to find work so he took a month
how great
well he found a job within a month but you know that the next paycheck then it took us a month and we came out one time from there but when one goes to the store with those they, one of them that they give you are like fake papers
for real?
the people they, if when you go out shopping and that was years ago so today I believe they give you a card
oh aha
but the people give you mean looks
they look at you as if you were from another planet
aha yes because no because no because they are giving you help and you see that you can work, we can work but they did not have any with my two children I told myself that I could not work because where would I leave the little ones that I have I could have paid someone and I did not have anything to pay them with
mja aha that is true
and then I told my husband never again, never
no
I say that I work whenever before I would get into that and the always has told me that under I do not put my family like that
no
so that because it is how they look at you bad I say no man because you are asking for a little help
like, mha.
because it cou- things didn't turn out well or but is is very difficult
already they for sure, they the same thing happened to them and they give you a dirty look it is like that
aha, they don't recall, people that don't recall about that
mh
but I not I am not like that when I see people that have in the need I say it can happen to anybody from one day to the next it happened to me
oh yeah of course
so that and well ahm I say
why look bad at people who get govermental help, it helps really, it's not a big thing
mja, what I say, they are not stealing they didn't go crazy and start stealing they are
aja yes
they went because they had to go and ask for help and maybe they didn't want to do that but they had to
mja mja and what what it was like a little paper that said that the government would help and the people knew
mja
it's not money and they don't send you a check for your house or into your account
no no, ah, eh what, what well they send you a check
mja
well that was in ninety two is what I remember. They send you a check and then they send you a little book.
Aja
little like the monopoly money
oh oh
and it was like five dollars, twenty dollars and you had to take it out of there and give it to the person and they didn't give you change
oh no
it's like you had to try to have the adequate because, I say, no, say it's that
and the government would do it to make you ashamed
mja and so had to they had to be sure that you didn't use it for alcohol such that looks bad and so I think now with the card it is better
ah, mm, yes
Hello?
Hello?
How are you?
Well.  And you?
Good, thanks, and my name is Ernestina, and you?

A girl?
She's two as well, right?
She'll be two on November the 18th
Oh, how nice, no, 18, oh, boy
Hmm
So you know, hmm, she's, uh, she gives a lot of work?
Ah, no, she, she's very good. She has her moments when, you know, she she doesn't listen to what I tell her
But
yeah
when I talk to her and I ask her to do something, she does it. Because, if not, then, you know, I make sure, that she does it
yeah
because I want for her, you know, for her to behave good.
Yeah, Ah, that's good.
Therefore,
Ah,
she doesn't have the opportunity to be bad, let's say.
Oh, boy. And you live with, ah, another person
Yes, with my husband.
Another. Your, your husband, is that it?
Ah?
That's it? Your husband and a girl. right?
Yes
Oh, The other one, that's coming?
No
Another girl, a girl coming, or boy coming?
I don't know.
Oh you don't know. Oh
So you know, the only thing we want, is for it to be healthy.
That's good, Ay, and it's hot in Miami today. right?
oh, no. Today, uh, it was not too hot, today was really nice, it was hot but it was cloudy. So then, it was very breezy. But probably, the temperature was still around eighty, eighty-five, eighty-six around there
oh, oh, boy
but the humidity was not too high. So then, it was a very, very hot day.
Oh,
because, what does not, not affect much here is only the temperature
yeah
but the humidity. So then, we have, normally, I think is about seventy, eighty, eighty percent, of, of, of humidity.
mhm
and we you leave the house,
yeah
you know, just as you get out, you start to sweat. Because, is as if someone is hitting you with a wet blanket.
ah,
is very, you know, is very sticky and,
yes,
but, now, we are getting into the time of year, that is not, not so bad, we feel hot, but the humidity goes down.
oh,
but, you know, like, for example, I can wash my hair,
yeah,
oh, and I can be the whole night with my hair wet
oh
because I'm not parched because there's a lot of humidity.
Oh, boy.
And, especially if I wash it in the morning and leave it in a, in a little bun, a bun,
Aha. Ah.
The hair I've left wet the whole day.
Oh, wow.
So, you know, always it's n- not the heat as much as the humidity, I believe.
Yes.
So, and, over there it's cold, or still is, no?
Ah, n- it's cold, it's maybe, sixty.
Wow.
yeah it's cold today. But, you know, um, um, um. But it's very c- yeah, no, it's cold. Yes.
And when you, eh, normally have snow
What?
When you, normally, it begins to snow, the time it snows, and all that?
Ay, maybe ah, the other day. It was se- se- eight- no, seventy. The other day was seventy, and, but today, it's very cold. And, every day is
The change, i- is, it changed a lot. Maybe today is si- sixty, tomorrow fifty, you know, so.
Then, eh, But, when does it begin to snow?
I don't know. I don't know.
Because, I thought that, that it snowed in New York.
Oh, in, in New York, ¿who?
¿Didn't you tell me you were in, uh, you live in New York?
Yes
OK
Yes, i live in New York.
I think, ok.
Um
Ok, no, i thought that it snowed in New York, that's why i was asking you.
You talk too fast.
Oh, I'm sorry.
¿Where, uh, where, um, you are, what, from Honduras?
No, no, uh, my parents are from, um, Dominican Republic.
Oh
But i was born in Puerto Rico.
Oh, ¿is your mother dominican?
And my father too.
Oh, ¿why's that?, here in New York, there are a lot of dominicans.
And Puerto Ricans too.
In, in, yes. A lot of Puerto Ricans, and a lot of Dominicans. I live in the Bronx
Um
And it has, there are very poor people in the Bronx, you know. But, everything, everything, you know, eh, what's that, what's that?
Everything for the dom-, and, and dark skinned people too. So, It has dark skinned people, dominicans, oh, Mexicans
Hmm
in the Bronx, and puertoricans, and Haiti, Haitians
Yeah, from Haiti
you know?
Yes, from Haiti
Me?
from Haiti
yes, Haiti, yes. What else? Ah, Jamaica, Jamaicans
from Jamaica
Yeah. So I, people are very poor. They don't have a lot of money, here in the Bronx. You know? Do you have a lot of money? do you have a lot of pesos?
I don't think so. I mean, we have a house, but my husband is the only one who works. And we have to, you know
Yes
no, we don't have a luxurious life
yeah
We, we have enough money to buy what we need, food, pampers
yeah
you know, pay the, the electric bill, whatever. But we, we don't have anything to go on vacation, you know, nothing at all
yes
We have what we need. But,
Oh.
you know, we only own one car, we don't have two cars. And, here, usually, people have
Aha.
two cars.
Oh. You don't have two cars?
No. No, we have one car.
Oh, do you live in small or big house, or where
No, we own a house, it's a pretty small house
Oh.
Eh, we have three bedrooms.
Oh.
and two bathrooms. It's not big. And around here, some of the houses are, very, very, very expensive.
Oh, yeah, yes.
So, you know, I'm telling you, we have what we need.
Yeah
But, it's not a life of luxury.
Wow. And what ?
And we don't have, you know, we are not starving, and no, we don't need more clothes,
Yes.
but as i am not working, i stay with my, my daughter
Yes
it makes us difficult
And about the, about the clothing it's quite expensive also, the clothing?
Am, i think that yes, Look we, i, almost a year has passed from when i bought clothing. I buy my girl's clothes in a, in a consignment shop
Yes
And, you know, we save a lot of money that was. But, i don't go shopping, i don't do lot of, you know, i don't
Yes
do shopping either because the, clothing is to expensive.
Yes
So then, we normally buy clothes, we go, eh, from shops like Costcos
Oh,
o, or Sams, something like that,
Yes
and if we something that suits us, and is good, we buy it there.
Oh
But, me, go shopping, no. I don't do that. What
Oh, my goo- (?)
you know, that thing doesn't matter to me, you know, yes, yes, i have lot of clothes, and i don't care if it's branded or what,
whatever
Yes
That is not dirty, and that is no

plus, several states, i have other in wisconsin too, i´m going there many times
mmm
that it stays me near
mmm
so, What will you tell? for travel when you have time i like do it in the car driving here
ahhh
because you go to stop and rest when you like it
sure
that's with the family, you have to stop to rest
mmm
if you go in a bus you are going to stop only once and its very uncomfortable
mmm
and nothing else
but when you had been to Arizona, you had been visited some turistic places only
ahh, Grand Cannon
you went to the gand Cannon
yeah
ahh, Do you liked?
ohh, Its Beautiful
yes, yes
It's very nice, although it's very, very much like a dsertic zone
of course, yes
but there are many beautiful things
mhm. And you have only been to Mexico to visit your family, or have you visited other places as well?
Well, I have family in twos states, in Durango and Monterrey
aha
ah, in Monterrey there are many, it's like, how can I say it? They have many kind of touristic places, where you can walk, eh, know
mhm
it's an industrial city, ther are many, how can I say it? many things to do, there aren't this kind of things but it's very nice
mhm
There are two, I don't know exactly what they are, like rivers one is called horse tail
mhm
they are like very big waterfalls, very tall
mhm
many people visit them, from different parts as well
mm
it's very nice
and would you like to go to any other country in the world?
oh, yes, I would like to visit Alaska
Alaska?
Yes
Mhm
Go to meet what it is
there is very cold
eh, exactly what it is really cold
Mhm
i would like to be there
Yes, the boss I had before went to the antartica, or south pole
Yes
Yes, to see the penguins, because the penguins are just at the south pole
Yes
and ah!, she loved it, there are cruises you can take to go to alaska, you take it from California, and then take you to Alaska
Yes, i had known before
and then you get to see all glaciers and all the mmm
Yes yes, I like enough to go to meet there
Mhm
but sometimes there is no time
Ah, yes, No
and when?
It costs time and money
when you sometimes have the time you don't have money
Yes. Yes, is difficult, no, is that i like
What happens is
Aha
how ? Yes, tell me
No, no, you tell
Oh, what happens is that, i tell you, like when you you have holidays, you, what is, that good, at least i, ah, i try to
go out to see my family, go visit them sometimes ah
Right, mhm
though, two or three years without seeing them
Mhm.
you have and opportunity of course but i prefer to, see my family, taking walks too i don't know
Mhm
Eh, we are like, very united, we visit each other allot
Yes
and that's good, you have times that is better to go out and see the family
Right. Yes, is difficult to go see your family and go on holidays and and more when you marry because you have to se your family and
your wife's or husband's family
Oh, talking about, that is another issue.
then there time is up and the and vacation and the money and all, goes there
Yes, well actually time because the, ah, I'll tell you that money I don't spend much, when you go see family I don't spend much like when you go to
Yes, yes
I don't know, that you go on a trip, to see different ah, cities or countries
Mmh.
there you spend more because you have to spend on hotels, food
Mmm.  Yes, of course.
and, of coures, you go to see, wherever you go you are going to spend money
Mmh.
to go out with the, to visit family you do spend, I don't tell you you don't, but
Mmh
you don't spend as much
Of course, yes
it is very different.
Yes. Yes, I love traveling, I hope now that I start working as a nurse and I start to to have money, to be able to travel
That's great
to the, wherever I want to go, but yes, I, eh, I have been to Europe and I have been in Costa Rica and Guatemala I have been in Mexico but only in Mexico City
in Puerto Vallarta and Chiapas.
Oh, yes?
Ah, I was in eh in San Cristobal and ah, where else was I in Chiapas? In eh I don't remember.  But Ah, and I was in ah in Taxco also, when I was
Oh, Taxco
yes, when I was in Mexico.
on vacation?
Ah, Yes, yes I have a friend that loves to travel she loves to travel but to stay long in other countries she just got back from being abroad two years in
in Taiwan and when I ran into her in Mexico, she had been six months in Mexico and so she was touring the whole country
and I rant into her when I was in Chiapas so ah, that's how we went to San Cristobal and to Guajaca and then we went to Taxco and we returned, oh
I returned, she stayed.
Yes, I with the vacations.
Ah, from Mexico City. Ah, well she was studying
Oh,
she was studying, so eh, what she did was she took the classes as independent studies so while she was studying and taking classes, she was traveling in Mexico.
Mm, how nice.
Yes, yes, then ah, when I did ten trips with her, I didn't spend hardly anything because we stayed at hostels, I don't know how I don't remember what you call them
but I mean, you can stay there, you stay there and you have to sleep in a room with a lot of people no? but we didn't pay anything, we paid like
two dollars, or three dollar a night
Mm
but almost everyone is a student, and you have to share a room with people that you don't know but
But like that, at least you know you are in, with people, there's no, you're not in danger, rather, over there
no, yes, they are people that
these are, are
who is doing the same as
oh, excatly, people who are in the same
they come to travel like so, and they want to spend little money so they stay like so and then that was good but I also went to Europe and I stayed a month also in
traveling to Europe but that ended up being expensive but my parents helped me because it was my present for graduating from the university so yes but after I was in Houston
I have only gone to Aruba which is in the north coast of Venezuela.
Okay.
Yes. and that is an island like Puerto Rico but I didn't like it, it is a a famous tourist site in the Carribean but I didn't like it.
because Puerto Rico is also an island and Puerto Rico is a lot greener and this island Aruba is deserted, there is nothing.
absolutely nothing the only thing is that the beaches are beautiful but aside from the beaches there is nothing to see
It's deserted there?
In Aruba, yes
Yes
Yes, it is very dry there is nothing, absolutely nothing it's very flat and the only thing that there is is rocks, everything is very rocky and the
beaches are also rocky
Yes
Yes, the sand is white and the water is very clear and you can see you can see beyond the water, it is very clear blue
Notice.
but but no, there is nothing else to see absolutely nothing else
Mm.
like that so I didn't like it but that but yes I am lucky that all my family is in Puerto Rico and and except a sister that I have who lives in Florida.
the, all the rest are in Puerto Rico but still, now, for example, I went to visit my sister in Florida and then in August
and then I traveled to Puerto Rico to visit my family and in December I'm going to Canada to visit my boyfriend's family
so, I don't have any time or money left to go anywhere else
That's right.
because I'd have made three trips, three flights, I mean, I have no money  left to go anywhere else, so I think that when I finish school, I'm going to take some
time off on holidays before I start again, I'm going to work to
To rest.
Yes, or to go some place where I want to go, a different place, no, not just to visit family
Well, that's fine too, because once you start working, you will be starting and you don't know how your life is going to turn out, since your whole life is going to change, right?
Mhm. Yes. Yes, and usually when you start working, they don't let you take time off
Mhm.
I've heard of companies that tell you that you can't take time off during the first three months, you can't go on vacations, and some other companies say it's six months.
You see.
so, yes. How's your baby doing?
Oh, very well, thank you.
Yes, yes. Getting bigger.
Yes, he's fine, he's getting bigger, he was born on a Wednesday and we took her to the pediatrician on Saturday.
Aha. Aha. Aha.
and she had gained about a pound.
Aha.
Uh, the doctor was telling us, ¿right?, i was there, uh, well, we were talking to him for a while, he told us that it's very good that she gained weight because many children
when they're born, they usually tend to get a little thin, lose weight
Uh um.
And, and this girl didn't lose, on the contrary, she gained weight.
Right
She's doing fine
Right.
Uh, um, well, i hope she keeps like that, without having problems.
Yes. Yeah, yeah, right, at first they grow so fast
Yes
So fast, yeah, until they're like two, after that they start to, i mean, they still, they're still growing
Betsy, yeah, oh hi Alex
ah Betsy, yes you're talking to Alex again, how are you ?
fine thanks, and you ?
fine, then the subject of the trips
something interesting
yes something interesting
better that poli-, than the politics o r whatever
yes i had a lot of different opinions
yeah
right, you want to start this time
sure, okay ah right if you had money, lots of them and all the time i would like to go to Hawaii for at least two months
i say
and, what for ?
because i never got there and the gran-, the grandmother of my husband says that it's beautiful because she goes every now and then and I would like to go on a cruise
you husband is Canadian ?
yes, he is
yes a cruise would be fantastic
yeah because i never got to go on a cruise before, never did, and you ?
right i traveled one time to Spain
aha
and to Jibrartal and I liked it very much but the southern part of Spain where the beaches are
ah yeah
eh they were very pretty landscapes
mhm
but I didn't have the money to stay very long
mhm
and that always me it frustrated me and then if I would win a prize and I had the money
mhm, yes
and also the time and of course when one has money one must have time
yeah
and then me I would love to travel to Spain and visit the
ay yeah
there are many castles and interesting things there
uh huh
ah many things of the of the of the old world, many Roman things ah it's interesting, it's it's to know history
mhm
and but one needs money, it's an expensive country especially for traveling
uh huh
yes and no it's not very dangerous where I am Columbia is very dangerous
uh huh
There one does not have fun even though it is a beautiful country
mhm
One is always afraid of the security of the country
Yeah
No, Spain is better
Yes, if there weren't so many wars, I would like to go to Israel
Dangerous
Yes, but no, if there was no war
Yes
I would like to go there
Also Colombia is a fantastic country, if there weren't what
ya
you have great scenery and some tremendous mountains
yes, I imagine so, yes
Yes and we have coast there as well but the problem is the war and the
mhm
the drug trafficking, that has damaged the country totally and the image that they have of me is horrible
Yeah
Yes what more, between the US is where you'd like to travel or between Canada?
en Canada, I would like to go to Montreal
yes, they have told me that it's nice but cold
now here where we live now this winter it's just rain, nothing more
yes
where we used to live before winter was a lot of snow and it was super cold
where do you live?
in the, near Vacouver
there is no snow?
no
impossible
no, because we're near the, we're near the sea
you're very far North, is there never snow?
well sometimes there is but the next day it's gone
yes
and it doesn't freeze, no no eh
because here in Los Angeles there's never snow, maybe just in the mountains
aha, yes, here too, here it falls
yes
mm I wouldn't know, maybe once every three months or something like that, maybe yeah, it falls
but if it falls if must fall because you're very far North Betsy
yes
yes, you're near Alaska
yea but it's, it's not too far because well, it's there next to the Pacific Ocean
yea near Seattle, Washington
yea, ah yea
have you been to Seattle, Washington?
yea ahh no not really, no
I'd like to go there
yea
yes and also Washington, DC once I went to the capital
mhm, mhm
there are some nice things there, museums, I really like history so everything that has to do with history and, like on classic city is Montreal, Canada
mhm, yea two years ago
they say that Canada's really pretty
ah yea if you like the winter, I mean the snow
and no, there's not really as much insecurity like there is here in the United States
no, at least I haven't seen anything too bad
here in the United States it's bad
yea, just think
it's almost, almost like Latin America now
mhm
yes, that is why they criticize immigration here a lot because it is a lot of immigration here and it is a bad immigration
I see
and it has spoiled the country very much
hmjm
through through through out the years I have seen that this country has really declined and now in the United States there is a big difference between the rich and the poor
hmjm
that did not happen before, I think in Canada there is more of a balance
Ehm
there is, there is not that much difference between a rich and a poor person in Canada like there is here in the United States
there is a lot of poor people here
but there are more social prog-programs over there
well yes, yes that is true
and there isn't that much people there, the problem here is that there is a lot of people
uhm, um, I see
yes, the country has gone down unfortunately yes, a lot ehm
we went to Florida, Florida two years ago already
yes and it is dangerous
yes
they can rob you, they can do something to you there is a lot of poverty as almost like a Latin country already I don't don't see much of a difference now
uhm
yes and you know the Latin countries are known for the difference between the rich and the poor
I see it is true I see
and that is becoming, the United States in becoming like that
hmm
yes, but there are there are there are interesting things and one time I went to Texas and I liked the views, me
aha
I have always liked the Colombian plains
super hot
super hot but very pretty
I see
and the plains of Texas are similar, a little more developed and oh the broiled meat I like it
there is I see
and a lot of broiled meat was bought in those places ehm
I see
it is interesting I would like to know Texas more
aha
through its views, through the plains above all, I love the plains the flats the kowboys I like them
the horses
and the barbecues
I see, hmm
I love barbeques how they say in Colombia the barbeques.
yes
and you find that a lot in Texas
ah that's great, mm
yes, yes, I think is one of the most interesting parts of the United States and I would like to visit Seattle because of its cafes, they say they have good coffee there
really? that, that I didn't know, mm
yes, yes
well my parents are going to El Salvador in November for two months.
there are volcanoes over there, yes
oh, yes yes
yes I remember and the scenery must be beautiful over there
yes yes there is but then again there's poor people and
there's security
there's hardly any jobs, yes
yes that's the problem with all the Latin countries that have never been able to get ahead
yes is true, mm
yes, I hope one day they can do it
yes someday
yes yes but I've heard that the scenery there is very pretty because there's a lot of volcanoes.
and yes there are, mm yes there are
and mountains, and you know salvardor beaches? how are they?
Yes ah, they are pretty good, there is one that is called libertad, and there is another that there is a lot of swimming pools and sea waves are very big
big waves?
hi there, hi wave
because there is pacific and also the Atlantic, if
I thought it was just in the Pacific
how many seas have? only pacific
like here
yes
because Florida is the Atlantic
yes
Mhnb
because colombia has the Atlantic and also the pacific, Colombia has two seas
oh
so it is a very nice country, I tell you of Colombia because beauty trumps many countries
Mhm, i can imagine
tbe country is the worst but in beauty has much
OK
just as it has many queen models
ay ay ay the queen models, and coke, eh no
but there are many bad things
yeah, yeah, it's true
yes, there are many things, I do not denied it, you cannot deny the truth
yeah
of that situation, there are bad things
I can imagine
and not only that, there is insecurities and uh,
mhm
and when you do tourism, you do not want to go to place where something bad could happen
mhm, yes is true, yeah
right? you want to travel to a place, where, where, where there is not much insecurities.
mhm
even though I tell you, one thing that will scare you
what is that?
I was never mugged in Colombia
realky?
and I told you in Spain, I was once robbed in Spain
really?
yes madam ,must be
how weird
I got robbed to, at at a subway train
Aha
And they took my wallet
Oh no
And they stole like I don't know a hundred dollars
And that was in Spain
Yes or maybe more, what?, In Spain
In Spain, not Colombia
And in Colombia where, where, it's so famous for those things of
aha, I see
nothing was stolen to me because that was one of the reasons that I always too good precautions
aha
and in Spain when you are taking precautions
I see, mhm, that's true, I see, mhm
yes, yes, and you know something, there was a terrorist attack in there too
in Spain?
yes, some trains were blown-up, they set up bombs people, it was due to Arab terrorism
aha, oh, in Spain, really?
and lots of people died in Spain, this happened in the train stations that I used
oh, aha, I see
to take a few years ago, I used to be on those places where the attacks took place
and that happened recently?
about a year ago
oh
yes, so, you know, if something bad is going to happen to you
mhm
it will happen no matter where you are
that's true, I see, mhm
Good night I am Joe
Hi, Hello, Good evening, where are you from?
I am from Colorado
From Colorado, and originally?
From Puerto Rico.
Ah, I am, I am in Idaho and am from Chile
From Chile, how great, how long have you been there?
am, in the United States ten years, in Idaho three.
Ten years, oh.  And how do you like it?  Do you miss your homeland a lot?
yes a lot, well it is like Colorado no, Colorado has a lot snow.
And does it change often? this season changes of
Of course
from cold to hot or from hot to cold?
Of course, and Puerto Rico is not like that, right.
today Puerto Rico is so so, the same weather every year, but there your, to, to, rainy moment and its very sunny moments throughout the year like,
July can be very sunny and, May well very rainy.
o, but no snow, like
Oh, no never, no
And how long have you been there?
Oh, I have many years here, more than twenty years.
Oh, a lot.  And to for, a, since we talk about travelling, have you travelled to Puerto Rico?
Well look that, since, a, in ninety-three since my parents died was the last time that I traveled to Puerto Rico.  But I have traveled to other places, I have gone to Mexico.
And I have gone, to other places, and parts of the United States also including Florida which is a
Oh yes
one of my favorite places.
Then ah, you have not always lived in Colorado, you have traveled.  Or travel just for vacations.
And vacations to other states, here there is a lot to see, I don't know if you have had the opportunity to see other places here in the United States.
but there are many very beautiful places
oh, no already, not much yet, just Utah, and I don't know, Utah and no the truth that no, to, I went to Washington.
Washington state that is very beautiful there
To Washington, Of course, but no, not to, not to the East, of course, some day I hope to be able to, no.
And how did you come to stay in Idaho?
Oh, to study.
ah
We came here after I graduated from, from high school, to, to study at University here.
yes
A well, it was to Utah, and there I met my husband and now we are living in Idaho.
How great.
But, to Chile we have only gone bak once five years ago and,
And
We hope to go back now, you know, this coming year perhaps.
And it´s very hard to travel from here to there because of things like passports and things like that.
Oh not so much, but it´s more expensive than Idaho, I think that if we were in, Florida, or, or California, me, Colorado is by the North right
Sure it is more or less in the center, we are down below.
In the middle. Oh, ok, then down below, but around the center.
yes, it´s a centrally located for flights, from here they travel a lot to South America.
ohh, then it is easier to, easier to fly
yes for example if I said that I would spend some vacations in Cancun.
right
and went there for three days with around three hundred fifty dollars
oh, no, really.
it would include the hotel and the flight, yes.
Oh, yes, did you see, that´s why we don´t go anywhere, because, only in-uh, anything costs more than three hundred dollars or something. Per ticket, it´s very expensive.
Probably it would be easier for you to go to the State of Washington. Or go to a more centrally located place and fly somewhere else if you´d like to.
yes. And have you traveled outside America, like to Europe or something like that, or you have not had the chance?
No, I´d love to go to Europe, my brothers that, one of them lives in Whichita, Kansas and the other one lives in Puerto Rico, they travel a lot.
Oh yes.
They have gone to the whole Europe and they´ve told me how beautiful it is, right there, Paris, Spain.
What country, what country would you live to travel to if you could?
Well I´d like, one of my favorites is Australia.
And yes, in Australia.
Yes and Australia would be fascinating for me because very exciting there and also New Zealand. But I would also like to visit Italy, Spain, France, all those places, but I think Australia is still number one.
yes look, for me, if I could pick, I think it would be Italy.
Italy yes, Italy is beautiful.
yes, I don't know, Italy, yes I think Italy. But Australia is huge, Australia, there is so much to do there.
It's a lot of history, yes well, I have worked for a company where the president of the company was Australian, and he was the CEO of the company, so there we made great friendship and all that.
And he would always invite me to go there, but I have a daughter of five years, I am a divorced father.
Oh.
And have divided custody.w
of course.
so,
oh, you will stay,
I would never abandon her, never leave her.
Of course. At least for five more years, right.
yes yes, when she forgets she has a father, and starts to think in boyfriends, yes.
Of course when she doesn't want anything to do with you, for a short time, right.
yes yes but right now, well I am crazy for her and she is Crazy for me
Of course, right now is difficult.
We have a great time.
Yes we have small children, too, and that makes it very complicated to travel somewhere else.
yeah right. well I want to go to Puerto Rico next year so that she knows her Puerto Rican half, because her mom is Mexican
ah of course
then i want her to meet that, and she's crazy for going there and meeting her grandma. grandma comes here every year and they do great with each other, there's great chemistry
oh, so you're going to take her there, but what age are you planning to go
she, well, she's travelled so many times on plane
aha
ah, travelled more than me in the last three years because she goes to mexico, with her mother, at least two times a year
Oh look, so she's constantly
Oh, she's well used to travelling, she's really calm, i tell you the first time we travelled, it wasn't on a plan, but when we took a travel to Wichita
hmm
we went on one of those Greyhound and it was an awful experience, because she was very little still, and when she went on the truck
of course
she was asleep, but when she totally woke up she panicked
i can imag-
i think she thought she had a very bad nightmare, and people there was really uncomfortable, and they said stuff
of course
and it was awful that travel, but
oh, i can gue- how old was she?
she was like two years old there
oh, so little, she didn't understand yet, of course
yes And I promised her that I was never going to take her in one of those buses there, we call them buses.
aha
then, well, the next time we went on a plane, a little plane and, and we had a great time and she was very happy.  And, not to mention it was only,
one hour of travel, compared to thirteen hours, when we took the bus
ah, yes, that is so.
yes
No, but it's great that people like traveling because, that way she is going to want to travel, because there are people who really do not like traveling and cannot believe that
it was horrible.
Who don't  like to travel
I would love to see the whole plane if I could.
Of course.
Because I would love to travel all I coud, but really, the economy.  And situations it is very difficult for me.
Of course, you have to be here responsible and already one who has children.
yes exactly.
put your feet on the ground for a while.
yes exactly, bes but, you have, if you have the opportunity go to other places, come to Colorado because Colorado is very beautiful.
I have heard it is really slow.
It is beautiful, you come here,
Many woods, no
it has many national forests, they have majestic mountains, they have attraction points also in the city, they have many things, they have a little bit of everything.  But you go here in the mountains, and you go to places that are fabulous, the beauty as is you were in a paradise.
And how long have you lived there in Colorado.
I've been living here twenty-six years.
wow
It'll be twenty-six in December, yes. Well yes, I came directly, well I stopped for a while in New York for a very short time.
mm
Then I came here with my first ex-wife.
mm
Then we were married like ten years, then we each went our separate way.
oh, and she was American or, Where was she from?
But, she was half Puerto Rican and half Swiss.
ah,
she was, my high school sweet heart
oh yes,
yes well we got along well, and we ended it fine is that at the end we realized we had different goals.
of course, well is that one changes a lot, no.
Change a lot, yes, yes.
in those years.
The mother of my daughter, it was a super short marriage.
Sure.
It didn't even last two years.
or yes oh, and she is from Mexico.
Yes she is from Oaxaca Mexico.
yeah
But we have a good father relation with the girl we work very well with her together.as in fact today we went to her Kindergarden School
mhm
then lets see what the teacher told us, and the teacher gave a, a good report on the girl. because my girl is a good girl,she has a good heart,and
She has a very sweet voice that all the world love
How rare,no yes is very rich.
Has,acts real good, she's very respectful,is a has much love of God and she has you know good principals and she is hungry to learn.
Now where does she live?
in ,My ex husband you say?
yeah,with the girl.
she lives close to here, I live in Aurora,Colorado and she lives about three miles from there.
ah,then you can see her often.
yes I see her three times a week every week.more on other activities like today for example, well,
ah look how father.
we share together with her.
look how good.
yes that is good.
And it will be pretty.now when,if you are from Puerto Rico it does not cost you to come in and out of United States,right
No absolutly.
I have never understood what is United States stand with Puerto Rico, because it is not a state it is a separate Country, but at the same time.
Well it was invaded by Americans in eighteen thousand and ninety eight.
Yeah
They took away from the Spanish from there they established American governors and from there they dominated until they started to gover-have Puerto Rican governors,
Like in Nineteen fifty four they have Puerto Ricans citizenship.
Oh it has not been that long.
But Puerto Rico, no not that long for example when my parents were born were not citizens but I have been a citizen my entire life.
sure
en then from then forward they started free commerce which is a free association with United States but without being a state.
Overthere they vote on the primary, they vote on the primary for The president from here, but they do not vote in the president elections here.
Then in some way it is Independent, in some way has lots.
oh
In dependent  or union with United States would be very difficult because Puerto Rico would beecame a totally independent Country because,
Independent.
They would have to approve first there but they have never approved and never been approved
Good evening Mildred of Connecticut
Hello, how are you? what is your name?
Mildred.
Mildred, I'm Arturo.
Where are you from Arturo?
I'm from Mexico but right now I'm in Philadelphia
Oh okay, and we talked, or not.
Maybe that's it.
Forgive me
I think if I did not, where are you? of Puerto Rico
yes
eh, if you talk
Puerto Rican mhm
I play that you speak of, I do not agree that, all I remember now is the music
today is the music
yes it is very good music, right,
Do you like it?
A lot
mhm
You touch an instrument or
What type of music do you listen to?
Well, I like it all, eh, music, jazz, I like a bit of classical music, I listen to contemporary music, alternative and fusion music, like
it's like a merger of jazz with funk
Rock and all that, ah,
a bit of everything, what do you listen to?
Reaggeton and all that
no, do you like Reggaeton?
ah,
Do you like Reggaeton?
yes I do, I listen to everything. Reggaeton, Rap, everything
yes, sure
Rock, I don't like it that much but I do listen to it, I can't listen to it for a long time, just a bit. I can spend a whole night listening to Rock music, no.
I'm not a Rocker.
Oh, I'm, I do like Rock.
I do like Bachata, Merengue, Salsa, everything, classical music.
yes
Romantic music, nice, yes, I think that music lets you know a bit about other cultures, it helps get to know people from other countries.
yes, yes, but
And
lately I think that is being forgotten, nowadays, music is mainstream, like Hip-Hop, now, I mean everyone is making the same music.
in the United States, in Mexico, they are, they are just copying it, they are using as a, I mean, it's become like a global gender.
Everybody, I've listened to it, I think, I don't really like it but it is impressive that everybody is now listening to Hip-Hop.
in the music, I think it's like Reggaeton, it's becoming popular
aha, aha
in Mexico, Mexican music uses lots of Hip-Hop and there are lots of rock bands that use Hip-Hop or stuff like that
I think that it is helping bringing people together, even if they are from many different nations, Mexican people like salsa, some others that are from
yes
different countries like salsa too, merengue, bachata and when you go to dances, well
yes, yes
there
yes, I do enjoy dancing merengue and salsa music too
are people from many different countries dancing.
yes
I like it, I like Mexican music because it has a good rythm, I like Ranchera music, I love it, yes
yes, Rancheras
I like them a lot
yes, they are good, I do like them too but sometimes I don't know they tunes, it's interesting to get to know music from other countries like
have you ever listened to Arab or Turkish music?
yes, aha
Interestingly, it's good too.
Yes, very beautiful, very beautiful, and the Chinese also, the chinese music
Yes yes
Yes, especially o if someone knew how to interpret, well it would be more beautiful because they always present like a history when they do presentations, of them with the women that are moving their hands
Yes, and those fans
Yes, yes yes, yes
They use it like, in order to tell a story
Yes, good well everyone, since they tell something with music, also the music has no lyrics, so also they are painting an image or something, like
this, a scenery, having lyrics always makes it related to feeling or story, or the Mexican music like the corridos
They are very well know because they tell stories of different people and of different things that have happened, but they are very singular stories, very good sometimes
We are brought to old times, with the natives doing their
Yes
their dances and everything, and the slaves were the first that used music in order to complain, in order to be able to say
Yes
the evil with which they were treated, they were expressing all of their
Ah
their discontent
Yes yes yes
I believe that music will always continue for centuries and centuries, you know
Clearly
even though its different, in the type that they choose, it will always unite the people because wherever you go, you hear reggaeton and already you know who it was, and sometimes
yes already
I don't know if you remember that Japanese band the band of light
I see
that they began to play salsa
no no if
yes, and they were Japanese and spent a lot of time here and I didn't know that they would last but they played a lot in New York and they didn't have discos when they originally played.
the same salsa discos that they did in Japanese music
Oh Japanese
or they would be safe that if a Japanese came here to America they would say o well he is dancing.
no I've never heard them
they can say it although they don't understand
I see
mhm I already think that it's pretty and relaxing music.
yes yes me too
One of it's uses is to relax.
It's very relaxing for distractions.
I have discos while going out in Puerto Rico with the music that came that was recorded in Rio.
ah
Its one to relax to
yes
when you want to be quiet at home you can light those scented candles and relax.  That helps a lot
aha yes like pure ambient sounds or that are
mmm OK and you need music, you need music because it is what maybe if we had music people would be like a
even a little more aggressive too
yes, no well it is that music is
Because music calms you down
also even music that is very, eh, this aggressive helps to relieve, no, also music can be very important also like for liberation like
there is a singer whose music is called Afro bit, his name is Cela Kuti and this gentleman, well in, he for the civil war of, of, of Nigeria
he was very important because him with all his music, he made revolutionary movements, I mean people didn't, didn't, didn't see him as a musician but rather as a political leader.
aha
that, that through the music he moved people.  Then when he released new albums
um
the, the military was infuriated and some times he I mean, he had the entire community, like practicing with him, who had the same political philosophy.
and all of them lived together in communities and when he released an album called Zombie that criticized the army, because they were like a puppet of the government that was
like killing people of their own race
oh
he said everything in his song and the military heard it and
yes almost always, how do you say it they extradite him from the country, they, they vote them
yes yes, they threw him away, he, well, they jailed him and beat him and burned his whole house and all the
yes because it was protest music they called it, true
exactly, the music.
in Puerto rico they had topo, the topo, and who else sang that kind of protest music? juan Manuel sang protest songs, and sometimes made concerts.
ha yes of course
but like they sang the truth about villages
yes that it
against the government, and all that, they are the
people that make a riot out of everything, and the government doesn't like that.
they try to to make people not go to those kinds of things.
yes
but its interesting because they make history.
yes of course, it gets involved in history as well, music will always reflect what other people are living in the moment, and what they think.
mhm yeah, i think that same thing. i think that
yeah, that's good
like, they they they need music.
yeah, always
they tell love stories, disgraces, people problem.
yes
daily life has many uses.
yes, yes everything mh, yes yes yes i think its necessary that we need air to live.
yeah yeah, i think that, i love music i think that when i put it on, i clean the house faster.
and if, you don't play music, you dont play an intrusment.
no i mean, I've always liked the piano, and my daughters like piano classes, i never had the opportunity of my mom paying for piano classes for me.
yeah
i like playing the guitar and the violin
oh the violin
the violin is, is an instrument that i don't know so much about, but it has precise music.
yeah, not that much, i had a friend at school, that knew how to play the violin really good.
yeah the violin is good, you know what i like as well, accordion music, i live it as well.
yea but, like you said Mexican music uses a lot of accordions.
ha yeah but in Puerto rico people we call it 'gicaro' of land, when they go out for Christmas and all that.
yeah yeah yeah
but you dontp lay an instrument
an i play the guitar, base, and i try playing the piano, but its too hard, i cant
so i just left it there
my boyfriend plays it, my boyfriend plays base, but he used to not anymore, hes older now
ha
but
yeah
he played with bands, and groups, he played the base
its always good to play music, i think
hmm
also that serves on to let it off one's chest whe, when I want to get distracted or something since I take my bass and I play a little, and
I see, it relaxes you
it distracts me, if it relaxes me
I see that is good
yes
that is good I lea- here we have a lot
hmm
because he, he does -DJ-
oh
is does - DJ so, there is music around the whole house
oh, okay
and every, is all the time on the internet recording records and
yes
and we make records for for people if they want
aha
sometimes we have done parties and we do is that he records a cd full of songs and we give it to the person as a gift
yes
aha
to father is my uncle does something very similar as well, he ehm he, also it was like - dj
ahhhh
but now he had not work so much, he is with othe jobs, but but he also record

Like at twenty five years right
yes, more or less. Could be
Y com-
What, speaking of tonight's topic
yes, how's there, how is where do you live ? It's a big city, in the city, or live outside?
Right Denver is a city pretty big, but then, nos-
Ah
i live in Aurora that is nearby Denver
Aha
it's a city too, pretty big, but it doesn't have tall buildings like Denver
Ah, and a little more quiet
I wouldn't say that is more quiet, i would say
Ah
because, it has a mixture of all,
Hmm
good people, bad ones, every ethnic group, you have, high crimes around too, and you seem to live a little fear
Hmm
Then, yes, i lived in home before. No i live in an apartment, and, i found some nasty situations around here
Ah yeah ?
including gun shots and things like that.
oh, and would you like to live, what kind of place would you like living in?
well, if i could go, i would go to a calmer place, a small village, rather than a city.
oh
because i am tired of the city, i drive here every day, and the traffic in denver is horrible.
yeah
too many cars, and where my girl goes, school, it takes me a long time, and I'm sometimes waiting for about an hour and half just driving, before going to work.
wow
yah its a little bit, and when you arrive to work. you're all stressed out.
a headache
with a big headache, yes
that's a big difference, its super calm here.
yes
really really calm.
what? is it a village?
well idaho, yeah in general Idaho is mainly land i would say.
yes
I man the biggest city boyce
yes, over there yes
but its a relaxed city and it kind of small
yes
And that is the biggest city. After the one that follows I would say is Idaho, Idaho Falls But, I consider that it is like a big town.
yes
Because it's not a city, city, and, but it's, it's like there are no big buildings, or things like that, or buildings really,
yes
and, but uh, so there is, it's like what is here, it's a big town. But mm
And how is the crime, and things like that?
oh nothing happens. Here people live, leave the doors open, the cars unlocked,
Oh how cool.
And
Ah, that doesn't happen here in Aurora
of course, it's very very peaceful. No dad- Look, the daily news here, uh talk of ah, someone lost something. I mean the news, no, nothing, no nothing happens, if
if something did happen it would be the news of the
They're not about crimes, nor any of that.
of course, of the month, no, nothing, absolutely nothing.
Wow what, what, what most delicious thing.
Sometimes too quiet
Well I'm going over there then, to be your neighbors.
yes, it's super peaceful. And people, a lot of people live in the countryside. So, they live it's, it's, it's peaceful, super super peaceful.
It's all the opposite of Denver
Eh, yes
And Aurora.  Aurora
As I tell you, it is too, too quiet.  There, and there is not much to do, I mean, here the people who live here, they like things outdoors, like
yes
camping, and fishing, and going to the mountains to ski, and
No, people in Colorado too.  Eh, mm, eh, here, mm, we like going to the mountains a lot, camping, all that
Of course, well
well there are people everywhere, and
Of course
many places that who have come these people, they have brought many bad habits too.
Of course
Then, well things happen that, they make you live in fear,
Of course
with my daughter I am always in fear, because there is a lot of talk on the news of what happens a crime in Aurora
Of course
What yes, shots, that they stole this, that they ran over a kid, and the, the driver of the car is on the flight.
Of course
Things like that.
Like like city city, then
Sorry?
We, I used to live, when I used to live in Chile, I lived in Santiago for a while, it's the capital.
yes
And sure, it's different to live in a city. I mean, you can't leave your doors open. You can't, can't trust no one, usually. And
The cars, you can't leave you car, the CDs.
Sure
in the car or things like that because they break the windows to steal them
Everything
the CDs, and
Yes, that doesn't happen everyone, but
I never leave anything flashy in the car.
Sure, no, it's quite safe in here. For me, it's too quiet for me, but, it's okay because I have kids now so it's a good place to raise kids
Ah, that's good. I dream of a place like that. The only problem is
That's why
I have, a divorced father, I have a daughter
Sure
and she and I, I mean my ex-wife we share custody
You have to be close to
yes, I, I would never leave my girl behind. I want to stay near her until she grows up.
Sure
and one day she'll get married and forget about me! I hope not, but, I know that's what happens most of the time.
Well it happens a lot
yes
But, nothing, I would like to, live in a more quiet place.  My brother lives in Kansas
Aha
and it is very quiet there, also.
Of course, no.
They have festivals, people are more quiet no.
A little more relaxed
yes, here there many beautiful things.  Not everything here is, is ugly or anything like that, but
Of course
it is that since there are people living and more people moving, and the, and, and the city I mean, there are cities in Colorado that are more the ones growing the most of all America,
Of course
In- eh, that also has its problems.
yes, and that is what I miss.  Because here there is a lot to do.  Besides the things you do outdoors, there is no opera here, there is not, eh, places to
the mall is very small, there are no places to visit, or, places, ballet or, concerts and things like that.  Those things are not around here.
Then one, the city, you know as I tell you, pulsy or City that are in Utah
yes
and, and, if you like to do things like that, go to concert, or go to see you know an opera, theatre, or anything like that, a show
no, there is not, you have to drive like four hours, three hours, to, to see something like that.  Nothing happens here.  The only thing the universities here, have those tiny shows, and things like that, but
you miss that from, from the city, no, that
yes
that you can find that type of fun stuff but, at the same time there is
No, here you have the apposite. Here they have
ah, with all the tranquility and other. I liked that allot, when we lived in Utah
yes
ah, in the city you have all that you want
yes
and it's quiet
And it's, right, you have lots of relaxing parts. And there it has lots of family attractions,
Right
for adults, for singles, everything. In reality you have all that right here we i work, it's a high-tech company area of
Aha
then, too, you have an amphitheater too one block from my work, and sometimes we hear the concerts while working
Right
From the building
yes you see, i would like to live near things like that, that have activities and stuff
yes, and no, here you don't miss that, the activities. The only thing es, particularly in the city i live, you have lots of crimes. I would like
you have parts of, of right here, border areas too that are fairly quiet and
Hmm
with good neighbors. Even though there are lots of people, they care each other pretty well, and like you say they have their cars open, without fear of robbery and stuff like that.
Of course
In this, which is, as a limit to, it is a mixture of good and bad.
Of course
Understand, and the bad ones well they are the ones who like to take advantage.
Of course
And you live well in fear, and, calm.
Of course
But traffic is horrible, let me tell you.
Well yes I don't really miss.
It is it is really horrible.  Because sometimes taxi drivers and on winter days it is still worse.  Because when there start to be all these accidents and you cannot move on the highway
Ah, snow and ice and all that.  Ah
it is terrible.
Oh, yes that is not at all strange
But I always dream like that with a quiet place.  Some day I think that whatever, it is going to be possible. In, in
Well yes because when already the, when already and where your daughter lives, she lives very close too, no?
She lives very close.  Like at one, not even two miles of distance from here.
Ah.
In what was my home, mm.  And also to the home of my ex-wife, which was my house then, they came in also.  One time, they came in through the
the, because the house has three levels.
Aha
and the basement, its like isn't an basement. What did it stay up the windows
OK
then they get in for the back and the basement, i mean the below of the house, and steal a lot of things of it
oh Werent they in the house? Did They
no, she had been gone with some coworker. i went to the house and inspected, and gave her my recomendations that she will have to lock this and that because
it doesn't let it exposed to the thiefs right
sure
then she did it like that. also in her car, in her workplace, where she is parking is not a very good place. they have get in her car about three times
oh that's makes me angry
three times they have broken her windows, took her cds, they had rob her stereo
that's make me angry
yes, that's the bad thing of live in the city. you have any kind of atracctions but there is much
sure you have to
desadvantages
you have to be careful
i missed
sure, here you relax, and that's the problem, because there are somebody who comes from other place that take advantage of the circunstances. The people trust too much
exactly
they relax and everything else
hey you have
and
sorry, continue
oh, for example when that happened, the news here were that this man came and killed his family, and he took away two kids
oh, i remember that
yes, because, precisely, they are living here in the field and the children, you never know that somebody like that can come over here
yes
and
yes, crime could happen anywhere
sure
It is sad, that one
And you have to be careful always
And don't be so trusting with certain people, strangers specially
Sure, so
I always teach my daughter to don't be trusting with strangers and be very careful
yes, but you realize until it when you have kids, then you start to worry, that's terrible
You start to teach them, they don't have to knock here or there
Sure, when you have kids, at least you can take care yourself, but
yes
when you daughters, not any more
Hello, good afternoon.
Hello? Good afternoon. What?
Maira habla.
Ah, Maira, ah, How are you? It's Jose.
Memo. You're Memo?
Hello? Um?

Good.
And how are you? How are your classes?
Me? Good. Everything's going good, with this, I just got done with all the exams and well you see that I'm in that week where at least, you can can't really do anything.
Uhum, uhum.
And, well, the weather outside, I'd tell you that I haven't got used to it yet. It gets me down.
Oh, no.
I swear, in the morning I turn the window and get, get angry, ay, not again
No, but, but, where are you from? or where do you live?
Ah, I'm in the high-rises, yeah
eh, before coming here?
yes, where?
Be-, Before coming here to study?
No, no, no. I lived, before coming here, I lived in Singapore for 2 years. And before that it was Ciudad de Mexico, all my life.
ah, then that's it
yes
it's very hot. Or it's hotter here
yes, well, yes. I've getting used to, to tropics
It's very hot in Singapur, right?
then, it's tropical, nothing else, then
yes
yes, I came and it was like today, what's going on?
ah, and then here, it's cold and
yes
eh
And in the air it rains for a week, I don't understand how they can survive this time
no, there's cold, and yes, there's no sunlight. Ah, after the summer it feels nice. But a, a week like that, a little cold
so, uh, ah not a lot. I like that but, ah, yes, it is only the beginning right? of a terrible winter.
yes
Then, but, that is what I don't like, but
yes, yes, yes.What happens is that the cold, if you can stand,let's say until December, Christmas is gone and after when, what happens is that
when you return, you think, well Christmas is over.And say, the cold is finish
Uhum
The cold is for Christmas and you return and is worse. Then it is when it really hits, and leaves me like knocked
Ah
yes, yes please
Yes, I know My brother studies in Cornell.Which is farther north, about six hours from Philadelphia, but is
much further north
yes
And it is so cold that classes don't start until the end of January, until maybe the 28Th. of January
Wow Really?
yes, yes, he says that it is so cold that it is better to spend more days in May than to spend the days in January Right? The students Because...
Wow, aha
...they are, the cold in Cornell is brutal, the cold in Philadelphia can be endured right? The cold in Cornell is too much.
It can not be
And my brother.
And I was thinking about going there. Good that I didn't go, I couldn't survive.I swear that I wouldn't survive.
Really, and my brother, well, he was lucky enough to get a, what they call a town house
Yeah
but, it was a lot bigger, then you went in and they had a little living room and a kitchen, and then you went up and they had all the rooms but
it was pretty big, but the problem is, they were some of the university's new dormitories
Ah
and they had built it in in, uh, in the university's outskirts, so it was pretty far from the university. And his classes
were engineering classes that were held at the other side of the university
Ouch, poor guy
And I say, that he's, I mean, right? Then I say, there's there's a bus system there, like
public transportation there, why don't you use it? No, I don't want to pay the fifty dollars, do you understand?
Oh
right, then he, he spend the whole semester walking, and during the winter, it was like twenty degrees, and he walked, he walked forty minutes to get to class
ouch, my brother
ouch, poor guy
No, it's
he brought it on himself
Because, it's, he's just cheap, right? he didn't want to pay the fifty dollars, so I said, I, that's ridiculous, so I said
no, because the bus only stops four times every hour, so he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes, something like that
Oh
I mean, my brother, I don't know
What grade is your brother in?
No, but um, now he is in the eight grade.
Ah, Ok.
Yes, yes, but
That's fine.
and and what do you think about the crime wave here in Philadelphia?
About what? about the crime wave?
Eh,the crime wave, yes.
I have not heard much about it here in Philly or rather I have heard that were some persons who are rob on forty first or whatever,
Uhum.
but I think that I have always been lucky because I have been walking at night alone on forty first and like going to the store
to the fruit shops on forty eighth and I go there whenever and nothing has ever happened to me.
and you walk to forty eighth?
Yes,additionally by myself. as happy as ever with my life, besides not even, I don't even think about it not even paying attention, I don't walk around in fear or anything like that
oh.
and nothing has ever happened to me I have no reason to, be scared of anything, to the contrary,once I get there they are all super friendly.
Then, I don't know, I think that
yes, yes.
I think I'm lucky because is the same in Mexico. In other words, all my friends in Mexico have a story about been rob or kidnapped or something that they have done to them.
And nothing has ever happened to me, I am always alone at late hours of the night in bad areas, so and so all those things they say you shouldn't do
Uhum, uhum.
I've done all of them at the same time and nothing has happened to me.
The
yes, it's like, trust me, that I see what has been done, yes, I remember what I have done and I say to myself, "how did I dare to do that?"
What was I thinking? Wow, I was a very irresponsible teenager but, you know, nothing happened to me.
Eh.
So, I don't know, I don't feel insecure, I have lots of reasons, but you do? Have you met Philly
Mm, good, I don't, to me
Ah, yes, what's it like?
to me, it's like, it's the same old story, right? Nothing has happened to me either so, sure, I think I  live in
here, close to the university, I live in Walnut, the thirty eight, between the thirty eight and the thirty nine.
Aha.
So, it's not that far away and there are lots of police here, so, in general, I haven't me anyone that has gone through that, so I really think that
sure, it does happen, right? I read it in the paper and
yes.
I think that in general, it's kind of weird because in, around here, we have so much security, there are lots of cameras
yes, we do too.
and, lights, and they have some phones, well people, or the, the cops they have byke, it's unbelievable, they have
they spend lots of money in that but in general, they are keeping us safe.
yes, yes, they have lots of them.
and i imagine that, that the people from the neighborhood for example, criminals, right? know that, that they have to be careful with the security in this area.
and i think that they can, um, mm to the people that do crimes, so i don't know, in general, its very safe.
in the, quad, because before that it was security, no no it wasn't so strict, because one had to pass there, and one gave the card to someone else.
and then they would go get him, whats his name? the system, to see if one was actually a student from there, or not.
that they didn't make an illegal copy of it, right? but now
OK
the thing is that people could have gone in and out like nothing, but they now have those systems, those new doors, that
you cant do anything at all, right? so in general, they don't worry about someone in the university.
yes
um
yes, in general my, in philadelphia, there are a few zones were I'm wouldn't go.
yes
I don't like it, i mean, like at night like in the center city there are a few places where i dont like walking too.
no, um
but i don't know, i dont really know the city well, i dont know the people here
yes
i mean, in mexico, i would see someone, and then cross the street or not.
uhum
and here its like i don't know, its like I'm scared about something, or someone.
yes, yes
well, no no no
well Philadelphia has lots of neighborhood that are dangerous because
yes
they have, they are, they have secure neighborhoods, right? so one has too, from the university, that is also in general, secure, but
yes one goes north, north philly, all that then south philly, and west philly, its not necessary
so it really gets dangerous, so, it does for example, if one wants to go out at night, they wont go to north philly, so its not that,
important right?
uhum
well, for us
yes me too.
yes, why yes, if one goes out, one goes to philadelphia, but that's an old city, so they have cops and everything.
so
but, why don't you know anyone in Philadelphia that knows history about robberies.
yes, um in general, there aren't really many students in the old city, the majority of the students stay in the university.
uhum OK
i think, um yeah in general, but people complain too much that there's no security because we live in a bad neighborhood.
But in general, i mean there is, every week, one read the the the, so, there is, once a
there was a robbery, or something, so one goes, and naturally thinks, whats happening. right? but
uhum
in reality its im, one thinks that they will get jumped, or will jump two hundred students, but there's twenty thousand students, so the probability is that,
that, that happens to one
yes, also
of course it exists, right? but is not that, that tall
Of course, also they are in a lot and neither is it that much more expensive that happens if you are walking alone or in
yes, yes
the forty-third, that is how it always happens like that since yes they can not do that either, no
yes, yes, yes, but that also seems to me, me that it is better to live like that in like, something like univeristy high-rises because no, especiall if one returns over there in, at, in the night and
yes, it is very calm
is that, is, ehm, yes, well it is nice to have to
Do not worry about anything
to walk for a long time, the people that live like that in Baltimore but the squares in Baltimore are huge, they must over there that
yes.  And there is not light.
yes, huge.  Uhm?
And no light.
There is no light, there is no light.
On the blocks
yes, there is no light, yes.  And, but in high-rises it is better, more calms one does not have to buy uhm all of the furniture
Uhum
ehm, if something happens, one calls the university and they take care of them
yes
but and, and one has to, to also there are a lot I've heard a lot of stories like of problems between people that, that share an apartment
Hi
Hi, who am I talking to?
Hi, I am Olaya, in Philadelphia
Olaya, I am Arthur
Are you spanish?
Eh, no, I am from Mexico
Ah, okay okay, very well, nice to meet you. And from where are you calling?
From Philadelphia as well, in fact, yes
Also, good
What do you do in Philadelphia, work or study?
Right now I am studying
Ah, okay

Ah, me too
Yes, what do you do?
Yes. Chemical engineer. An undergraduate
Ah
And you?
I am in the linguistics program
Ah, okay. Do you have something to do with this program?
No, that is, I know people who wear it and I know the LDC and what they do.
Ah, okay.
But, no.
And p- and p- and, or, how final are they making this program, or what is
Well, the LDC, what they do is collect many types of linguistic data, whether that's text, like it might be tex- um, something spoken, and then, it can be used for, for many things, for, for example,
A-
uh, programs that, that can understand voice, nee- need training, they don't need
Oh, okay. Oh
a sample, let's say.
Okay, okay.
And, it- then, um, for example, for this it's possible and, and, for studies of for example how people pronounce the letter this way, up to the dialog, how it develops, I don't know, what, or, for
Uh huh. Wow.
for many things. And the LDC, they do this, they collect data for many languages, and, and then, the people,
Aha.
can do more things, more applications or more studies, more theories. Right?
More specialized.
Mhmm, yes, yes.
Wow, okay. Oh, and this, where you live here in Philadelphia, in what neighborhood, or?
Well, I live in, in West Philly, but, well, not very west, let's say I live at forty-third and Spruce.
Oh, okay. Well, yes, that is, that is not not that west, like you say.
No, no too much west
yes, yes i live in campus
And, aha, aha
But i live high, 40th floor
Mhm
in the skyscrapers
Mhm, mhm
And, how do you feel the air living so high at 43th ?
Well, i like it allot, like before i come here
yes
they told me, good, that Philadelphia was little dangeous and such, and
yes
caution with West Philly, including the guide that spread in the campus they say it's dangerous go out at night
Aha
Right, this is my second year now
Mhm
and i, trully, i didn't see nothing and no bad things happened to me, i don't feel unsafe either, in general. Could be that
don't know, because i watch few things, the news around here they scare you a bit
yes, that too
and i don't know, i say nothing bad happened to me ever, and i, would say i feel safe, i don't feel like being in danger. But i know people that do feel like that, they get scared about West Philly, and
yes, THe people, the black people, no ? there are lots of them that gets intimidated by the black people here.
yes, but, right, mm
Eh to me
that is, that is his problem, no ? like, i don't know
yes, right. No, but like, how allot of people associates West Philly, with, then, the neighborhood like it were a ghetto, no ? how
Mhm, mhm
the the neighborhood of the black, and then, unsafe
yes, mhm, mhm, that too
But
Like, tell me, tell me
like, i, i don't feel to intimidated and all that because i have a friend who live near forty-five
Mhm
and, i walk over there frequently. And, at night too, and all
Mhm
and i meet allot of people too, there, sometime, at night, because, i have to cross the, the park
yes
and that, and there are lots of people, there too, at night, then, at two in the morning they are rumbling there and, then, they
never threatened me, not even, like, they never ask for a cigarette and something like that, then yeah
Mhm, mhm, mhm
No, like, in, truly no, i don't see them provoking, there, like
No. Let's see, it's true that things happen, I do, I do know a girl that, that was attacked. No?
Ah, OK.
And, but, those things happen in every city, I don't know.
Yes, all. Yes, yes, yes.
And, in every city there are, there are crimes and, and I don't know, but I do believe that here,
yes, aha
they give it much attention, and it's repeated a lot, no? and it shows up on TV, and in the newspapers, and then, it ends up creating a state of a bit collective, of
yes, yes.
of psychosis, no? and,
yes, I think it's, as you say, like it's exaggerated. So, people on their own make
yes.
like the, the, the idea that it's very unsafe. But, in truth no, it's not so much. I mean, it's more the idealization, like of what they are thinking,
Mhm, mhm.
they are making it more serious than it truly is.
Mhm. And, West Philly, I don't know, I think it's a neighborhood very, it doesn't have very nice areas, but it has some very nice areas and, and very nice to stroll around.
yes, yes.
And, I don't know, there are people that live in Center City, that never used to happen, no? to come to have a stroll around here.
that no.
And, and I don't know, I think that it's a nice neighborhood, to tell you the truth.
yes, I don't, I don't dislike it at all
mhm
I mean, Its not particularly pretty, or nothing, but, i mean, its like you say, there's some good places to walk a bit, and
And well, living here as a university student, well um, um, everyone lives here, so, at the same time, you don't want to be too far away from here, because then you get disconnected from the university place and students.
yeah yeah yeah, mhm
me too, i think,
yes
that's why the people that live in universities find it comforting.
mm, i for once,went traveling to sesenta street, or something like that. i kept going, then i left.
oh yeah
i wanted too see what was going on, and
and what did you find?
And then i found a neighborhood, a poor neighborhood, it was ugly, a few houses were old, or not taken care off, i mean
ha
You could see it was poor, in a few places.
yes
but, but there wasn't anything disgusting, or something scary, i don't know, you could have seen,
yeah, right?
well,well that's the income for those kinds of neighborhoods, less than others.
They make a lot less, yes
and,and of course, there aren't any white people on the streets.
yes, yes, yes.
those are the things that have surprised me the most about Philadelphia, no?  The, the division so large that there is still.
yes, is that what an impressing displacement.  That is
yes, . Hmm
that is, to- yes it is impressing to see that, like the more you go to the, the west, well, more black people you start to have, and every time there are less Whites
Hmm, hmm.  yes, really, and sometimes, it is curious, mm, I mm, ahm, I take the bus here, here in front of my house, and sometimes, when I get on the bus, well, everybody is black, and the, the bus, goes like changing colors no? as it continues advancing
yes, yes, yes
that advan- that you go eastbound, and when you go westbound, is the opposite, it is one thing
yes, yes, yes.  It is true, I have used the bus just one time.  But, But I do recall, as well, of getting on.  And, then, then noticing that
everybody was black when Iwas going to the eas- to the west
yes, yes, yes.  It is strange
yes, but, well, that, that  too, well, it is like as a result of that I mean, the fact that the majority of the, of the black people here, well, is, is of the lesser income.  Then, well
Sure, sure.  It is a, is a relationship with social class, No? more, more than something racial, it is clear, yes.
Sure.  Yes, more than anything.  It is simply just that.  But,
Where you from M- from Mexico?
from the city.  From Mexico City.
They say that it is dangerous, No?? Or, that it is
yes, yes, over there, over there is a lot more serious the, the ehm, the issue,  That is, it is not as bad as here, that, that, ehm, that is, over there yes seriously
hmm
and especially, there continues to be like a lot of segregation, ehm, of, of social classes.  And, is is very evident, that is, it is,
OK.  Mmh, Pe-
I am from a, I have like a, an appearance that is much more, this, European, let's say.  I am, I am blond, with white screen and light eyes,
Mmh, mmh. Mmh.
and if I walk through some neighborhood, there in Mexico, kind of unsafe,
Mmh, mmh.
be sure that I am not going to go out with a purse
wow
or, I mean, but in, I, of of one hour.  I mean, no, it is not going to take long to catch me.
Aha, aha. Aha,
And, they might even kidnap me.  I mean, it is more probable that they kidnap me.
That I had also heard.  I mean, kidnappings like that
yes, it is impressive.  Now, it is- it is- it is interesting, because of the kidnappings, who they kidnap.  I mean, it is no longer because you are from a family
OK, OK, OK, OK.
prominent one, nothing, whoever, they take him in a care, they take him, and they call it express kidnapping.  Then, they, they, they take you, and the take what they can.  I mean, since a few,
Wow.
thousands of dollars, unti, if you have much more, well, you, you have it.  But, what you have.  I mean, no longer, people are
Mmh.
like very desperate.  The, that, they do, they do brutal things, the truth.  And, it is
Mmh, mmh.
it is terrible.  But, well, this, but, well, the truth, I mean, in the end, also there has been too much social conscience regarding the, the citizens, this, now they are starting, let's say, to oppose that, you understand me?  Then,
People testify the, the, the attacks, people now do oppose,
Mhm
I mean, there have been much more, much more involvement. Because, before if was like, well, nobody,
And people didn't do it before, no, no were afraid to report
yes, because, yes, right?And because the truth, also, the, the security system was hardly, didn't work. So, someone declares a crime, and
hm
it was a lot of paperwork that I don't know-that didn't work
yeah, yeah, yeah, Mhm
But, then, lately, you have been, well, let's say, a little bit more, well reaffirming the action, of, the policemen, and things like that. And, trying to
Mm, mm.
To catch more thieves and kidnappers. And much more, with that. So, people feel that there's more response,  to all that
Mm, mm.
before those reports
Mm,
Before it was not so much. But, even then, and also, for example there was a march in, in Mexico, a couple of years ago,
Mhm
About one and half years ago. That was called the Silent March for the Security of Mexico, where everybody walked to, to
to the city Zocalo
Mm
And there were millions of people, it was crowded
wow. Mhm, mhm
i mean, you can see them, everyone dressed in white, and everyone in the streets
Wow, impressive
then, you can realize that is real, something socially needed. I mean, people is already
Mhm, mhm
much more attention to the security
Mhm, mhm. And, no
anything else
i don't know how is in Mexico. But, looks to me, the TV, i mean
causes the fear, right?. because news are like very local and very
yes
each robbery, they explain it in different ways, and then they explain it again and again
yes, yes, yes, yes
actually
yes too much sensationalism, let's say, right?
yes, yes, yes, yes
But, yes, yes
And,
Well yes,in Mexico no that much, because it is very excessive that
OK
practically impossible to include every robbery or every
hmmm, hmmm
every, uhm, rape, or every, I don't know
hmmm
every mugging there is, know what I mean? then it's just the ones that are really really big. That is, when there's a kidnapping
Sure
very drastic kidnappings, or when it's like, the, the case of the Juarez deaths, that are
Alex, ah, Besy.
I see, it's Javier.
Oh, hello.
Hello, how are you? Eh, this. Eh, I think this is good, I've never served as a jury but I'd like to do it someday, I don't know if you
Ah, no, I got a letter last year
ah, did you?
but, I, to serve on a jury but I refused
Ah. No, eh, you know, I've heard that it's quite hard because, it causes lots of trouble
Mhm.
because, I mean, maybe you have problems, I don't know, you have to, I think, they have like your record, your info about Courts, it's safer that way, I don't know
I don't know, I see, I mean, serving on a jury, it's dangerous because it depends on which case you are serving
I mean, it's a, a
I see.
if you get a murder case, I mean, or someone from the, ah, the, that sells drugs, the
yes, yes.
How do they call it? the
Um, oh well, a drug dealer or something
I see. They can have friends, bah, let's say, you say, okay he's guilty, so he can talk to his friends and say "go after this person and kill his children or his"
Oh, I see, I see, you are so right! NO, well they can say, she looks like this and
aha, yes
I mean, they can make your description and
Mhm.
they can, that could happen too but, but I don't know, they say that, that, that, I mean, it's optional if you, they send you a letter
Aha.
eh, is it optional or mandatory? I'm nos sure, really.
No, well, I got a letter, that, I said no, but I sent a letter to from doctor
Aha.
saying that I wasn't supposed to sit down for long periods of time because, because I'm sick and I can't sit down that long, I can't walk long periods of time, nor be standing for long periods of time.
Oh.
so, they said it was fine, they said it was okay for me not to serve on a jury
Sure, it's
That was last year, so
OH, yes, it's like, a friend of mine got a letter like that but he's working, from six in the morning to four in the afternoon so no, he said he
eh, the manager of his company said he was someone who was not able to, to, skip work, no?
ah, I see, I guess that he asked him for a letter
Exactly.
to be sent to the jury, so that, he
Well yes, yes, yes. But I don't know, I mean, sometimes I think it would be fine to attend, mostly in cases such as
rapes of boys and girls
Mhm.
yes, you can serve as a jury, and, and, and yes, how's that? If you can tell the person is, or if the person is guilty and
you can help so that justice is served quickly, so I think it will be good to serve on a jury.
So, that yes, but well, I wouldn't want to be on one
Ah.
because, I cry a lot, and
today, I cried.
no, it's because if something happens or is about the rape of a child, or if they play a video, it's something, oh
Oh, I see, I see, you wouldn't be able to stand it, I mean, if it's really horrible stuff
Oh, no, that's so terrible, yes
that you, ah, where were you  sent, the, in which state?
Ah, no, I live in Canada
Oh, you are living in Canada, oh.
yes, aha, and you?
I'm here in New York
Oh, aha.
yes but, Ah, I was trying to tell you about a friend of mine, he's in Arizona because I used to live in Arizona and
I see. Mhm, oh.
and then, or hey, do they have the same system in Canada,
Kind of, I believe, I don't know.
Oh, you see, mm, oh, that's good, that's good, well
Yea. Aja.
I don't know, how to tell you this if the day is mine, well eh, yes, yes, outside, but, but how you say, we have to be careful. no?
Yea, we have to be careful, yea, de-, depends but they don't tell you of what, of what type of case, until you have arrived, perhaps, to where the judge, or, or to the
Oh, or so you, no, eh
or where it has to be
to the, but I, I imagine that it should be a meeting or a section to say, explain the case
it is when everything is, is you said yes, that you will do it,
you are already involved, you already decided, this
there, jury duty
oh, there, there, there, there
there, and yes you said no, then I don't want to do it then, ah, too late
No too late
there they said yes there
How, when was it your name, right?
Besy. Besy, there
Petty Oh, Sessy or Jessy?
No, Besy, con ~B
Oh, Besy, oh.
There. Aja. And yours, Javier?
Javier, yes, yes yes,
Now, the mine is easy.
Oh, ¿are you living in Canadá, the how long?
15 years.
¿15 years? Wow.
Yes, yes.
¿How can you resist the cold?
Ah, well, this, I live in a town before, that the winter was really cold and had enough snow.
I see.
fell enough snow
yes.
and then, my husband and I decide moving to, to the beach
I see.
in another province.
Oh.
and then here, here the winter is like rain
Oh
and doesn't get cold.
Oh, I see, and in, in what state, that ¿provinces or states?
Ajá. Is, is a province, is British Columbia is around, eh, when I live is around to Vancouver I don't know if you are going to the city, ajá-
Oh, Vancouver, I see ¿is not around of Washington State?
Already, already, more or less already, already, aja, already
Already, yes, no. Oh, yes. Know that I had plans to go to Vancouver, because ther were some friends from Bolivia.
Oh, aha.
But I lost the trail with them and I couldn't go, because they say to me that the life of there is very calm, I am not sure if this is true.
Oh, now this, a person with whom I spoke before told me you will live in a paradise, and I say: why?
Because there are several islands all around and the Mar is very near and one can go to the United States.
Oh.
do you have a passport
Yes
You can go alone, crossing the border.
Ah
From here the border is about 10 minutes.
Yes, ah.
Yes, Washington, already.
Oh, Were are you origininally from?
El Salvador
oh, yes, I see. I am from Ecuador.
Ah
Yes, because you have a bit an accent as El Salvador.  and even some day I'll see if i can go there, because i tell you here.
Already
here much like, like the justice theme, no here sometimes like, no, no things aren't good
Ya and hay
and and his, and his, how?
Ah, eh, I'm sorry
yes, tell me
No, there is, how do you say? That, let's say, you kill someone and they give you the death penalty.
Aha.
Eh, is there, is there in some state from there, that?
what here in the United States?
the death penalty, ya
Ofcourse, yes, yes they give you the chamber penalty of gas you know
Ya. But I, I was seeing something in the, in the news the other day, that this woman killed her three children.
ya.
she put them in the water and the children drowned.
Oh ya yes yes yes yes
and so my mother says, no, they should kill her, drown her and I say better they put her in jail because she'll suffer more
the other people in jail know what she did and for that
Ya
o, I say that they're going to, eh, piece I say
Ofcourse, the the the mistreatmentor the bad step but imagine that okay, a serial killer that killed someone and
And then? The gas chamber? They have to be punished, yes or no? A few years
And, of course, something that will not cause suffering, because if you kill one and
Yeah, right um yes.
they suffered, mm what, ten minutes or whatever it was but, but, if they put him in jail the other prisoners... ah
mhm
poor thing
Yes, well, no...
That yes, that people suffer I am saying.
Clearly, you can deduce that.
Mhm, there you go, he's going to pay for what he did, and
What he did. I don't know why. Why oh why do the people that do that not
Yes
Yeah, but then as I say not
What do you think. People are crazy
The people are crazy.
Mhm.
and as I say here it's getting hard each time you listen to the comments that, that Canada had were more calm.
Now, there something more calm, yeah.
Yes
Because I imagine that the health care of the United States is not, not as good, or or like like um what do you call it?
What do you call that, that mm, a, a card that they give you for health care? I don't know what it's called
Oh, the, I don't know here, Medicare or something like that.
Yeah, I, Medicare okay, that's it
Yeah.
No, it's not so great.
Yeah, exactly.
Or, or is it?
And over there?
Ah, here it's, I would say that it's good, because
Just that it's more fair
it's fairer, yeah, here it's more fair that
Today, that's great.
then over there
Hey, and, and what is the job market like here?
ya ah, well they are looking for a lot of people to work construction
What kind of, any sort of? Eh, construction.
sure, eh, I think it's for constructing buildings or something like that.
Yeah.
yeah, and they asked in other states.
Oh.
already, but if you have experience doing so build buildings or houses or something.
yes , yes
guess we can ask or visa, or something, I do not know
oh, not because
aha
because I was hearing that if, that, that, that this country, that Canada needs a lot of people, no?
at least in the province where I estou I, uh, um, heard on the news yesterday that they were, they needed people to
for this to work on construction
oh, yes, there, there is a program, on the internet that if you accumulate points, as seventy-four points, and one would
can go to work and the government helps all
to where? here?
yes
oh, Dever? Oh, that I did not know
yes is
mmm
yes, is that you can
mmm
I'm half interested in doing that, right?
yeah
would be good
Okay
And have you ever had any problems with having to go to court or that?
Me? No.
yes.
Hello?  Hello?  G Hello?  Hello?
Hello? Sorry
Hello, yes.  No, it's fine, uh, what is your name, where are you from?
John, eh, from New york
OK, my name is Jennifer, from New York
And you? OH
OK, So we are going to start this thing, finish quickly.
Yes, what was, um the topic?  Did you hear it?
OK, so uh the subject was uh uh, the, interracial marriage
Oh OK  Because I didn't hear it well, mine.
Oh, yeah that was, that was today's subject So, what do you think about interracial marriage?
To me, I don't care.  After that, you are in love with someone,
Hm mm
yes, marry whoever you want
OK, well I
No im- I don't think I care.  Nobody should care either
Yes I, also they ask what, what we thought about Uh if it is easier for certain races to get married like whites and the Chinese.
Not I
uh, blacks and hispanics, things like that, they wanted to know
I don't think that it is easier, but it is more no no better, because, like a Latin person with a Latina, well yes now it depends where you live, where you live, if you get married, if I am a Latino and I marry a black girl or something,
Hmm
in lots of places, probably lots of people will criticize
Oy, yes they always criticize, They do it if you get married
We are, yes
yes, yes you are, if you marry a Spanish girl
Yes, but all the races, what race you are ?
i, i am uh, my father is Dominican
Aha, mother ?
Uhm, both of them
Both Dominican fathers. Good, I'm Puerto Rican
Yes, ah good, my husband is Puerto Rican too
Yes
Then ah, that was a problem too
With his
With his family, obviously, they don't like Dominican people too much
Yes
Yes however, when you look around, the race doesn't count too much because my husband says that too. If we got into details
of every family, it could be a family situation
Yes
in my family there are a lot of professionals, we're a lot more educated, uh
yes
unlucky, in some economical things we are more stable, economically, However
Yes, I
The only reason they had to not like me, was that the last girlfriend, years before meeting me, was Puerto Rican
and I'm from Dominican Partents, born here, raised here
Yes, I have some Dominican family
Yes
I have many cousins married to Dominicans
G
and, well, they have dump they
Yes
Divorced and else
Yes
And they have always been raised, they are my family, I have a lot of Dominican friends
Yes, I can't understand the ignorance
I have a family also. My cousins have married to brown guys
Yes, my sister in law is Afro American ,she, you know
Yes, where from New York are you?
how?
Where from New York?
Uh, eh, Manhattan
Oh, I'm in the Bronx
Ohm OK so yeah, that is theme for me no eh, i get it, a vi- she was born here, In, in New York. Um
Yeah, that's what i think too, i think
I get it and for me it's no so big. Always when both are happy,
Yeah
ah, no, i care less they are green or yellow, uh pst
Yeah, i, me too, i went out with mu- mo- girls of different tyoes
Hmm
They're, um don't know, i don't care. My first girlfriend was Dominican
Oh ok, ok, and, then, the funny thing is we're not all equal
Yes
Because a have some family members of my own, that i don't get along very well
Yeah, same as, as me, i have some friends ad they are Dominican
and i, i don't like them
but they say the are Dominican, they don't tell that around that they are Dominican, because they treat them bad
Yeah
Because that, they are bit rude and all, an he says, i have, and they don't, because their family say that too
Hmm
how, how they call them sometimes, rude, and all that stuff and the are
Sí, hm mm
they are quite, um, nasty
Yes but
They themselves feel ashamed to see, and I said that that does not need to make them feel ashamed because it is there in all races
But eh, exactly it, negate, I love telling people, I tell them  in my professional life, I talk with all kinds of people. And what I say is
I talk, where are you from?, I am Dominican.
Yea, I know one guy, OK
What? where from? how can that be, I believe it was you, what does that have to do with.
No I know a guy who is a policeman, I am a policeman, right?
Hm mm
And me, he always, he has tattos um, with the Puerto Rico flag
Aham
And I always thought he was Puerto Rican, until two or three weeks ago, when we made a, um a barbeque for, no, more than three weeks, to say summer goodbye.
Aham
He was talking there, and the wife was talking there, and something about him making a vow to the flag came up. And I didn't know that, and they said that he made the vows to the flag that he was not Dominican and all that and he made
Eh
such um, like when he made himself a citizen here
Hm mm
And he always said that he was Puerto Rican and all, and changed his documents to tell that he is Puerto Rican
Pe- pst but this is
Well he was not born here, but he changed everything that the parents and all, all that.
He is your friend, but that is ignorance, because
Yeah, I said, but why did you do it, then he said, because those people have not, they don't talk to me.  He doesn't
you know
He doesn't want to know anything Dominica, I say, but I, that is not like that because right now, there are Puerto Ricans who don't want to know anything from Puerto Ricans but
Yes
for their life they say, oh, I am Puerto Rican.
It is that, no
They never- they never change.  I don't know why you should change it.
Exactly
And he well no, I am I am an American, Puerto Rican American, and with that he doesn't
That is he doesn't have, that is, I'm sorry that is ignorance.
Ah I, I being Dominican, hey I am Dominican, because I cannot change it.
Yea, that eh
Not like him, who has been paying and paying, to change everything, so he says he is Puerto Ri- and do, and and from New, New York
And still you, you being you know that they have nothing to do with that.
Hm mm
That, that doesn't change at all because still.
yeah where, where, where I am working now,
Aha
here in the Bronx there are many Dominicans.  There, there's, there are lots of Puerto Ricans, but there are Dominicans too.
Mm-hm
Lots of people say, "Oh, the Dominicans are gross, they don't know how to do anything, there's a lot of, there's a lot of Dominicans.
There's all classes, in all the, the races.
You could say, there are more Dominicans than whites.
And now because of this you have Dominicans, that love to multiply.
Yes
have kids.
Yeah, no, and then the, the Puerto Ricans don't say anything.  Because the more come in, like they say, the more Hispanics come, more Latinos, the better.
Yeah
The little whites are the ones that have a lot of Dominican, and this one, and this one and this one.
Yeah
This one Puerto Ricans want to grab oh, all this here
Uh, but, you know, this
So.
Uh, Yeah, I feel like speaking English, uh, I can't, we can't
I know, well, I'm getting up there too
But everything--this is because the brother, is a policeman here, in Manhattan
Yeah, yeah
In my thirties, and, already, a house Um, and he, uh and I work with, uh, in inves-, Uh, like investigation, but I work mostly with policemen.
Yea
So in that
Yes
just a moment. Eh so, i always say, always, oh, where are you from?. Then they talk to me for a while, after i helped them, Dominican people say things in front of me
they said oh yes, then blah blah blah, they tell me, oh where are you from?, uh, Dominican
Yes, yo-ha-yo, i speak like Dominican like that
Eh, oh
but in front of them, and the Puerto Rican
yes no
talking is one thing, talking, but there are some who speak of them, and they fall there, until they get the point
oh yes, no
because, sometimes, we are talking in a group, look he is a dominican, so dirty, this and that, but i am talking with the group
OK ok
two or three dominicans, with two or three Puerto Ricans
OK
with whities, we chat like this
yes because
But
the difference is that you can criticize a person and describe it like that Dominican in that corner
yeah, because when i watch people on the street, that i know they are Dominicans because they have a flag or something
Ok, but yea,
I am Dominican, I came
Yea, exactly, yes
this way yes
You know them because, unfortunately, the, the worse Dominicans, the ones that do all the things, are always painted, they have tattoos
yes, like the
they have a shirt, they are
yes, like women also.
yes
That from a distance for a reason.
oh yeah, eh, yeah, yeah, that also, but we are not all like that. Is that, that is funny thing, because when I was in college that was, oh, where are you from?
New York, oh, oh, what, what, how, what what ethnicity are you, oh, I'm Dominican, oh no.
yes, yeah
I don't think so
Yeah, yeah, turn around
yeah. Oh, no, that one, that one in unfortunately that's a, a trait we all have. But, still, its the point of
Excuse me, The Point that um because we are or that we have that attribute.
Yeah,
No, no I don't mean that we are all the same.
yea
Because i have cousins that make me ashamed, because they're sluts, basically
Yeah oh no, no, I didn't mean it that way, I meant it with the back part
And no,but no, I understand but, you know, let's you go,to, to the heart of it
yeah
Eh, they are like that, and have persons too
Yeah
you know, we are professionals and we do what we do, and pitifully ok, my grandmother had a nice bottom, and we all inherited
Right yeah, but you know, it's like that always, it's like
But
so what, if they are you know what, sluts, like you said
No
Puertorican,
Eh we all have one
Dominicans, hell yeah
yeah, so it's like, but, i don't that such a simple thing like you know you are Puertorican, i am Dominican,
Like, look at me, my family, with their own cousins, and everything
No no no, oknow, but
I know that for a fact
Yeah, but what kill me is that we're so close in proximity,
Yeah
Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are what, like niety miles apart? We're closer than Florida and Cuba.
Yea
And we hate each other just because of where we were born, what is that?
yea it's not even, it's because like some, like the Dominicans say, oh, Dominicans think they're better than us, and Puerto Ricans think they're better than us, like that.
Exactly, yea, but I, you know
And that's all starts, like even in chatrooms, in the computer checking out the chatrooms,
Hm mm
and that's just like crazy, the way that we're fighting.
It just, it makes me laugh, I usually don't tell people until I'm asked, but, I never deny my race. Like people say something, and I'll stand and be like, oh, hold up.
Yea well, the reason why I part asked you why you're from New York, 'cause
Hm mm
like what part of New York, 'cause you sound like like white
Get out of here
Yeah, you sound like white.
Oh thank you so much, I speak Spanish like a white person too?
But nothing, nothing of course, not now, let the Spanish come out.
Oh L- let me find out ok. That's another eh, that's another thing that bothers me. Just because a person is, um, You what, what does it mean to some white
Yeah, like
You know what I'm saying, what.
Like me when I told you I'm from the Bronx, I thought that they were going to hang up, because I had three callers, I told them I'm from the Bronx, and they hung up.
Hm mm
they hang up on me
No, abs-please, I'll tell everybody I don't care.
In, in Florida DisneyWorld,
Hm mm
It was a line and we were standing a few excuse me, 'cause you had, the line was moving but they weren't moving.
I see
and I had, I said Bronx New York, and they Oh, honey, come on, they're from the Bronx, and they moved, and they got off the line like
out embarrassed
No, it's no, it's not your fault it's not
I was like, oh oh well
your fault is not to, is you know, people act ignorant around me all the time, and say stupid things like that,, and it's like
Yeah
Hi?
yes. Hello?
Hi, good night
Good night, How are you?
Fine. Who I'm talking to?
David
Oh, David. It's Joe, or Jo- José
yes, How are you?
Oh, fine, fine. And where do you live?
Here at Connecticut, i think i already talk with you like a week ago
O- Oh, yes, yes, yes. How are you?
yes, it was cut off, it was cut off the call, No?
yes, i don't know why
Eh,i don't know why it was cut off
Oh, yes, i don't know what they are going to do with that, because they have
Howdy, How are you?
so much calls that, that, had been cut off. And, it seems that also
yes
there is a lot of people that, i don't know, is that, there is so many calls that they haven't processed. Therefore, it seems to me that they don't know how many valid calls
have every person. Therefore, i don't know what they are going to do. Because, already, already are a to much people that, by example, my mother alredy have reach the twenty five calls
Ah, yea?
But, she knows that there were several calls that didn't cut out. So, she doesn't know what to do, right?
Oh, but they still call you, or no?
yes, they still call her. I don't know, a, two weeks ago, yesterday they were calling here. But, I think they still are, I don't know. But,
Ah, well, they just, they pay her just for twenty five, right?
I think so. I think so. But, and, uh, yes, it's just that, in the end, the thing is that, it doesn't seem very well organized to me, and it surprises me because
they've done that lots of times, the, the, the LDC, because they did it two years ago, or a year and a half
yes, to do it in English. Right?
But, before, yes, it was, uh, well, it was in English, but they also had it in Arabic, and and Spanish, and whatever. But, yes, yes, e- that's already an old story. They've already done it lots of times, so, I don't know, or least once.
Ah.
And, that time, well, for several months. So, I don't know now because all of a sudden it's new again, ah.
Ah, yea. Um, really, I don't know, I mean, yea
No,
it's, it's, it's pretty clear, because, the other time, uh, yes, uh, they had the, the topic, it was about m- about religion,
and they were like for fifteen or twenty days it was all, all, the same top-, ah, the same topic.
Ah, I know. No, no, no. And, and not just that the, the recorder that was, I think, some, some type of computer, or something they had there, uh.
Ah yea.
And, that, that, that, that they tell her-, I, that, that's my theory, that what they were saying was what they t- t- e- they write the text in English, for what they wanted the, the, for her to say
that, that, that you could hear it, right?
Ah.
Then, they went to the auto-this, translator, then, they put the text there.
Aha.
from English to Spanis, and then, there, of, of that they occupied a computer that, that, that made, I don't know, that, t-t-then, there are computers, or there are programs that do not
put, put a lot of text, then the computer, the computer reads it.
Right,
yes, yes. No, no, well, well, the translator, it was something like this, type, I imagine.
Aha.
Then, what it talked about,
Ah.
I imagine that it was a, it was a computer.
of course, of course, of course. Mhm.
then, it didn't, it didn't, it didn't only have a bad accent, but everything that it said it was, for example, when the calls ended, it said,
your time is above.
Yeah, no, I never saw it often, because when
yes, no, no, no, I didn't. I didn't either, well, I, I, I never checked until, until various times. Right? that I heard it, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't understand anything. Right?
yes.
and, then, one time, there, I heard, ah, yes, your time is above. Or, for example, one time, What was it? it had, the, the topic was "dating,"
then,
Mhm.
the, the translation in Spanish was to date. The it, that way, How do you like to date it? Things like that, that are
Yeah
Incredible. But, obviously they have people who speak Spanish, right? I don´t know.
yeah, but it depends
it has not be well, very, very, very well organized,
Not, because they are always stressing the system, because if you send them an email, they answer you, the next day, very fast.
Hmm. Hm, Shudong, yes. But, the good thing is that they pay well, at last.One is Is a little bothering, having to answer and,
but, not, is not big deal, there. And they pay well.
yeah, but, ah, with, with me. I, I, the other time I did it and it was over
Hmm
And I don´t know what happened, they didn´t call me again, and didn´t have a phone number to call them or something like that, but they sent me a check
Hmm.
You know, about sixty days ago, maybe two months ago, and they sent me a check.
Mm. Hmm
Until I forgot it. I never knew.
Ah, a surprise,
yeah, That´s, that´s true And do you live in Philadelphia, right?
yes, in Philadelphia , yes, yes, my mom lives in the outskirts , I live here, eh in, in West Philly, in
Okay.
at the University. Then,
Oh, because you live in the outskirts too. Don´t you?
that, that here cer-Mm?
in school? You guys go to Penn State you said. No?
No, No, University of Pennsylvania yes, no, no, yes it's different yes, that all the world is confused by that because eh because Penn State
Is located in the center of the state
Yeah yes
and it is a public University
Right
and so am and so the university where I am it's the University of Pennsylvania.
Ah in two diffferent, so
yes exactly, that is private, and is located in the city it is completely different. The other its much bigger and is public it is the countryside
Yes those that are and another thing like that. No?
Ah.
Where the wilds are. No?
I don't know. Eh, then I have never gone there, I, I, don't know exactly where it is.
Over there. Oh.
But what what that it is in the center. Well, maybe in the eighty one maybe, possibly, but but although the eighty one I think will be more
no. Possibly, yes, possibly yes because I know that the eighty one well I don't know, better, better I say nothing. i
For mine it is the same
Yes mi e e e yes, yes all that I know of the eighty one is that, because we used to live in Tennessee
and northeast
Ha. alright
so, close to virginia, we were living in virginia, but then we moved to Tennessee, but then we found out that the eighty-one passed through there, but that's all i know.
Oh, Okay
It seems like its long highway, i don't know, but, yeah so you, but, are you finished, or are you still studying, what are you doing?
Oh, no, I don't work, I wish i could work, I wish i could also go to school.
MM, oh, okay.
But im,
Its a lot easier imagine.
Yeah, some people don't think about it, but when you're at school, that's were you find friendship, you dont have to go out, to you know, talk to your friends.
Not, the whole world relies in the center, in the same center, you know.
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
but, then one is done, and has to go home, and has to pay the, the costs of the house, its really hard, its better to stay at school.
Yeah, that's good, though. the good thing about being in university, is that when someone is done, ones costs rise.
a lot, right? so, one has to buy a car, and you want one, then another. so then one would have to start working. right? so that you could maintain yourself, while a student just lives there.
yeah, you need to have an effort. yeah
a little, just a bit, i don't know, have you heard about ramon soups?
No, no, no.
no, no, no, those soups that they sell, raman soup, costs like twenty cents.
Oh yeah, yeah
if one could live off of ramon soups, it would only cost you twenty five cents to eat dinner, but then again, it isn't that way.
yeah. yeah, yeah
you don't spend much less, but it's a life more calm, yes its calm, but i think too that when the people remember when they were students, forget everything else so in the workplace really?
yes, sure
yes, but its a life that has more freedom, flexibility in time like by example, if i want spend tonight
everynight awake,then i don't know, studying and i dont have class tomorrow i dont care really? because i dont have, or someday i dont want to go to class really
ehh yes
but in the work you cant say, oh yeah i didn't want to go to work today
yes, well it doesn't happens
only that yes, no no its very flexible
no no, your skills
mmm
in life, when you go out to school everybody calm down, you know, they have family, or married
you know, they have children, and the life is more harder no?
a lot harder
yes, so if you want to live the life like the Americans i am going to tell you, you know the American dream
The American dream, you know, they want to buy a house, this and other
yeah, yeah , yeah the trouble is that i feel its that you have to be happy with what you have a that it seems what
a lot people not do, because the income rise obviously the work, responsibilities you have
But at the same time
right
everything that one consumes, is one, one goes to buy for a better car, and one may do one thing and the other. And then when one sees, the money is gone, right? And one stays there, it looks to me only with the responsibilities. Right?
Yeah
So, I don't know. Right now I am happy as a student, but for now. Right? But eventually, of course, one has to save to buy a house. But,
I don't know, that is scary to me, having so many overheads. Right? Because, it's that one works, works, and works.
Yeah
And one feels that, one is not enjoying money. Right? But also that, in part, is because one says, well, one doesn't think of all the benefits that it gives to one person. Right? But, also
one has a car to go to work. Right? so, one has to have this, so that one has to cut the grass. I don't know, it seems a lot to me.
Right Yeah
A lot, so, fixed payments, fixed responsibilities. Is, I don't know.
Yeah you are more, more responsibilities in life.
yes, definitely.
But, you know, but, and, in life of being poor, it is more difficult.
yes, right
The life of being poor, has nothing to do nothing, you know. If you want o work, you work, if you don't want to work, you maintain it
yes, yes, that is right.
you know
The wife maintains him.
Yeah, more or less, same thing , you know.
yes
for, eh you have to get one, one good woman, that could help you, who has, who has a house, or an apartment, who helps you, for this and that. But,
yes, yes.
No, but life is like this, well, No?  You know
yes
Live and learn
yes, no, well, n- eh, I think so, that there is, that there is, it is because of that, that one has to have, like that, I think, be careful with, with
how you spend money.  Because it is very easy.  Because,  for example, yes if you buy a house, then, buy another, and boy another, I, people don't understand anything, and you feel that you don't, are not going to enjoy money.  Right?
You have to be serious to see
Right
what is more important.  Right? What, what, what is it that you like to do.
right No, but e-
And if not, if it is not that.  Then, it is better not to spend money on that.  Right?
You tell me, the, the large companies, they are- they are giving you stuff.
That is what it seems to me.
Don't you see that, that, big companies they, they give you cars, no money down? They give you the, the stuff,
