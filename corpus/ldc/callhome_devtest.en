Uh, ¿what size are the little ones?, i want to send you some sweaters for the winter

the, the ro-, Veronica, how old is she already?
Veronica is nine months old
not nine, almost one year, it must be almost one year

four, she will be four, see?
when?
in September, mom
Oh, see, then four years old, I will send you some sweaters for the kids, with 'Mechita'
I see
I see
mm, but, but
sure, listen
the problem is the size, what size will you send? right?
I will send a four or , five, I will send a five, right? because if she is already four we have to make one more size
it is for the winter, it would be better to take the measures, wouldn't it?
but how? you would have to call me by phone with the measures
of course
it is better if I send you an extra size, one year for Veronica and five years for the other
well
okay, okay, okay honey

thank you very much for this conversation
listen listen but not yet, we still have five minutes.
Here is Mechita who wants to talk, Mechita! you still have time

Happily, no. Ah, how nice.
Happily no, up to now everything is calm. Yes.
How nice. It already passed. How nice.
Ah, it already passed. Yes. Yesterday Smith saw her.
What joy. Listen what joy it gives me that you call me, because I was
Yes.

Yes, well.
I couldn't call you, you know that here the company is so expensive
Yes, it's a tranca? and a half, right?
Yes. I don't, ah, no
Tranca and a half. Yesterday Smith saw Veronica
And? yes.
He tells me that she's fine, but
Ah.
Veronica is different from Rocio, because Veronica is smaller than Rocio
Okay
Rocio looks bigger, she  was bigger as a baby, Rocio, Veroniquita looks smaller, thinner,right?
Okay, well, all the kids are not the same.
But what the doctor... that's what my doctor said, look, they do have personalities... they're different
Sure, and that's how it is, that's how it is
And well, this one is shorter, he said, because i was worried, ¿right?, but well
Right, that's not, that's not, later on you
Yeah, the doctor said that you can't know until two years, he said
[Just] When i thought that Milagrito (little miracle) was going to be taller than everyone
Yeah, well
And you've seen it, you were the shortes
That's what the doctor said. Yeah, well
And you were the shortest, ¿do you remember?
But happily, she's eating well
Oh, not that, oh Regio
And she crawls all over the house, oh yeah
And she's very knowledgeable, she's very happy, she understands everything
Yeah, she crawls around--
She's developing normally, that's what matters most.
Would you believe me that, Rocío, Rocío has an alphabet we made, there in the kitchen's closet, ¿right?
¿What Regio?, right, right
And then, Rocío used to say "well, she knows them even on her sleep", so now we're doing syllables
Very good
but there has stayed the alphabet
Mm, yes, yes
and Veronica comes, she sits and says, and points at the letters, and says, ah, ah, ah.
She also has a teacher.
Her too, listen. Yes.
She has her teachers. How cute, how cute. Listen, did Miguel call you?
Yes, yes, Miguel called me early, and Milagros called me early.

Yes.
I say, I tell Rocio, she's coming to the house
Yes.

We will probably go around the middle of January, no? I mean, yes, yes.

Milagros has to travel during the first days of January.
First days of January. Mmm. Yes, okay, because she has to go back to work, no?
Yes, yes. Yes!

I see. Yes, oh no, it has to have a rope.
Mmm, yes.
Yes, no, I can buy it here. We have lots of beautiful ones here too, Marita, okay?
Mmm, here, for example, the stores in here, they are bigger because they baptize the kids when they are older.
Yes. And they are, yes, I see
or a girl a two year old girl, it seems absurd to me, that, I don't think it's
Let me tell you, no no no.
no, I  don't think it's right.
No, those ropes and the caps and everything, I can buy them here Marita, but you must tell me if you are not buying it there so that I can buy it here.
Sure.
Do you understand?
I'm still going to Sacramento, I mean, if they don't have the caps, I'm not interested.
It's not worth it, because there are some very nice sets here, okay?
I see. Here, it's not, I don't know, for example, I sincerely tell you that I'm happy because I made them, the ones I did.
Yes. Oh, they were beautiful.
Like mine I haven't seen. No, I haven't seen.
No, no, no, beautiful. And that's how Mariela wants it.
Aha.

I have seen them here in satin, but a more or less hard satin, Mmm.
There are fiv- Oh, no. No, no. So look Marita, don't complicate your life, I will buy it here, do you understand?
Good, like, let me see one time, in the city of Sacramento, to see what they have brought new. Let me see one more time.

Oh, I believe it's because of the cold, mmm
mmm
that's nonsense, I had the idea of carrying some bricks.

I've been doing really bad, for a month, I've been, but today, I felt better.
but you have to take a look at the calendar mo, when you do those things, sure
yes, yes, everybody says that but I do feel fine, well, but I'm doing better now.
Yes, well, yes but you can't you can't abuse your health mom, mom
it's not that, I can't stay here doing nothing Coqui, if you don't do anything you get old, your knees become stiff and your joints too, that's what happens, I'm better now.
no, yes, but, but you can do things but without that much effort, mom, you can do them without hurting yourself, what do I know, take a walk but being careful of your own body.
yes, I go out everyday, everyday and on Monday, I'll begin with gym classes.
that's great
yes because, I did some gym last year and then I felt really great during the winter, so, I'm starting again next Monday
no problem, that's what you have to do, gym, don't stop, don't stop practicing it mom
mmm sure, we have graduate teachers, she's saying, she tells you what you can and can't do, I mean, I
mmm
the teacher, oh, I can't do this exercise because I have a back problem, mmm
oh sure.
so, we are under control
I see
so now, here there are some friends of Paty that were in the course and she tells me that why don't I go, so Monday I'm going to go
well I think it's good, I think it's good
mm, yes and, what is it called, the truth that like I need it, see
sure, yes
because I feel suddenly like my legs are, yes like I have the whole body like rigid
sure you need to, a little to keep the body always moving, so mommy.
Mm, tell me child, how are the kids?
now it's just, tell me, how are the kids
Karinita is there next to you, listen
sure Karina is here next to me drinking a juice in a, a
she starts drinking, mm
Sure, yes, yes that picture, look, it was by luck, we were watching a foot- game of Brazil
yes
and it won I remember Brazil was, and the guy from
mm
a newspaper from here, from, from, went there where we were watching the game and took our picture
mm
so he asked me if he could, I told him that yes
yes okay
so the day, the following Sunday we bought the newspaper and I came out there really big as Brazilian
I was telling Cuqui here that it must have gotten, bought every newspaper to send to the whole family
No, i have, mommy, i have your copy here, the thing is
Send it to me, honey
out of laziness, look, i haven't sent it to you out of laziness, I've also got a postcard that i want to send to you, it's here, out of laziness, where we speak on the phone
Right, hey me too, when you call me, i have nothing to tell you, uh huh
Sure, no, yeah, look, it's alright, as long as we're communicated, whether it's by phone, there's no, no
right
you don't need to write to me, what's what happens with me, since i speak with you on the phone
Yeah, of course
uh, then later on i don't have anything to tell you, huh
Coqui, before i forget, i paid for your college
Yeah
it wasn't paid on ninety four, so what i paid was ninety four
Oh, right
The paper, the paper i had was an assessment of what they had done to me
Oh, right, right
Uh huh, i said, "i payed you for ninety four"
OK
uh huh, it was fifty four thousand and something
Ok, mommy, ¿did you have enough?
Yes, yes, because, with dollars it was fifty eight
Oh, right, right, right
Fifty, fifty, fifty eight rounding up
right
uh, it was almost fifty eight, so i got
a tip
an excellent tip for, for locomotion
locomotion, sure, locomotion and the respective eleven
for locomotion, ¿right?, no, because it would have had to be, a coffee, it was a coffee
one coffee
one coffee, because in the morning, they only serve until two in the Comptroller
Oh, right
uh huh
hey
but
tell me
i was very pleased when i did that errand for you, like, i was so peacefully
right
So, you might still get the paper suddenly, when you write to Christian, the truth is i don't need, i didn't remember much about Christian
Mommy, mommy, about the, mommy, about the letters, uh, we're gonna be in this address until September fifteen only
hmm, hmm, yes ] yeah
and from there the direction won't be worth more, because from there, in front, I don't know what specific day we'll change states.
yeah, hey, Cuqui, how long are you going to be there, where are you going to go?
ah well, I'm going to the laboratory for six months and
yes
well I'll, I'm not going with a set end date, it all depends on me, if I'll stay forever or
yeah
ah go
you'll go with everyone?
huh?
for six months you'll go with everyone?
I'll go with everyone, sure, I'll bring the whole family, of course, of course
the whole family?  yeah for six months and there you don't know if you, eh?
sure we'll go ] huh?
you don't know if you'll stay there?
well, so, it's just what I'm talking about, it depends on me, that's it
yeah
so if I produce well in the laboratory, the possibility that I'll say is big, if it goes badly, the probability that I'll return is good too --
yeah, and now you'll go back, God willing, where will you go too?
no, look, I could go back to Brazil, or even Chile, I don't know how this could be
and what a pi- what a pity it would be, because here there's the
ah, but I don't have the
here the thing is really stripped down
yes, and I'm not interested
hmm, because here everything's gone down and what happens is that the salaries go down, the pensions are less
well, like I told you, this will depend on me, on my performance in the laboratory, in fact, and there are people interested in my knowledge
sure
yes, I'm performing well, the guy told me, and if I keep performing well, they will, they will prolong my stay for longer --
hmm ah, yeah
so it depends on me, now it totally depends on me
but is the University of Brazil involved in it?
no, no, only here in the United States, sure
your ]
it was when I was in the congress, I met a professor there, ah, a scientist in the laboratory
like who's
we were talking and he was interested
yeah, and he took you?
he took me
to Tennessee?
to Tennessee
To Tennessee?
to Tennessee
to Tennessee, I see, to the University of Oakland, to Oakland.

Knoxville
to Knoxville, Knoxville
to Knox, oh what, Coqui, is so hard, Knoxville?
Sure, KNOXVILLE, Knoxville, Knoxville, it's not, that's where we are going to live next.
Knoxville, Knoxville, okay, okay, that has nothing to do with Brazil.
no, nothing to do
nothing to do, oh
mom
I see, I mean, it would be a huge step for you
yes mom, a step, some people are envy of that because it's a really important laboratory in the American scientific field
I see, oh Coqui, may God make it all good for you, well, that depends on you, only you my son.
I know mom, it all depends on me, mom, could we say goodbye for now, I would like to speak to Paluteca

today they confirmed it and, a month from now I'll go to Knoxville, to the- with the whole family to work in the Oak Ridge laboratory.
yes, and look, that's great, it worked out for you, then
it worked out for me
how fantastic, you have to look for an apartment and everything, hmm
sure, sure, from here in a month I'll go with Aminta, with beds and bags there to get an apartment and to work.
yeah, Knoxville in Tennessee, huh?  yeah
in Tennessee, the border with the state of North Carolina
hmm, that's great, in a month, like it would be the end of September
no, I think that for the eighteenth of September, we'll go there
hmm yeah, that's great!  Like you have to start to save things, huh?
we'll go to these places ] sure, yes, we're looking in, I'm thinking about getting a truck, to look for a little truck
yeah
to but things inside and to go with everything
aye, that's great, that's wonderful!  Great
to see, huh?
that's great, it turned out so well for you, I'm really happy, well, it's calm, and how long will you be there?
well in theory six months, if I stay there it will depend directly on me, now
yeah sure, for all the work you put into it
sure on all my knowledge and my gruesomeness that I can do there
and look, that's great, wonderful, well, stupendous, I'm really happy, that's great
after yeah, aha
what do you want me to say, it's fantastic to me, and how great that you can get to know another city, and other people and other things
sure and it's a pretty important step, believe me that this is how I'm playing it.
no, you told me, first I'll send you, I, I'll send you you told me
Okay
you never sent it
I sent it to you, but I already sent it to you , but I, I sent it to you but what I wanted to know, was if, if we had, if we were in Vina or, We were like that no
how we were? no, what it is, but here they arrive fast Jorge
I don't know what happens, here they take a long time, it's like the, the, the is
And when did the ones from yesterday arrive?
just today in the morning, you want me to tell you the time?
No, you know what must've happened is that yesterday was Sunday, and you work?
No, it's a holiday here
mm, are you home?
I'm working
are you home?
No, here in front of the machine, in the office, I've been hard at it all day, but I left at eleven thirty, later I passed by to pick up Monica and we left, we bought a salad and we went to have lunch to Baxter, next to the pool
And now it's four something and at ten minutes til five, and at four I returned, like that. ah, no.
Mm and how are you, what news are there, tell me a lot
Nothing in reality, what do you want me to tell you
this is a mess, because you see that Benejereve is coming and that he wants with Raquel, obviously he wants to get together, that if not he gets offended, he already sent me a because I wasn't going to pick him up at the airport
yes
terrible, I swear
yes it has come back]
well, I called them Aguirre, right? well I got them to go for it
mmmm
eee after came Grunber and they wanted to have lunch, we had dinner eee with Gille, I stayed as well]
Grunber sent a] Waht?
I also dated Guille, besides right now I feel like more at home when I meet with Guille, and we have more, more things in common because, obviously than with Grumero
too bad that with him you can only fool around. That's it. So this is a mess, right? I don't even know how I will get to the airport on Thursday. Have you seen Claudia? she's absolutely crazy because, look, the passage, I bought her another two return tickets
so I guess we will travel to Mimai, Buenos Aires together, at most
Aaaa, I won't see her
mmm?
I won't see her
why?
She goes home, she doesn't go home, at the end
Yes!
Oh weel th-
But] there are, but Enrique I am talking with the United States, will you behave? -- Hello?
Who is Enrique?
] Eh? Martinenco, you don't know him
Oh, it rings some bell, however
well, and then, mm, what was I saying? if she goes to the States, is it alright?
hmm
I don´t know how much time ago, when I had my reservation, she carefully took notes, flight number, schedules, and seat Do you understand?
hmm hmm
And she gave it to the girl that is in charge of the, of the bank, who knows, what a history for me to buying that.
hmm
did not buy a damn thing, she even put lakes
ah what a luck, fantastic for an international message, what happened to you
ah and the girl told, no, there is not any problem my child, but, you skinny, a jerk catches you
what, what a trick
and he sends you because he eh?
they take years to, to proceed with the fly tickets
I know, and they even shit it with the miles
ah
well, so Mister Intelligence was going to fix it, but the one from the travel I don´t know, so at last, not there but besides it we took a different flight in Austin Dallas, another different in Dallas Miami and in Miami we joined
how good
of course I say we should be more or least
well, that is fine because that way the two of you could not die together in those dates
I think so Oh Jorge that was the fucking thing!
no but did you see it, here
The fucking thing was fun, it was about the two coming together in the planes
exactly, but because here, mm, they have seminaries where they tell you how you have to take care of yout life and your chick
Yes, well. Yes, and you found out how to make it for the Yankee state not to take all of our things, Iche told me you went to that seminary
Iche did go
and?
and you, didn't you go?
no, I was here, darling
you should have gone, they taught me how to be aware of wives who want to take everything of their husbands, who want to keep everything, look
really?
no
Oh yes, what I have seen is that you are not making the proceeding
I don't understand
I mean, without the diploma you can't start the proceeding, can you?
where is it? yes, I know, no, no I can't find it
Did you get that box I told you Jorge?
what box?
under, under the futon
yes, that one
Did you get that one?
no
no, then I want to know, but man, man, really, I don't want to go on like this
okay, yes, we have to talk about, but another time, when you're here because this changed the whole, what's it called, economic situation
For the worse?
eh, it depends, in depends on the objectives like with everything, it depends on what you want to do, where you want to pay your, your, and everything else
I didn't understand, good, well
with a green card, you're a resident yes, or yes, it doesn't matter, you can't not resident, so you have to declare, what you earn in the whole world
okay, but in any case I don't have to start the green card and you will have to waive in any case, so if we want to do this
but anyway, that's life, hmm.  Well.
Ah we'll see, well, eh, tell me something else, how fun, and how is it?  Do they cut you off?
yes, they call you and they tell you that you have another minute, you see, you heard it
so, and then you send the, and did I get something?  someone was looking at my account for me
Monica talked, and I don't know if she's checking it, what you want to do, drain it?
Nothing, but in the notice that they're spelling out, because if you don't make a
Well
they're going to cut me off, for, for the potential growth of the night club
No, I don't think so, in any case, but no, nothing, nothing happens
I asked Victor to do this, he didn't
no, Victor didn't do anything, Victor is the most bourgeois of the bourgeois, he complains about everything, but his amusements are basically totally
Yes yeah
totally, he sails, goes water skiing and others
ah it was, what camp did he go to?
he went to a camping trip with submarine hunt, submarine hunt, no, no, wait, it's not submarine hunt because I don't think they do any hunting but, he went to a camping trip
scuba diving
scuba diving
sweet!
mmm, they don't have a great time but for example, he didn't, he didn't got the license
I can't believe that
I say this when I fight, no, he didn't take the pants that you left for him to fix, to the Mexican, oh no, he didn't cut the grass
lets say, but, he doesn't do anything, he doesn't washes the clothes, Monica, I mean, so lazy.
mmm and how is Monica?
Monica, I think she's fine, really fine, oh, she's a bit blue, she doesn't say anything.
Lola just came over to pick up her letter
Oh
and she told me that they won't go to Canada for now, because they can't get the numbers right or something, what do I know!
well, it's because with this new CONEA situation, they  are not able to move someone from Argentina as of now.
Why not?
because the CONEA is privatizing, if you want to have a
no, I think it's right, if you look closely, this company that old Lolo works for has the worst relations with this government
Oh, oh
so, he can't do anything, that's what I understood about it.
Oh
so, well, that's it, I am absolutely destroyed, I don't even want to know what I have to do, not even what I have to do
I'm going to have black outs, I won't be able to say good morning
And when is it? this afternoon?
No, tomorrow in the afternoon
well, sleep until late, until noon
I can't, because at half past eleven I have to meet with the lawyer
Oh, how comes?
Oh! Bolongui and Fernando didn't even know, it looks like the court seized them for fifty thousand dollars
aha!
the wuotes of the selling of the field, so, they, so that was
Why, because didn't they pay?
eh?
because they hadn't paid?
No. Because he lied
Oh! uh
so it looks like my lawyers did that formality, and that is not warned
mmmm
it is a matter that runs separately, and they are not given hearing until they decide what's going on
oh, I see
so they knew when they asked for the seize of the, of the mortgage, however as it is absolutely false, or something, they appealed , you know what I mean?
so now they are I don't know where
What a dis-!
and so I have to go with him, to complain to the judge and tell her, look how long do you want me tostay acting like a stupid, here
that I understood because ] she wants me to saty acting stupid, what does that mean?
it means that, that, that this started in November ninety-two
mmm
and it has two thousand two hundred, it has five volumes, I don't know but this has to end sometime, they were about to give a sentence, a long time ago, but they don't, so
Oh, those?
to pressure on the appealing chamber, to do whatever it takes
mmm
They take a little bit of everything.
But, they pay taxes and do not pay the household.
yes, yo have to pay taxes, like 15%, yes Mr.
oh, you have to pay 15% of taxes
anyways it is much better to buy the things over there because it is a lot of cheaper.
mmm--
It is very good because it cost one dollar
one dollar per pound
per pound, so with the airlines it is more expensive. You know I take three boxes when I am going to travel
mmm
yes you could take three more boxes but I would not know what to do with it.
well, maybe that is true, but the problem is--
so it would be better to say
It is better to take it and devided in parts, the problem would be to take it all at once.
No my love we have to take it all at once, because nobody is going to stay here, so no one can send the package.
now, if it weights six hundred pounds, it would cost us six hundrend dollars and also add all the taxes we have to pay.
okay
It is very good to take the things because the equipment you have is woth a lot of money there baby.
A TV is worth money, you know.
well, you have to see how much we would pay.
I already made them fat and it comes out much better, it comes out much cheaper anyway
but fifteen percent of what? of the original invoice
of the value of the value of the merchandise I know
original
no they have there, if you have the invoice, well better, but if not they have there a list where it says a Mitsubishi television is worth
one hundred dollars, a sound equipment is worth three hundred dollars, they already have the standardized list from customs
ah well ah they have a well
yes they no of course because they can't put, a color TV from nineteen fifty
sure, sure well perfect
then they they have it standardized by brands
well perfect
eh? anyway is good that you find out in customs because if by any chance they give you a hassle that you have been there more than a month
yes
I also knew of, of a person that did it through the company and the company certified that the person had been by major force
eh the work that it wasn't a pleasure thing they let him enter but this guy
yes
who's Colombian from, from a transport company told me look so- they don't give any problem
from what company is he?
I don't remember, Esther was the one that gave me the phone because I called three
well but and, and you didn't call the one Hofman gave you?
yes I also called but the guy told me that he had to come here to the house to look at things
ahhhh
so I said no, what a shame, but I'll call you, I have to consult with my husband
hmmm
yes I didn't tell him that you were there or anything, or the address or the telephone number or anything
yeah perfect
you see?  There's another guy who's a little cheaper, for six hundred pounds he charges five hundred something, like it comes out to less than a dollar
aha
and, and the goods are insured for nine dollars
aha
yes nine dollars each thing, nine dollars a pound, better said
yes.
So, what more was I going to tell you, eh, Gilberto talked with, with this guy from the
yes, with who?
eh with Jim, they guy who just called me because it seemed that he was free Saturday Sunday and Monday or Sunday Monday and Tuesday he'll call me
aha
to see what we'll do with the car, with the car pads, anyway, so that they put
great, perfect
I don't know where it stayed, or what Gilberto arranged, ] it wasn't Gilberto who talked, I didn't talk with him
] ah, you didn't talk with him, it was Gilberto, great
it was the only thing that Gilberto told me when the guy was going to call me for, for this
good mom.
This is only, my love and fatty's working, and the other is following another job, sweetie, because it takes all kinds
of what?
of whatever, honey, if I go out and do whatever on the weekends
so ] you're going to have three?
well, yes, fatty, because what can we do
no --
you have to, sweetie, if you want to do everything, suppose that you want to get an apartment
]
and that, and that you don't know anyone
have you asked someone about this?
no, I haven't asked, everyone told me to just put up ads
no, but you have to remember with them, you have to have an idea of what you have to do, and what you can do and what you can't do
with the office of the
sure, there they tell you everything, exactly what you can do and how it is
yes but I'm waiting until the end, if you understand me, so that you already know something
sure and I'm seeing, let's see, I'll send you the fax tomorrow
okay, I was going to tell you that I hadn't heard news about this
today I wrote the letter, it's just that I'm worried about all these returns here
oh, ok, alright
The, let's see] have you got enough money? so far
I have paid all that has arrived, today I paid the cell phone, the TV is already disconnected, and also arrived the fucking.. not the check, but the fucking credit
perfect
and also the newspaper, it didn't come yesterday or today, already
and the state check has not arrived, has it?
no, that hasn't arrives yet, mm, what else?
it's alright
oh, I can't remember what it was!
well, my darling
eh, no, ah, I asked for some extra work in the circus but they taold me not
they told you not? how comes?
because, because supposedly I can work at home until october, but I thought I'll talk to them anyway, you know what I mean, I'll cry the old lady, but she told me not
aha, distortion, oh, yes, well
but not for this, so I'm looking for another job, even if it's only for the weekends or whatever, OK
well, and haven't you called? shit
no
well
no, I have to go, I have to go for the check and the fax, but why would I go until you don't send the fax?
sure, I wanna send it tomorrow, but I don't know, it depends on whether I manage to get to Gino's
Okay, and the other thing is, have you talked to mom?
no
Well, look, mom has to be here in Bogotá next Friday, because Aunt Mecha's birthday is on Saturday
ah, that's good
She usually flies on Friday, please tell her that I can't call her, ask her to tell Aunt Mecha that I don't have money to call her right now
That I feel really bad and sad about not calling her, but right now I'm not in a position to do anything
Okay, and don't forget to tell her about my brother

who knows what to do, we´re supposed to be paying like a hundred and one dollars to people, and cooperating, and all that could have
well, yes, but who knows, he might be thinking about buying another one
no, I don´t think so, what does that mean? that maybe we´ll lose the house and will have to rent?

¿what's wrong, why aren't you going together?
I don't, i don't, i don't know if we're going together or not
i have
Because Edua-
¡Huh!
if Edu goes to IBM, i don't know, this dude wants to leave now and i can't go now
I'm free, i'm free, let's say, from twenty to about five, i think
of December
from December twenty until January five
And i could
or it would be
you can
it would be really good if we could, if we could hook up fifteen days together or ten days together and if if they can continue alone after
well if, he can, it's possible that one goes alone the first fifteen and me the last fifteen I don't know
because
what happens is that I'm going to have to take in November
ah
November, it's already November, Edu
yes in fifteen days, dear, I, I'm separating the things from the backpack I didn't tell you anything no I have to take vacations before starting in IBM because otherwise I don't have vacations until ninety six
are you thinking of coming to visit me eh for my birthday?
no I have no clue where I'm going to go party I have no clue but I have to call IBM to see how, how I negotiate my incorporation to IBM
aha
to IBM Zior!
I found out something I don't know from where but I found out something from the letter of, I found out from somewhere
oh my!
Ah from your letter? no!
see that I sent it? you received the letter, the other letter that I sent you with Ori's mom?
no the one who's leaving, the one who's leaving around the twentieth is Pablo Lates eh
ah well to where?
yes there to the United States
to the United States
yes I already know I already know
I mean around the twentieth of October
we have to send the pictures through him
I sent you the pictures Sior
great
when did you send them?
with Ori's mom
well I, listen to me one thing no because what I thought when you told me that Adrie is that, is that
aha
yes
eh, it's going to be a lot of money for there for you for fifteen days, if you later don't dare to continue alone
but too much money to go where to a beach like that
sure to any place
Roatan
to Roatan for example
yes because, in Roatan I dare to be alone
you are going to be a month in Roatan?
be careful Adri
Eh?
a month in Roatan?
no but what I know. I don´t know, the same I don´t know, maybe I went for two days yes, until December and also the seventh of July and who is laughing as a puppy?
I
so
so what
we don´t have to see, we have to see well the dates , I have the  next week a meeting in IBM and one of the issues I am going to talk is about, take vacations before, my incorporation, I am going to see if I can incorporate in, in January, a think I don't think They will, they will give me but
Hmm
eh sixty more days is kind of difficult to receive, I made the clinical tests they took blood samples
Oh poor little thing!
it was  very hard, it was very hard, it was very hard
you don´t know don´t know the story
listen to something and the, you don't know why, because I did not begin, I did not begin and I will not begin to look for a price or something until knowing a concrete thing because
not spare time here to find out
uh you are a Yankee, you are a Yankee , now is the efficience
so what
nothing good and well there is not need to find out, we investigated a week before or two
no it is fine
no but you have to find out listen
no, no, see that for me to, to buy the travel tickets with one or two weeks in advance it could be half the price eh here changes
the double
double, right
not the half
not the double
so, mm, well, wait a little more because soon it will the last minute, mm, what else did I want to tell you?
aha]
eh, oh!, I loved it when you were all there the other day
] eh? there at home?
yes
but it was crazy, it was paranormal, I swear Georgina that it was the first time we met, and we were not even coming here, we were going to the seacost
and to me
it was craz-
and it was crazy to me, because I was calling and I was certain I would leave you a message because I never thought you would be there but I just felt like calling you, so I did
but it was not till the very last minute, we were going to the seacoast because Coco Lozano was leaving, then I thought about showing Majo a video about whales, and I told them to come home, finally I didn't even show them the video
and I don't know, five minutes before you called, we hear the entryphone and we all three say at the same time, Georgina, we find it so natural you come
and five minutes later you call, it's like witchcraft
were they happy then?
oh no, we were upset
oh!
I started working doing that to, to Guay
Right
I'm living in Robinson's house, who's a friend of Sergio
Uh huh
For a couple of months, no more, let's say he allowed me to save to send me to move alone, lease something on my own
Right, right
So i have my dorm, my things, i don't know, really good, because i have my dorm with my own bathroom and all
Oh, great
Super, yeah, that way, great, so
Yeah
I have to clean it like a kindergarten
Uh huh
And then do the greater cleaning and clean the showers
Right
and that's done at night
Right
You know, it's ten to nine here
Uh huh
And, let's see, ten to nine, i can talk until nine twenty, and , ¿what was i telling you?, well, I'm leaving in a while
Oh, right
to make this question.  No, it doesn't take much --
and you worked all night?
Huh?
All night?
No, well, it took like three hours, more or less, to do it --
Ah, yeah.
but it's physical work, you have, you have to sweep --
Sure, sure.
move chairs, pass the mop, wash a bunch of stuff, so, well --
it took it out of you.
And it's not much money, but it let's me pay for the future, let's say, you know?
Ah, great, better, that's great.
and today, and, they gave me the OK in a restaurant --
Hmm.
and I start work tomorrow --
ah, great.
so, obviously, since this is a night job, I get the night shifts in the restaurants, tomorrow, they'll give me the scheme that corresponds, and, and --
Yeah.
but it will be really hard because I start at six in the afternoon until like twelve at night in the restaurants --
It's hard.
And from there i have to go clean other two things
Damn, that's a lot, ¿huh?
Well, but, but
You have to start somewhere
But it's ok, damn I'm so lazy, well, ¿what good is complaining?, that's it
Uh huh, but you have to start somewhere. Hey, uh, and well, and there, i hope you stay, you stay for a while, or ¿do you plan on staying for a while and coming back to San Francisco later?
I don't know, well, i have to see my options. First, i have to try, i have to see what i can do, what i can't do
Right
How much can i earn, how much... i don't know, ¿right?
Right
Because here, the cost of living here, let's say is a lot cheaper than living in California
Oh, right
So i, i went to see an apartment, just looking, because i don't plan on leaving for about two months
Sure
uh, and for three hundred and fifty dollars, three hundred and seventy dollars, i can lease an apartment
Uh huh
Damn, it was great to me, can you imagine, a place
Uh huh
plus the bedroom
Well, all set then
¿Right?, but it was fun, because it's got a refrigerator, a kitchen, air conditioning, so, ¿what else could i want?, well, if it's just for me
Yeah, logically, of course
But well, i have to start buying furniture and all that stuff, so
Sure, and, ¿did you get the license?
But i feel, ¿huh?
¿The licence?
Yes, i have the Florida license
Oh, right, right, good
i have it here, and besides, i don't know, it seems they're gonna send me the one from Texas, both
Right, oh, that's good
We'll see what happens. I think, well, i see
And with that
¿Huh?
¿With that you're legal?
No, you're crazy
Oh right
You're crazy, but at least i can move, well, from one place to another
Sure, sure
That's what matters most
Right
so, well, this is the question.  Today the car broke down so I had to take it to the mechanic --
Yes, so-
It will cost me I don't know much but expensive, but --
Eh, maybe it will be cheaper to sell it and buy another one.
Eh. -- Yeah, yes, well, I've thought about it, but I have to have some money to buy the other one, then.
Well, I imagine. ]
Well here buying a car isn't hard, but you have to have some money, something in your pocket, and right now I don't have anything, I have --
Yeah.
twenty something dollars, this is my whole worth, only what I have here in my wallet.
Chu!
You see.  I won't have a peso more for about two weeks.
That's crazy!
So, besides, it's -- Today a crane came to take the car, and everything and whatever --
Hmm.
and I fixed this so Robinson will pay me, let's say, because I don't have a cent.  Do you realize?
Aye, yeah.  The chicken paddles.
But well, it will be taken out of what he pays me.
Sure, yes.
So I don't have a cent ] for the rest of the month.  Damn!
Ah chu - you're up to your ears!
But at least not --
You're screwed
I was screwed from the first --
Well --
but at least you'll have a car when you go, you know?
Sure, so you can go everywhere --
So that, sure.
Hey, and did you stay on good terms with Gustavo and Sergio?
What, I didn't hear anything from you, I didn't hear anything from you, what?
Did you stay on good terms with Gustavo?
Yeah, yes, no problem, and we left each other with a hug and everything, yes, I didn't tell Gustavo --
Yeah.  Sure.
I didn't tell him anything, I didn't tell him anything.  But, damn, if you see the grass, the bad grass that's growing quickly, and you're waiting for it to catch your feet, better to go then --
Of course.  Logically.  Sure.
This was what I did.  You know?  The dude heals himself every night and starts with his sermons, monologues for hours, and you can't stop him because --
Shoot, how annoying.
worse than, I'll tell you, Look, you know, that mass, shut up, dude.
Yes.
But if you're living in his house, you can't, well, you know?  You have to be quiet.
You can't, sure.
Then, like or not, I had to put up with his night sermons
What sermons? About what?
about, about, about everything, and the problem is that since I was working with a friend of him, look I don't know, it's hard to explain, you have to live the situation to grasp it, because --
Well
everything can be misunderstood, you know what I mean?, the thing is that I didn't like at all the ambient or what the future might come up to
I see
I was visualizing this shit in a very near future --
Mmm
And, since I don't want to have problems with anyone and specially problems related to money, I preferred to leave --
Well, hold on a--
sure, and so, and you say, why didn't you get a job and went to live on your own in Miami, because I didn't have a buck --
Mmmm
because that would mean I would be into a lot of shit and problems, and I am not willing to do that any more --
I see
I was through a lot of shit in Chile and I don't want to keep messing around, you know what I mean, it is hard enough being in a different country, I mean, for you --
Sure
I left, that's it, knowing I had other alternatives in other places. That is the que-
Sure
That is the question
this week I will send you an address I found one day, to get the visa and the residence in the United States --
Yeah.
I don't know how it comes because there was a notice, there was a notice in the newspaper, that you have to write because they'll give you an answer with the information.
Yeah.
and so, this is in New York, eh, I imagine that everything will be by mail, because they say that they're regulating, the government, five thousand visas for Chilenos.
Ah, five thousand, mom told me fifty one thousand.
Or fifty five thousand, I don't know, something like that.
Yeah.
So imagine, yes, yes it's real --
Yes, well, I told mom, pass the issue to me, so I'll start to find out, then.
Yes.  Yes, you have to wait, the paper said, you have to have sent the letter today --
Yeah.
so you have to wait for an answer, then.  This will be an avalanche of people asking for the same thing, what, what can they do, then.
Sure, sure.  Ah, you sent the letter in Chile.
Hmm, so, sure yes the idea is this, you're from here, ah --
Ah, I grew up, I thought that they had sent me this thing already, ah.
No, no, no, no.  No, yes, you have to do it here, to manage it here.
Sure.
Yes, it's possible to manage it there, well, they send the records so that you can do it.
Yeah, yeah.
Cachai.  So this is the idea.
Oh well, that's the problem. Hey, well, and?
and what?
What, what, what can you tell me?
Well, oh, we have problems the company has sold and the new owners haven't said anything to us yet, nothing, we were all fired as of the thirty first
Fuck!
and I'm still, I still have to go to work along five others, we must leave everything in order and close the office from the street, goodbye.
I see.
But we are hopeful that they'll rehire us.
I see.
because, this company was bought by another company from Ecuador.
I see.
so, they'll need personnel to handle it.
I see.
it's not just about taking people from the street, lazy.
Sure, of course.
and well, we've had some difficult days, I was really glad there, I had learned lots of things and and I was growing fast to get to the commercial are of the company, oh
I see.
I was now working in sales or reservations, promotions.
I see.
I was interested in sales, more than anything, so, suddenly, this happened and you know, for me it has been terrible.
Yeah.
because it was really hard for me to get to that level and I'm really on the same level as people who have been working for a minimum of ten years.
Yeah.
So you ask me now how, I don't know, having the books here, I can't give you a tariff around the world with different alternatives, different things than a person who has worked for ten years in this.
Yeah.
I removed the crest --
Hmm.
to, to be able to advance and grow, and let's say recently this issue stopped and here the assholes don't buy it anymore.
Yeah.
But, like I say, the last word still hasn't been said, I keep going to work, administration things, administrative, and as long as they don't tell me to go home, I keep going.
Logical, then.
and hopefully it's a way to keep yourself in it, then.
Yeah.
in any way, I was also going to contact Ladeco.  All the aerial companies here in Chile are so bad, all of them.
Yeah.
I'm also going to contact Ladeco and Lan, and National, on my behalf, without pitutos, like --
It would be good if, if we talk with the bishop --
Yes, sure.
and if he gives you the opportunity, to tell him your situation.  How is the bishop with you?
Ah, fine, excellent, ah.
Yes.
Excellent, excellent, yes
But do you tell him all your problems?
Yes, he knows everything, he knows everything
Aha, and what does he tell you?
Like, sure, he advises me, he tells me the things that I have to do, he orients me, ah, like I tell you, here it's really difficult, they will make, they've formed, like I told you, a workshop --
Aha.  Aha.
For work and everything, orientation and all this.
And --
And I'm enrolled too.
aha, but --
This was a short time ago, recent-
Oh, yes?
No, no, no, no, no, not long ago, a short while ago, recently, like I told you.
Aha, but like I told you, you should talk to the bishop and ask him to recommend you to find a job there in the temple, different things.
Yes, exactly, I've talked with several people too.  I talked with several people and we'll see what happens, if --
Aha. Right now you're alone in your house or who are you with.
I'm alone.
Alone, and where is she --
It's that, mom has gone out, mom has gone out. She has gone out to look for Fabricio.
Oh, oh, she went to Fabricio, to look for him.
Yes, she went to look for Fabricio.
Oh. Oh, but where abouts, far away or --
Over there, over there by the house, more or less --
Ah.
More or less. You know that we have moved, right?
Yes, yes well. Dad told me all your, aha, I already spoke to yeah --
We are in another place, so she went to look for, she has gone to look for him there.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But everything is fine right now.
yes, the family how is it.
Well we are all fine, you see, well the kids are bigger now, going to school and all that.
Ah, what you, I didn't recognize you
The truth.
Yes, ah, has happened --
You are also very different, ah.
Yeah I can  imagine, well, I can imagine, everything changes, changes --
Well, everything changes, we here also have lots of
Yes but I, tell me.
Yes, we also have lots of problems here, do you understand, but that's how life is, that's what we came here for, to stand all these problems that we get
Exactly, all of them
and aha, we have to try to overcome them, do you understand?
Mmm, ex
It doesn't matter if we fall down, what type of problems you've had with my mom and dad
Oh, they are as always, they are from the church.
Oh.
The support, I mean, there's none, there's no support in that regard, the Gospel.
But, what is that they want you to do that you don't want to do?
Oh, I don't know, I once asked my mom and she was like, mom, tell me, you know, tell me these things that you want me to, you are okay my daughter but instead, she told me, she spoke to me about church.
and everything is connected to the church, yes mom, I was saying, no? I have lots of calls and things that I have to go to
But how much time do you spend in church?
look, when there are some activities, sometimes, every week, but when there are none, well some days she goes to school, you know, other days she has other activities that are well, two or three times, and on Sunday
Two or three times per week?
Per week, mmm.
Plus Sunday?
Yes, plus Sunday.
Well, what, how?
The classes and those things, the classes and those things that
What classes do you take or give you.
Of institute.
Oh, you are going to the institute then?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Listen, another thing I was going to tell you, ah, mom and dad are quite worried about what happened with your boyfriend, so I don't know how you're taking that.
Oh, they already told you, right? Yes, they are
Ah, well
Tell me
Ah, the other time that I called, more or less she told me, you should've told me all that in the letter, also, you understand me?
Yes, you wanted me to tell you, but I mean, it's something really sad, right?, but that I'm already overcoming, well.
Okay, well look
You know, okay, okay
but you know that, what gets me sad is, ah - there are, are things that will happen, you understand me?
Mm.
but, for example, is a little, like, like mom tells me, you understand me?
Yes
how, how can that happen, supposedly you go to a mission so that, you understand me? I mean, they see you
Yes, is, is, precisely because of that that my mom attacks me, that's where she attacks me
I mean, they, no, attack it because they don't really understand, so
I explain to my mom, I tell her that every young person that goes to her mission does the mission, right? all are not the same, logically, I have friends that have done with their things that they've fulfilled, but
Well no, is that also
It happens, well I say.
Aha,
Is that look, it was so nice, everything was so nice
What happened
I mean, precisely that, it was so nice, and with only well it must have been like five months left, like that
Aha.
started, he sent me a letter well, telling me that no, no,but  then he sent me another one, that the same, that everything continued normal, that to wait for him, right?
Ah.
that to wait for him to continue with the goals, with the plans that we had, but
Yes.
when he arrived here, it was already different ah, well, I don't know
But what, did he fall in love with another girl, a missionary, or something like that?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, yes.
Oh, okay, okay.
Imagine but you know what
Well is, it must have been very hard, sister.
But,
Look, you have to take these things, I mean, take this, the Bible teaches us that we must be a bit cold when we face problems like that
Yes, but this
because the feelings, how?
I'm a well, I'm too sensible and very sentimental, I believe, it's too much
I believe you are, we are all like that, we are sentimental.
Oh, but I mean, I honestly think that in the beginning, I was doing really bad, really bad
I believe so, that's that's
Mom, I'm causing you pain
That, I mean, oh?
It was terrible, terrible, terrible.
I believe so.
But, you know, fine, the Gospel, we know why we are here in this Earth, the Lord will give us opportunities, no?
Sure, I mean
I'm doing better now, really great, so
Aha, but, how, how did it affect you, it left you, you left, how, how was it, how did you react?
Yes, but look
Oh.
I was hurt and I got depressed, I got depressed and I did so many things I mean, I was with him for five years, so, I left everything, all my plans, what could I do, no?
Aha
that it was already, okay no - like I say, I'm not a young girl, right? okay, okay I was saying
Well I already know
Ah, how nice
And what, for example, the bishop, what did he advise you.
He, when I told him all this, we had an interview, he told me to give him time.
Aha.
eh, time to think, that he was going to come to do the things here, that he was now -- but time was passing, time was passing and it wasn't working, he didn't react, everything was going worse.
You, well, that on your part or
On his part, ah, because I was here saving as always, but, I tell you that I had a month ago an interview with the bishop because we interview every month, I was talking with him
The bishop, for example
and he told me that no already
He didn't tell you that perhaps you could go to the mission or something like that?
Yes, he told me to decide.
And, what have you thought about this.
and well no, and I'm thinking, like I tell you, I just did an interview with him and he told me that no already, to leave that, that I couldn't continue being
How long has it been since this happened already.
It's been three months, already.
Oh, it hasn't been long.
Okay.
It's just been three months.
Okay, Mm.
Ah, well, then there's still a chance. You are going through a very hard time, you understand me?
Yes
But you know what, sister, you have to try to overcome this and forget, and, you understand me -- what you have to do is rather, try to get ahead and, especially settle down, perhaps find a job that. I know that it's very difficult in Peru, you understand me? now
Ah?
It's really, really hard.
I know, but like I tell you, the thing is that -- it would be good that, whether with the brothers or something, there should be some contact around there that perhaps can help you find some job, in whatever, understand? for
Yes, like I tell you, here it's made, I mean, here in the workshop that we have with my mom
Aha.
Ah, it has increased, it has increased, right? then already, for example, I've already been able to save some money, a little more, to, to study, what I have left to study, because look, it's been more, than how long since I've studied right? and it's that I'm not up to date, at all.
Aha. Well when, of what you studied, of what you studied, for example, it was secretarial work, right?
Yes, but now all that is with computers, understand?
Aha everything is computers, so.
but nothing.
And you didn't take any, any computer class in your secretarial course?
No course. No, no, no, Nothing.
What do you need to do, then.
Study that, and an update to study computerized secretarial work, that's what they ask.
Aha.
Then, yes, I've studied to save for that, some
¿And how much does that cost, well, let's say, tuition?
It's about, i mean, the enrollment
Right
it's about seventy soles, well, oh, well, in dollars
Right, you don't know, more or less
Well, hang on a second, uh
nine fifty, ¿what time did i started working?
Seventy dollars more or less
That's, what, ¿for how long?
Mmm, yeah. What a pity.
She just left, just now, right now.
Give her plenty of hugs. How are they.
Yes, ah, good, listen.
Yes?
The one that remembers you most is mister Mecid.
Yes,
Oh, when you see him, we send you a letter, well they take a long time to arrive, your letter we received just today, Mrs. Petita brought it to me.
Ah, mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah, ouch, that's nice.
So that --
And, and, what do you call it, who else have you heard of. and Manolo --
Look, from, from your friends --
Yeah, The Sole, na-
nobody has called, nobody.
The, the Sole eh, she sent me a letter.
Ah, she sent you. Yeah.
Yes. I received a letter from her. And Manolo --
Yeah.
well, with, with him I talked with. He hasn't called you?
Yeah. No.
Oh, that's odd
He/she Hasn't called me at all
That's odd
He/she hasn't called
He/she must be
Uh, from your...
still celebrating it's comeback
Ok, hey, uh, um, and, ¿why did he/she come back?
And Paty, because it turns out that, one, he/she lost her passport
OK
two, uh, he/she had to exchange her visa
OK
for a, uh, for the same one that Monica and Pablo have
OK
so, uh, he/she had to change it and he/se had to do all the paperwork there
Right
He/she couldn't do it here, so he/she had to come, i mean, he/she had to go
Ok, OK
but here we are, likewise, Manolo wrote me a super cute letter
OK
super cute, so I answered to her today
I see
and and I'll send her a letter tomorrow.
Hey, do you know who called? Wait a bit.
I see, I see.
The stove was on, with the, the
Oh, I see, I see.
with the pan on. Oh, lets see, the people from the place you had the insignias manufactured on, called today
The insignias? What did they say?
that they haven't looked for them, he explained everything
I see.
but that's why, I'm going to tell Veronica to look for the number so that I can call, I don't know who, but I'll have to call someone
Oh, look, look, it's best for you to call the bomb
Yes? The bomb?
The bomb, yes, where Manuel is.
Oh, I see.
and, but mom, Manuel, he's expensive, tell him it's urgent.
I see.
Tell him to call you, that it's urgent, that they have to take care of the insignia things. I already told Manolo, too, well.
I see.
In any case, Goya has the papers and they have to do the paperwork
Right
I think they must not have the money yet
Right, right
So, that must be what happened with them
Right. Hey, tell me, ¿what have you been doing?, ¿what have you known?
Look, i met the Dallas Museum
Right, right
which is beautiful. I met some part
Right
we went one day with Monica, and i visited a part of it, but it's really nice
Right
Uh, we went to the zoo
Right
It's beautiful, we didn't saw it completely either
Right
But there's a lot of amazing stuff
Right
And there are... we went to some lakes
Right
that's close by here, it's the food for ducks, like, there's ducks, geese, different things --
Yeah.
and besides, they lakes are all artificial, they're not real, and --
Yeah, ah!
Eh, in the first days we went to some toy things for kids, with Sofia --
Yeah, yeah.
and it turned out, we really had fun, Pablo and I because there are toys and things, and it's really nice, great.
Well, hey, tell me, and the food.  How have you found the food?
Eh, practical things.  Lentils --
Yeah.
now we eat frozen lentils that we have.
Yeah.  Yeah.
and for example, instant puree, rice that you make in the microwave, eh --
Yeah, yeah.
chicken, the other day I had a chicken recipe that Monica gave me, or if not, we go out to eat.  Last night we went out to eat.
Yeah, yeah.
Or if not, Monica recently makes meat, all these kinds of things she makes, and I make the sal- well, I wash the lettuce --
Yeah.
tomatoes and thing like that, and well, they're not big things --
Yeah, yeah.
And to tell the truth, for example, i didn't have anything to do today, because i went out in the morning
Right, right
And then i went shelving, looking at thins
Right
and i got here at around three
Right
And i, i watched TV, rested, because i have to walk, i walk practically an hour a day
Right
So
Well, and, ¿have you gotten thinner or not?
No, I'm the same. I find my self the same, the, the
¿Yeah?, damn it
I'm the same, i don't know why i haven't weighed myself here, besides, here when i first stepped on it, oh my god, it was horrible, and it's pounds here, it's different, it's like twice your weight
Right
for example, if i weight sixty kilos, here i weight a hundred and sixty, one hundred and twenty pounds, something like that
Right
So i went on the scale, ¡Whoa, one hundred kilos!, i was imagining strange things
Right, no, but try to lose weight, do some exercise
Yes, yes, like, since i have
so you'll look pretty
Okay,
Listen, what friends have you made there.
Nobody, well, if here, mom, if I go out in the street, outside
Okay
and by the path, you see there's no sidewalk
Okay
practically, no everywhere, there's no one
Okay
not a soul, everybody, pure cars, pure cars.
Okay, okay, okay, okay
running over there and over here, the only thing you see, but there are Chilean people
Okay
that, that with them, I mean, we communicate a lot
Okay
and they are super loving, really, super loving, so, but to me
Okay, Listen, but you haven't done any other work?
Eh, well, I've taken care of two, two little kids
Okay.
eh, for, for a few hours
Okay
and, well, that we will see later on, if anyway
Okay
at the moment it's not so necessary.
Okay
but, ah
Okay. Listen, but study something that, I mean
Yes, no yes, look
don't get into too many things
No, no, no.

No, look, I want to study English, English only.
Okay.
I want to understand English well and so there I am. Today I went to
Okay.
so
Okay.
Monday, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I have classes.
Ah, okay.
It's two hours daily, in the morning, so
Okay, ah how nice.
No, and afterwords, when i finish
Hey, the other day you lost Sofia, huh
Yeah, damn, Sofia's scared us two times now. One day, uh, i mean, Pablo got here and Sofia hadn't, i thought it was odd, and well, it was late, like six, and then Mónica came
Yeah
and, ¿right?, she tells me, ¿where's Sofia?, and, no, she hadn't arrived, and she got scared, because she went to the kindergarten and she wasn't there
Right, right
And, of course, the moment she went there
Yeah
and the lady that goes and gets her was already coming, of course
¿She had her?, right
So, they didn't, they didn't meet
Right
And we were all desperate, so we were really scared. Anyways, Pablo was relaxed, he
Yeah
he's like that, from another world, huh
Yeah
unbelievable
Yeah
And Mónica was really scared, well, i was scared too
Yeah
And we went to the supermarket the other day, they are huge, and Sofia got lost, and Sofia, she went to the candy section and what's this
and then suddenly I look, because just in that moment we were talking about me staying there and then Pablo was going to go look for me.
I see.
and the three of us, we were talking about that and Sofia, of course, she disappeared and I asked Monica, Monica, is Sofia there, and she said no, she told me, I'm going to go look for her because there is a candy section so she went and she wasn't there, and then I went to the toy section and she wasn't there either, she is always in the toy section
and so we started looking for her everywhere and then we went to the information module so, oh, mm, we found her there, I was so scared because at least, Monica and I, we got really scared but Pablo
Oh, he's
Well, that's the, oh.
That's right, no, but she's quite rich, she's a giver.
I see, I see.
So when she misbehaves, not with me, she knows it's not worth it, no, but
I see.
She's a giver. Now, I bathed her
Well, and have you been playing the guitar or not.
No, not at all, I haven't played it. It's just that
Did you see, yes, what did I tell you?
it's because, it's because, no, you think I'm not going to do it but I will, but I first need to study English because I've been studying with the books that I brought here
I see, I see.
and I want to study English and then I can practice the guitar, because
I see.
I really can't do both things at the same time, what-
No, yes it is good not to get in so many things. To finish one well finished --
Yes, no, that, and after that I will continue with another, yes total --
Of course, no --
and also after that I am going to be like more comfortable with English, then I am going to be more relaxed.
Yeah.
However if I take the guitar and English, it is too much, I want to take one thing, so what --
Yeah. Yeah. Listen, what else are you going to tell me.
Eh, well that here the thunder and lighting are incredible, mommy, all the house moves. It rains so much --
Yeah. Listen, I am confused with your uncle Roli, do you remember the -- story that say that the lady had a --
In three matches, nine points
From Tocornal, yes, that me laugh a lot
Yes, yes, yes, but --
But this is boring here
Because, no, nothing, because you told me in the letter. Let's talk in the terms of San Vicente, otherwise they will understand us, let's talk in the terms of San Vicente, like pea, otherwise they will understand us
No, what? you're going too far. No, I don't think they'll use 'pea' in the study, not such things, I think
So, you are bored, aren't you?
Yes, because I have the whole day busy and after half past six it is very dangerous to go out alone, because they kill people
Because -- Really?
Yes, one week before I came, in my same street, they killed a person
Yes
In the street where I live, three blocks from here. But they killed him for five dollars, that's less than thousand pesetas, three black men beat him and robbed him, one said he's gonna recognize us, he's gonna report us, the other took a gun and pum, a shot in the heart
They hit the other so much that the next day he didn't remember if they had asked him for money first or they had hit him first, he didn't remember anything, but anyway, nothing has happened to me so far
What time is it there right now?
Half past five, almost, no a quarter past five
No, well, so, retiring already when you finish?
No, about seven I usually go together with a Japanese and a French guys to buy food across the street
Dinner. How about the friends?
Yes, dinner, of course. Well, there is quite a lot of Spanish people, today I am going to a classical music concert
Yes
yes, because I have to go to classes, there's the homework.
Yes.
And that's it, and sure, until five ten, I'm busy the whole day.  I get up at seven --
Yes.
I start classes at eight to nine forty --
Yes.
and from nine forty to eleven is the only free space I have, I come to the room to have breakfast and eat breakfast at eleven and start work.  I work from eleven to two, from two to three like-
at three I start classes again and I finish at five ten, at five ten I come here and study, and at seven I go there, and sometimes I go to the pool or something like that, but it's boring.
Boring.
yes, there's nothing to do, since I'm not twenty one I can't go anywhere.
And the people you hang out with are twenty one, the people you hang out with, yes.
Who, with the people I go, the oldest I hang out with, is thirty.
Ayyye!  Thirty.
Just turned, just turned.
Damn.
The, the other's twenty seven, there's a Catalan who's twenty eight.
Damn, so
So, there's no one my age, people my age are in Spain, sure.
Yeah.  Damn.  Well here, I already told you many things, I wrote you a really long letter
Ah, good, good, good, good, but every day I look in the mailbox and I never see anything.  Marta wrote me the other day.
Yes
Just one page
It's her fault too, I told you that in the, in the letter, I was talking to, yes, I told you that in the letter, I was talking to Marta this saturday, no, last Saturday
hmmm
I think it was last Saturday that I talked to Marta because of all those things you told me, I give you the details in the letter, and all I know is when you come you have to talk to her
yes, yes, yeah
When you come she wants to talk to you, I mean, when you come for Christmas, just get in touch with her and talk and all that, because I
Bah
She doesn't regret anything that happened
hmm
so that day was no cause of regret, no
Hmm
Now she didn't tell me what really happened, why she left like that, but whether she had something else to do or not, when you come you have to talk to her and stuff
And why do I have to talk to her
Damn, because that's what I was able to get from her during, during the time I was talking to her, what happens in her letters tells me that she doesn't know what to write, it's that I don't know what to tell him, don't know what to tell him or anything
Did she get any of my letters? did she? how many?
Eh? Yes, she got them, she got them. I don't know how many, no
I sent her the postcard, the postcard and four more letters
Yes, she got the postcard because we were talking about it, yes.
Yes, the postcard too because she talks about the postcard in her letter. I sent her the postcard and four more letters.
Yes. Four, boy!
Yes, I sent you four, three, to Teresa, four and five. I wrote a lot, but you don't get them.
Jo- I just got two.
They'll get there.
The postcard and two more.
They'll get there eventually, they have to get there and then you'll get the one that I wrote after your letter.
Aha. Well, have you, oh?
That's right, I don't think about her that much now,
You are doing better.
Now I'm thinking about going back to Spain to eat right.
Just to eat. The other day I wrote you a letter, look, between Edgar and myself, around thirty toast during the night, oh.
but, we were, both of us, we left and you found us in the gabacho,we ordered some drinks. You toast for Miguel from Philadelphia and he had no idea who you were but you still wanted to toast with him, so we had around thirty drinks.
I like that, I do.
I mean, Edgar and I started the night, a party, we started with that
Mmm and well, the beer that they sell here is Bubd, Budvaiser, all of it, but, oh.
Yes, I see, I see, so you wrote me a letter. All, all, all.
I have a box in my room with twenty four.
Aha.
Man, they also have, I mean, the one that is more, more
Lets see, when you go there, if you want I can send you Estrella's box, if you miss her I'll send you Estrellita's box.
No.
Yes. He's fine, yes.
Fine, well I think this is working.
Yes, it's working now, and mm, this, this, this weekend, this weekend, what did you do this weekend, I think that this weekend ended like the rosary, like aurora's rosary.
.
I see, well, I had to talk to Martha on the weekend, and then she got mad at me, so I had to stand it, so, then I found her and then, everyone was in a different mood so
Mmm, yes. I see, I see, you were delayed.
Yes, I was delayed and all that but that's the only way for me to, sure, we do play on Saturdays, so, so, we were coming back after playing on Saturday, we were cheering
Mmm, sure, that's luck.
Fuck, I miss you, fuck
What are you saying
Oh?
You, mother.
That I, fuck I miss you and Dany does too.
Dany hasn't written to me yet.
He hasn't written to you yet?
No, or at least I haven't received any letters from him. I got your letter, Teresa sent me two and I got one from Juan but that's all.
You just got that four?
Yes and one from Martha.
Five.
Yes.
Well, sweetie, tomorrow surely will be the latest it gets to you, if I sent it Thursday night, eh?  Like, it will arrive Friday morning.
Ah, today I didn't look, today I didn't look, today I didn't look in the mailbox, so --
And I sent it urgently, no, it has to come for sure, eh, it has eleven, I don't know if it comes tomorrow, or the next day, like very late, what happened is that it was heavy, so --
Hmm, yeah.
And hmm, And hmm, it's my turn to write you, no?
Yes, me too, I should write again, I'll wait to get your letter.
Yes, wait, yes, so then you'll answer me.
So you have to get three of my letters, it seems.
Three of yours, more.
It seems so.  How many did you get, two, no, then two more.
Two, yes, two more.  Damn, it's very late, huh?  how strange.
Yes, well, don't talk about letters, since we have a short time, the letters will come.
How strange.  Yes, yes, yes, what more can I tell you about here, well, I'm studying here, that's good
Aha, yes, don't worry, for me it was pretty good that it was selective, the last day they told me, we're going to turn around, on the last day we won't study, and then I said, crap.
That yeah you told me about - huh?
Of course, of course, I was thinking about studying on the last day, they told me that they had to turn around --
Yes, yes, look your result now, being lazy and --
Yes.
and it's true, they send you memories of Cegade, I forgot to send you Cegade's address, in the letter, I have to --
Now I don't
No, not anymore, it's the same, I'll send it to you in the next letter.
And, don't you know about the twins?
I have no idea. I'll try to find out
Yes, because Terersa doesn't know
Maybe through Sandra
Well, and how is Teresa?
Teresa. Teresa is a pain in the neck, the other day, she is still with Julio and then, shit, that --
Oh yes, she told me something about Julio in the letter. What happened with Julio?
Waht, what did dhe tell you?
that Manel said you were, that she was with Julio, that you called Manel every name under the sun because I hadn't, she hadn't, that she was with Julio, that she was wit hanother
Yes, well, she is with Julio, and let me tell you, I saw them one day, and I think she saw me because she looked at me --
Mmm
and she didn't say hello, she looked straight ahead. She was with Julio, you know what I mean?
Mmm
and I got mad, very, very much, and then she told me that no and no, she promised and promised that no, so, I finally believed her
Maybe she didn't see you
Yes, sure, and the way things are now for me, mmm, nothing, she doesn't go out with me, she doesn't want to go out with me, but we do talk, we call each other and, well --
And she with one, right?
The other broke off, but the other --
I also laughed when I read about the
Wait, the other broke off, mmm, and then came her best friend trying to convince me to go out with the other, I mean, with Teresa, her best friend, a
It's expensive.
Yes there are lots of banks closed and they are paying, the ones that pay more, pay around a twenty percent.
I see, so around a twenty percent?
Around the twenty, just imagine.
Yes, I already knew that.
So, I rather stayed in.
Mmm.
in the house, as Wily said, this house is worth six, seven million, the house alone.
Yes, aha
Aha, it's really big.
Oh, that's great, cool.
Sure, so I rather invested in it and I don't have to be in a bank earning nothing.
Sure.
The apartments, they are overvalued every day more, the money is there.
That's not, they can lease it and earn some money.
They can lease them, yes. I  asked how much could I charge for leasing an apartment in this side.
Aha.
and they told me that, with a purchase option, which never really happens, I could charge forty thousan
Aha.
and if they don't buy it I can raise it to fifty.
OK.
Yes, it's worth it.
Sure.
Yes, the one that he bought for me here, by chance is from Carachi.
Ah.
I came to know after I had bought it.
That's good.
And it came from Caracas and that one fell blind.
Aha.
Aha.
Ah, but it's that the apartment is very nice.
No, it's very nice, but the location and the years of construction at the same in which I bought.
Yes, OK.
It's not the same in the West than in the East.
Exactly.
What she, as she doesn't know, as she doesn't live here --
Mmm.
well, I'm going East and I leave her here stuck in the West.
And how did she sell that one.
Well, p-
By a landlady? oh, OK
By an agency. I placed it and then retired it, but she came and I kept my word, just oral no papers
OK
That's how I got to sell it
Oh, great
Today I signed the sell, thank God. Maribel says she was relieved
Really?
Oh, yes, because we will get out of here
Oh, figure
Because I was fed up, not with the apartment but the people
Yes, I know
They cornered me too much
What a drag!
They send me to the east, they send me to the east and they send me to the east, and I will please them
Right
Since we are so obedient --
Yes
No, we will please them, after all
Mmmm
And I lost nothing, quite the opposite, that old man was selling off because he was on trail with his son and he gave it to me cheaper
But what I had left over from this I put into the house.
That's good.
I sold it for three fifty and what I bought was three hundred.
Ah, that's great.
Ah, well sure.  And right now I have to go and turk because I can't do anything else.
Sure, sure, sure.
Hmm, yes, there isn't any other way.
Hmm.  And the schools for the boys, finally.
Well, Rober is paralyzed there.
Aha.
Aha.  Alfredo is there.  Ah, he's flying, he's reading and writing according to him.
Okay, hmm.
yes, so, well, since we're going to Caudari and then they'll go to the Presentation School --
Aha.
the one with the monks, it's for males and females --
Okay.
well, I thought it was better to take myself there --
Okay.
now we're thinking of looking for the quota there to start January there in the other school --
Hmm.
I'm left with that.  No gasoline or rubber, then.
Well, exactly.  And how are the girls?
Happy because, shells, they'll go the breathe a little more, get out of the intrigue and the envy, the bad intention and everything.
Exactly.
And Soledad will breathe, and at least we have sun, space, everything there.
Sure, right, more open.
yes, more open.  We have a solar patio, everything, and we're alone.
Hmm.  Exactly.
Without these bad things there, stuffed and --
Hmm.
The gossip and --
Yes.
No, no, and far from everything.  The one who was very bad was my mom.
Ah, a joke and this shell!
Hmm, she obstructed a, the vein that goes close to the artery, but she, she doesn't really understand what is has.
Yes.
Aha.
Yes.
So it's bad, yesterday, this week, Juan Jose was coming from Carachi and Arceni --
He's, already in Carachi.
And it's not good, there they didn't give Yeyos, she stayed there.
Ah, what grass.
Aha.
Ah.

But she's at home or at the hospital.
No, she's at home.  They took her to the Valera clinic and they've done all the studies and the heart --
Okay.
Yes, they did all of this.
Ah.
and there's Juan Jose going forward and the doctor --
Yes.
the artist from the television and the doctor are those who can move the most there.
Aha.  Aye, there, I was telling Roberto that there isn't a telephone there.
Who.
In the house.
Well, no, I have the application --
Ah, okay.
I have someone who will install it --
Aha.
But i haven't asked for it until I'm there
Exactly
Because if not, it's trouble for me when they're working
And be careful when you're buying other lines again, remember what happened the last time with your nephew here
No, no, no, no, i, i asked for Cantebel
Uh huh
No, i did a request with Cantebel a while ago now
OK
And there's a chance they will install it. It's about time they do
Right
But until they, uh, a boy that studied with the girls is in Cantebel, he said they'll tell me when they move so that i can send for it to be installed
Uh huh, oh, OK
Right, it's directly through Cantebel, i, nothing on those pirate telephones
Right
It's, it's for Ricardo
Right
Here, they don't sell me dollars here because I'm not a businessman, you know
But they don't, if you tell them it's for a relative outside?
Nothing, they don't give me any, not to me. I have no proof, i have nothing at all, so, I'm screwed and i
That's something, because I'm
Then Marisol is telling me to bring Rober the batteries, which is the most important thing.
Yes.

Yes.
I'm also hung, but I'm getting by.
Mm, okay.
Yes, because I wanted to put the house nice.
Aha, sure.
I already ordered the gold letters and fourteen
No, and take advantage at once, because it's a thing how everything is increasing over there.
No, it's that everything is increasing.
Mm.
The letters cost me fourteen thousand bolivar.
The letters? that very
Yes sir, the letters of the house
No, no, no
Nothing more than a "Don Eugenio", just in gold
That's how the house is called, oh, that's such a nice name
Yes, yes, Don Eugenio, there is a glass window lower, fix in one side, and three little lamps
Right
Right, with yellow light so the golden letters will light up right
Uh huh, it's to show the brand of the, the batteries, because that joke... time

Eh, more or less what size is Alfredo, the shoes were ten twelve but he's gone up two more sizes, it bust be twelve fourteen.
Ah, that gizzard.
Believe me that Rober is thirty eight in shoe size, it's too big.
Ah.
Rober lost all of his clothes.
Well, you can keep it for the other one.
For Alfredo, but that's what we're doing, but Alfredo sees it as a cheat.
Sure, it has to be this way.
And the shoes are those that don't -
Size twelve fourteen, ah, the store is in front of the -
in front of where you bought them.
Okay, in front --
close to the sports, the sports store.
in front, ah, okay.
Aha, they're big and they have real deals, first they bring you in and then they have hooks to keep it up.
The fraud is that you know how they change these models, but you're not the same, huh?
Yes, but it's that they are police ones, they are police ones because several policemen stopped me around there to ask me where I had bought those boots of Alfredo
Okay
Yes, they are the only ones that correct his, his
Well, anyway, if not I'll find you some black ones
No, if it's really big. No, if they are black, well, they are good for school.

Because in the schools they ask for black.
Ah, okay.

She tells me, I think that it's more than two hundred, two hundred, two hundred.
Oh, my God.
It's not a waist or anything, that is
She lost all that, she was a fat lady with a waist.

It's that after twins mmm --
That's why Katy is skinny with the twins that she gave birth to.
Katy had twins?
Twins, boys.
Ah, the nerve.
She says that it almost became a belly, that the whole house got messed up.
Ah, the shit.
That she doesn't have time to even take a shower giving tit to one, giving tit to the other, and the older one that she has that gave her a terror like to Alfredo and he beats up the twin boys. Now she has three boys.
Ah, what a drag.
Yes, she says that it's very diff-
Ah, good heavens. At least the husband helps her a lot with the boys.
He resigned to some hours at the clinic to give her a hand in the afternoon, because they are that --
Sure.

Ah, no, And Mario never called me.
Ah, no, it is that when he called, when he told you that was going to call, I told him not to call you because --
And you did not gave him the telephone where I was going to be until Wednesday.
Well, you were on a trip, no, because you were in Oklahoma.
When he was going to call me, well he.
He, he called me I think on Wednesday, Wednesday.
Hmm, and see he had almost a week here and he didn´t call me.

Oh, but you're gonna laugh when you read it, but no
¿Did you call Juan Carlos Chan or did you forget too?
Oh, no, I didn't tell you the last thing that happened.
Oh? Oh!
I forgot too. You must understand that on Monday, they took out my molars and I was barely able to speak, I mean, I was able to speak but my cheeks were in pain, they were inflamed.
And then they turned purple, I spent the whole afternoon sleeping and so I wasn't able to call anyone, I wasn't even able to take a bath.
Oh.
Look, as you just said, my dad. What-
Hey, did you get Ligia's letter in the end?
Mom, not the letters for Ligia, right, mom forgot.
Oh, she's a, Evelyn sent a picture
Oh my God, it's like, my mom, look, she can barely hear anymore, she can't speak, she can't remember stuff.
Go tell her that, she sent some letters and some pictures for Evelyn, for Paty and I don't know who else, I'm still saying happy birthday to her.
She sent things for Evelyn and Paty and I don't know who else, tell, I swear, she sent them a while ago and my mom hasn't been there either.
She's a-
And there are some things for Magdalena's baby and she hasn't been there to drop them off.
You should learn how to drive and then you could do those things.
No, oh, no.
Oh, my God, had I been there I'd tell my dad, anyone, Mario, brother, please teach me how to drive a car.
My dad said that, my mom likes to go there everyday. My God, it's a big country now, they are building, the Periferico, down the road where they removed the Buenaventura.
Where, through the Novicentro, oh yes, around the Campero power, aha.
Oh, well, in the whole country.
Ah, yes.  Ah, so, the pu-
Yes, it's countryside but a little, on the top of there, ah?
tell Juan Carlos that I say hi and to write me and give him my address, and to Mauricio, even if it's to tell him that you were in the hospital all week --
because they operated on you, but tell him, no but give him the message, ah, my sister sent me a letter but I'm in the hospital since Saturday, tell him, until yesterday, so tell him that I couldn't --
Ah, that you were dying
for a whole week, tell him that it was to tell him even if it was late, happy birthday, that I told you, but since you were in the hospital and you couldn't, tell him that you couldn't talk because of the tooth, right, but don't forget, ah.
Well, I don't know
and that al- they'll say that you're not lying, that they will bring the letters where Evelyn, where Evelyn, no, where Licha.
Eh, Ligia, donkey.
Where Ligia, and look, I will give you an address because this Evelyn told me that since I, sometimes she puts zone seven on the address, but she had problems with her sister because her mom didn't --
you know, she died, right, her sister didn't give her the cards that I'd sent, so she gave me an address so, so she could give them to, I don't know, to a friend, to Elvira, my friend.
That Evelyn, the one who wears contact lenses.
yes, my friend, look, seventh avenue -- two sixty --
Aha, yeah?
Two, sixty --
Two sixty.
Aha, zone nineteen, in Florida --
Zone nineteen.
Yes, Florida, man, the one that's back there.
Florida?  And you want us to go there?
Yes, No man --
Already there's going to be more of a rest because these situations are upsetting
Jeez. And the girls how, and those girls how are they behaving.
Yes, here, here they are in the house, well good, good thank God.
And with you, good?
Okay, okay, okay, good, yes.
How good, man.
Okay, fine, yes, everything is calm already, everything is peaceful, thank God, right.
Yes. Mother-In-Law
So, Yes, Cheche?
Eh, here we have thirty minutes to talk in this call, understand.
Ah, really, no, How come?
Aha because it's, they are doing a research of how the voices are heard and that then is a free call.
Ah, aha, how nice, aha well, then I'm going to tell you that already, what do you call it, they are fixing the house, right
Oh, really?
The shame that they had to come fix the roof of the house - they already started, they've already been at it fifteen days.
And what, what, what is it they do, mother in law.
They have to throw away the whole roof.
Ah
From two eh, from the bedroom where Carlos was and from another big room we had on the second floor
Aha
it has two rooms at the top of the house, so the ceilings were, they weren't made out of iron but with wood, right, that was done around twenty five years ago, so
Oh.
so, it was rotten and unfortunately, my neighbor's house had passed the ivy to me
Oh wow, so it got everywhere.
it was, yes, that ruined it, I believe that was what ruined the whole
It's possible, my mother-in-law, sure.
all the wood, it got rotten and yes, yes, aha, but thank God, they are working in it, I was getting pretty nervous because of all the noise around me, people welding, hammering, moving laminate around, oh, I can barely stand it now, oh.
and my stomach shrinks, you can't imagine
Don't go out and try to kill everybody, mother-in-law.
It's terrible.
And you have to do it, sure.
And there's lots of dust, because they are filling things so, we have lots of dust and sand, oh my God.
And what are they using over there, are they placing concrete and iron now, mother-in-law?
Oh, yes, they are placing some iron bars
Oh.
and aluminum laminate, right?
Yes.
So, to prevent this from rusting, so that it doesn't get holes, break or, well, we'll see, right?
Yes.
how they do it, but the important thing is that it lasts for another twenty five years.
Sure.
It's true, so
And the other house, what are you doing with it, mother-in-law?
Well, we are leasing it, right?
Yes but how, oh
well I have to make some repairs because they called me a short while ago and they said that the cistern is leaking water.
Oh.
so, oh, that hit me because oh, it's something serious and they have to take the cistern's floor to try and find where the leak is.
Yes, it was the same in Paraguay, if something was wrong with the cistern, they had to break the house floor.
Well yes, it's dangerous that its leaking, it is, I've told them that, they shouldn't fill it till the top, I hope they are doing it, otherwise, the house will fall down.
Yes, because of the water leakage.
well yes, it leaks and not just ours but it can also screw the neighbor's house, the water leakage.
Oh and that's so expensive, right, mother-in-law?
Oh yes, it's expensive, it's huge, we don't know when it started, this man told me that we need to break the floor and then fill it up with sand and while the sand gets settled
Oh fuck.
yes, so, shut up, it's coming from everywhere but what can we do, right?
but when they break the floor they check and make sure that they won't say that it's leaking when it's not, right?
Well, it's sad, they might be opening the water flow and filling the cistner
Oh.
That's sad, I'm telling them not to fill it up till the top but sometimes, people just doesn't understand, right?
Yes.
you tell them things and they don't understand, that like is not theirs, no, they don't think about the danger the things represent.
Sure.
not just for them but for me also, not just for me but for them also, right?
Sure, dimwits.
So, let's see what happens. And how's the weather there.
It's already getting quite cold now.
No, really. And it's raining, no, no
No, it doesn't rain, these last days have been really nice, mother-in-law.
Ah, wow, aha.
At night it's super cold and in the day it's quite nice.
Really, wow, how nice.
Is that this year we still didn't have to be with a jacket and that.
Aha, not yet.
Nothing, that's strange.
Mm, yes, yes. And how's your mom, Cheche.
FIne.
Fine, fine?
There she's calm, she's fine.
The trip to Paraguay did her good, right?
The journey was good for him/her

¿Who?
Elizabeth
Oh, she's gone, well, OK
She's gone, and she's, she moved in with a black guy, she's living with a black guy
No, Cheche, what a bummer, oh no, well
A black guy that looks like a gorilla, a chimp from the zoo
¿Really?, well, if that's what she likes, ¿right?
Wait, don't hang up mother in law, wait a minute, no
¿What do you do, what can you do?, sure, I'm here
No, no, no, just wait until they call
Right. Look at that dumbass, but well, yeah, Claudio must be great
There's nothing written about taste
Right, well, yeah, and Claudio, ¿what's new with him?
Oh, he wants to die
He won't, he hasn't been ill, ¿right?
Yeah, it's just that Claudio went to Chile too, mother in law, because his dad is about to die, he's very delicate
Oh, ¿really?, oh no, hey, it's his dad
Yes, aha, and mom too, they're really old.
Well yes, they're both old, yeah, aye yes, no.  And what call you tell me about Mirella.
She went to Austin yesterday.
Ah, really, she went there.
But I've just been talking for five minutes and you have twenty to talk, they're controlling the minutes.
They scrub it, right.
She went with, she went to Austin and kicks, and, and yeah, but this woman is remarkable.  Mother-in-law
Look Cheche, and how do you see this man.
Really good people, mother-in-law.
Fine, good, ah, aha.
Ah, but you never know.
Well yes, this is the worry, right, like they say in your own country, you just get to know your people, let's not say in these big countries, right, and hopefully no-
But fine, fine, fine, the boy, fine, fine, he seems good.
Ah, apparently he seems good.
Yes, and he cares about her a lot.
Hmmm, hmmm.
He calls her every day --
Aha.
but he, he goes there and stays in a hotel, and he has his house, well.
Ah, hopefully.
Eh, no. Yes that's it, because he is very care-
I hope it's like that.
Yes, no, that's it, mother in law, he's very careful this man, he's very respectful.
Aha, ah.
He even wanted to call us, for her to call us to contact us that she was in the hotel and that afterwards we call him --
Aha.
to his house, to see that we were not lying to him, he says.
oh, God, the devil is wiser for being old than for being the devil --
Eh, but the boy is a very nice person.
Mmm, aha, well I'm very happy, right. Let us hope, right.
And I no. Yes, I'm very happy with that.
And her, how do you see her?
She's getting pretty exited.
Aha.
Yes, because she was already like a mummy, all day locked up here, mother in law.
Yes, let us see how it goes, and with work if --
And in part that he doesn't -- eh?
She's still on the same job.
Yes. Now we're going to move.
Ah, Ah?
We are going to move to another place now.
Don't tell me, to where.
And a little farther from the office where we were at.
Ah, the office.
No, no, no from the house, from the office I mean, aha.
Ah, from the office, mm, okay, aha, yes aha.
Well, mother in law
Farther you say -- Yes, Cheche?
Eh? like some two blocks more.
Ah, well, not too far.
Aha.

Yes, it's that you buy natural trees, right?
Aha.
Aha here in the country is just artificial things, ours is like plastic.
Yes, we also had one like that but it was very big and we had to be putting it away and it would get me angry put the crap in the box all the time.
Okay.
And then, here's your sister, who kicks me, hits me, pulls my hair, this one is a criminal, man.

Shit.
We'll see how she works out for me.
That one is a fierce one.
Well, let us see what happens.
Yes, what you need to do is not to let yourself be manhandled because she's one of the ones that likes to impose her own law, so --
Well, she goes the day that happens --
No, yes, of course.
and that's it.
But she should know from the beginning that --
Ah no, she knows, and if it's like that, she leaves and that's it, that yes --
Sure.

She, yes, it's that she, yes --
the day that I don't like something, she leaves and that's it, yeah, problem solved.

Yes
to where you were, she didn't go there because she had another  job

Oh, yes, she didn't do a shit
She was not good for shit, right
For a shit
Yes, this one at least can cook and is more or less clean, well let's see how she works, oh, remember she told you she didn't wash up or iron
But I told her she had to wash and iron for me, and she told me she would
Oh, well, that's different
After all, she won't have to wash or iron so much
Why not? yes she has to
Well, anyway --
And how did you guys accommodate the day that the kids slept, I was saying who
No, I, they slept here in my bed, I slept upstairs in Samuel's room.
Ah and what
Yes, because you know that I can't sleep like that, uncomfortable.
And the one next to it, what happens, the
Well, that I turned on the air conditioner upstairs and I went upstairs to sleep.
Ah.
And they don't sleep alone, neither of the two.
Sure, sure, no I was telling you the room next to it, Alexandra's room.
What's wrong with the room.
Eh, that you didn't sleep there.
There, why was I going to be hot if there's air conditioning up there.
Ah, because there was no fan, yes, yes, yes, yes, it's true.
Yes, mm.
You didn't have a fan nor anything, sure, ah man, put Ode on to say hi to her for a minute, wait, wait, okay, bye.

How are you, how have you been
What else is new.
Good, and how have you been, good
Here taking advantage of these little calls that they give us, ah --
Ah, yes, sure, but how is that, Chipi, how does it work.
Well, it's that he's doing a --
Mmm, well, aha.
some experiments so, eh --
But --
they do this to, to, to test, you see.
Aha, and, but I was going to tell you, indefinite, I mean, for how long, I mean --
No, no, no. Not that, eh, there are some numbers that are some codes, so they need a certain number of people that speak Spanish, you see.
Mmm, yeah, sure. Ah, I understand now.
So people that are inside --
Mmm.
that known people that speak Spanish, so they give us the indications to make the calls.
Ah yeah, good.
Yes, that's why I take advantage.
Listen, and how have you been.
Ah, fine, thanks God it's not so cold like bitter.
you're still happy, you're still happy
Yes, yes, you know that here it's more or less in January, I think, but it's still not even December --
Yes.
but it's strange because here in November you feel frozen, honey.
Ah.  Ah, well, but that's cool that it's delayed.
But no, sure it's delayed, but Diana said that last year it wasn't so cold either, it doesn't seem that --
Hmm, Hey, your credit cards came, but I don't know what this, I tell you to send them with a lady, with this -- aha.
Elisa, who will come here on the seventeenth and will be here for three weeks --
Hmm.
there, she's the daughter of Alberto Gonzalez Rubio.
Hmm, hmm.
She will be here for a few days.  Alberto Luis knows her --
But do you want, do you want me to send it with her or to send it to you before?
Well, before how.
In DHL or something like that.
Ah well, yes, if there's the possibility, sure.
I think that with DHL nothing happens.
Ah great, perfect, of course, Ode, this --
Ah good, what happened is he told me, so I was waiting to talk to you
No, sure, that's it's and Ma- eh, Diana will send some creams to Maria Esther -
Ah, Mary told me this --
like, like, it's hard for us with Elisa --
Aha.
because she still doesn't go, she has to come here before going --
Hmmm.
but still, but she hasn't told us if they've offered her something, you see.
Aha.
and so the poor thing, I also hear, that she's pretty weighed down, as you can imagine.
Hmmm.
the amount of family she has and takes everywhere --
Sure.
and cousins and cousins, and her mom, and her dad, and --
Ah yeah, sure.
so, she, sweetie, goes like Santa Claus --
Aha.
so to me it's a shame, it's a shame if she doesn't offer -- tells him anything.
Tells him, sure.  Hey and what do you --
But aha, and what.
Hmm, no, no, I sent them to you via DH.
Sure, sure.  What did you learn about Eddie.
Nothing from Eddie, we talked with him one day, he was in Miami, he was good there --
No, you haven't seen him with Rosario or anything.
I called her the other day and she called me the day of my one year wedding anniversary
Aha.
and, and nothing. Fine, she remembered, imagine.
Ah, child, yes.
Yes, I have to go over there to visit Chipi but the truth is I haven't had time for anything.
No, sure, child, I can imagine, you must be so busy. Listen, And Nelda has complied with going to clean the apartment
Yes, yes, but she at least today, she was coming to do your apartment, right.
Ah.
but we preferred for her to do Mary's and to do it here tomorrow.
Ah, sure, sure, sure, no, yes, undeniably, because if Mary is alone
Yes, because we are -- sure.
preferable to organize for her
yes.
sure, and that she cleans and fixes her things.
Yes.
Club or whatever, and we would put the low roof there and everything.
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
You know?  So, I don't know, hopefully he's talked with Daniel and they left it --
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they were the mom's conclusions, eh?
No, so no, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  It doesn't seem like it.
Oh, no, no.  Maybe.  The black one who, are you all well there?
Yes, fine, fine, here, it's calm, you see.
But not Irma.
Yes, well, I suppose.  Yesterday they were here for a while, I was studying and --
What is Irma going to do.  Will she go to Barcelona or?
No, I don't think so.  I don't think she'll go to Barcelona.
No?  The mom will come?
Well, it's possible, yes, well, in theory, once we talked with her, the mom said that she wouldn't go to Caracas in December, but I suppose that if Irma goes, she'll go, you know?
Hmm, hmm, sure.  And Ruba, she's well?
Yes, yes, Ruba's well, these days she called and talked a lot with Irma and she feels well, and well, we're hoping for February, I think.
February already, eh?
Like, since it's gone ahead a bit, no, no, she told me that it got further along a little, Irma, no, because she spoke a little with me too, and told me that hopefully it was at the end of February.
And what is she expecting?
Eh, a boy, yes.
Ah, a boy, well.  Cool.
Yes, okay, awesome.
Has she done the amniocentesis exam, all?
Yes, yes, yes.
Everything fine?
Yes, well, she has to be resting and I mean, yes, sure, she's working but, I mean she has to be calm, yes, yes.
Yes, calm, calm, okay. But, has she done the amniocentesis exam? Everything okay?
Yes, yes, she did it, in Caracas, yes, yes, fine, fine.
Everything fine.
Look, and have you heard anything about Tolosa.
Well, yesterday we spoke with Maitane, because I wanted to know, you know that Isaac Echarte took her a suitcase, right?
To Maitane.
Of, of things, yes.
Aha.
Then yesterday I called, because I need that suitcase, right?
Aha.
Is the, the yellow one, you know.
Yes.
And, and this girl Izascu took them things, see.
Okay.
Then, eh, I told Maitane, to remind her to send me the suitcase.
Sure
Good thin, because no, i thought that i might give the suitcase, look, please tell him/her to give you the suitcase back, to please return the empty suitcase, but hey
Sure
And he/she said, oh, well, don't worry mom, and if you can't, well, you'll send it to me with Amaya, hey, we have no suitcase, you know
Oh, that girl brings nothing but trouble, ¿right'
I hope not, hey, because a very light suitcase, hey, the yellow one
No, and besides, maybe she had one suitcase, this can serve her to, of course
To put it inside, well, i think she'll bring it to me then
Maybe she brought it to you full
Yeah
like, like
She can easily bring it to you empty, ¿right?
Sure, no, with her own stuff
Oh, sure, even better, hey
Sure
Well, i wish
Sure
So, well, about the rest there, Maria is a little bit sad, uh, she hasn't gotten over Ramon
Oh, yes
Because, uh, yeah, that Concha, uh, they've only known each other for six months, and she doesn't know if she married Ramón on purpose, so, anyway
Bah, she shouldn't mess with that, no.
Silly conclusions, no?. Well, I told her to get rid of all that and to think about the kid --
Listen, but --
and that's it, and that well if she doesn't want to get married, that well, they shouldn't marry, yes, to start living together, no? and that's it, that is not
Yes, yes. No, but she doesn't have to think in that if --
Eh, those are idiotic conclusions, listen.
Yes, man.
Now it turns out they have married her son, don't joke. To me --
No, man, no, no. Ramon --
No, Alai told me that if Amaia had been the one with the problem, well then -- There would have been something to be heard, well, that at least it wasn't like that.
Yes, man, sure.
Yes, because that's true, listen, that's true.
Sure, sure, no, no I know, I know that's like that.
Since its Ramon and now it turns out that someone has caught Ramon, imagine yourself.
Yes, poor guy.
Yes, he's caught.
Sure.
He would be in the moon.
Sucking his thumb, no?
Don't joke. Well, and the --
No, also he knew, he knew that, that she wasn't controlling that.
He knew?
Yes, yes, he knew, so there's nothing with that, you understand?
Mmm, don't play around, on top of that. He told you?
No, Amamya, Amaya told us that since, I mean that Amaya told him that to see what had happened, if he wasn't-
Ah, yeah.
and he told her that no, that she had stopped controlling herself, that he knew but --
Ah, look how funny, so why doesn't he say that to his mother.
Well, but, eh? no, what happens is that it seems that it was that -- Well, that he has heard over there that contraceptive pills produce cancer and I don't know --
Ah, poor girl, yeah.
for that mess and it's well --
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
you really are shit, ah? Well, but eh?
Who says that, Irma? Missis Irma says that?
No, no it's that that came up on the news --
Ah, yes?
Yes. What, what you're saying, that you are a shit, no.
Why did you say that.
No, no, I for you, because you say poor girl.
Ah, yeah, yeah, well, well.
Ah?
Oh, that's all over, I don't care anymore--
No, sure, but you, and you are the ones who should stop gossiping, right now
Of course yes, of course yes. Look, you are going on the thirty-first, you
Look, we'll see, we'll see
Listen, Orfilia has been saying that the train of, she is here, she has come for the wedding
Oh, yes. Miquel?
Miquel has married Nicol
Oh, really?
Oh, jerk
Yes, yes, I know who Nicole is
Yes, she has married, in a civil ceremony, because she is Jewish, isn't she?
Oh, I didn't know
Yes, so they have married in a civil ceremony, but a strictly familiar wedding, right?
Just imagine
Yes, and she got married on Tuesday and so have come Begochu, the husband, and  Pili, and today have gone Begochu and the her husband and Pili will stay until Sunday
It's fine
so, Pili was telling us there is a train from Paris, from Paris to Endaya
To Endaya
that is wonderful, it costs --
No, yes we
it's three or four hours.
Yes, well, not that much, not that much, not that
Four hours, he said.
Well, now it's a bit longer, it's the same train that we caught when we went there mom. Yes.
Yes, which one.

TGV, aha, I see.
Yes,.
Grand, aha.
That's right, oh?
I see, I see, I see, and?
No, but that lasts like five hours, eh?
Ah, yes.
Yes, but well, sure, is a
But it's worth it, uh.
No, of course it's worth it, of course it's worth it.
Okay.
But sure, you have to see, right? you have to see, I mean, I, I of course that if, if I see that the days we are going to be in Paris, because now the problem that could arise is that the twenty fourth to the thirty first
Mm.
in Paris I don't know how the work movement will be
Okay, of apartments, okay.
I suppose that a real estate agent must work, right?
Yes, yes, yes. yes.
so
I'm going to tell you something, Paris which is the place of the students from there
Yes.
and that precisely in Christmas there's movement because in January the classes start, there has to be.
Sure, sure, yes, yes.
There has to be, then, listen
Yes.
Yes, Mirencho has controlled himself somewhat, ah, yes.
Today I called Mirencho but I couldn't talk with her because we were outside, like, Irma was --
Hey.  She's nice, no?
Yes, well, it's that, yeah, when we talk, I more or less explained to her, and she said, well, that --
Yeah.
that she would called me, like she asked for my telephone number and I told her something when I had an answer from the people from the IFP --
Yeah.
because I didn't know if they were going to fix the housing so --
Yeah.
but they already told me no, like, and they gave me some numbers to, like some fax numbers for some housing agencies.
Aha.
and I still haven't written to the agencies, because I didn't want to do it too far in advance because then I would forget, no?
Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes.
I'll do it now, this week.
Yeah.
So, they told me to call tomorrow, I didn't call because at that time I had returned --
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
and it was late, like, like I told you, very --
From Paris, yes, yes, yes.
Right, right, it was not.  So, well, I'll talk with her as soon as possible, I don't know if she's been able to get something, I don't know.
Sure, sure.
Or the other way with this, these fax numbers I have, so
Yes, yes, yes, because you all could go, for example, on the 27th
Yeah
to the 1st, just imagine that
Exactly, exactly, depending on how I can arrange
Sure, yes
yes I, whether having arranged something already
Mmmm
or if I see there's no movement and I won't be doing anything those days in Paris
yes
I'll go, I mean we would go
Sure, sure, that's good
do you know what I mean? Well, to ma- eh?
yes, yes, because, you know, Amaya, Amaya's leaving the 26th from
Yes, yes, we know, we talked to Amaya, before she left
I see, yes
and she said that they started their trip on the 26th, but well, if we don't go on twenty- the twenty-four is very difficult for us to leave on, because I'll be arriving there on the 23rd
Sure, yes
the first thing I'll do is, talk with my contact, run these errands, you know
Sure, and Irma arrives on the 23rd
Mm, exactly, then I find it hard for me the twenty fourth, unless it's
You think that Irma will arrive on the twenty third?
because the, the there the
When is Irma leaving Caracas?
The twenty third in the afternoon.
She won't arrive in Paris the twenty third.
No, she arrives the twenty fourth.
She arrives the twenty fourth, mm, mm.
Correct, I know, I know, I arrive the twenty third.
But going faster, not taking the bus now
Faster

Thank you, i was just telling your mom
Right, oh, that's so exciting
And that's it, that's good, and i don't know, you have to move forward, and everything she told me. It was very nice what she said, she didn't reprimand me
The speeches she doesn't give me, she gives to you
¿Huh?
The speeches she's not giving to me, she's giving to you. Oh, I'm glad boy
But yeah, no, i was talking to her, it's just that yesterday they sent me, ¿what's it called?, on Saturday
Uh huh, uh huh
They sent me to meet a person over there, about a conference i have to give there in Chiquimula-
Right

You went to Chiquimula yesterday

That was sudden. Two hours and a half by car
Oh

Yeah, its that, right
Right, I'll tell you tomorrow, well, I'm leaving tomorrow at five and a half or six a.m.
¿Where, where are you going boy?
I'm leaving tomorrow, ¿didn't i tell you?, it's my last trip as
Oh, but, ¿where are you going?
Look, tomorrow I'm visiting Río Hondo, Teculutlán, Tacapas, Chiquimula, Esquipulas
Oh
From there from Esquipulas I return, I go to Hualan, Morales and Sabal, Rio Dulce and Puerto Barrios.
You know what I have a craving for.
I already imagine what.
Of, in, in Sacapa they sell a bread that it's not like that like bread but rather it's like that
Of yolks.
No, no, no. It's not bread, but rather it's ah
Quesadilla?
it's more like it. That, quesadilla.
Rice quesadilla?
No there's of something else.
I took that to your mom, last time.
Ah, yes, she told me of that one, but
Mm, yes, yes, by the way she told me that you loved that.
Yes, I like it.
Aha.
Yes, it's been a while that I don't eat it.
Ah, my love, I'll try to bring some. What happens is that it gets bad.
Yes.
Ah no, when I go from Coban, that day I'm coming in, that day I'll be giving them to you, it's going to fall like that
See, now I don't want country chicken. Ah?
Like everything. Ah, yes.
Now until
Now you don't want chicken, I was going to ask you that, how strange that you've asked me, now if
No, is that last time I ate too much.
Ah. You stayed
Already, I already got full, with the chicken.
Okay, okay queit?. No longer, but good, cutie, that I'm glad that you are fine, you hear?
Ah yes, after I finish talking to you, I have to start studying because tomorrow I have a test.
Mm.
Look, look.
You remember that tomorrow at seven, and your mom says that you told your dad at eight, and today they arrived at seven forty
No.
Saturday, that you had told me, first, at nine, and told me, ah, no, that it's too late, better not, that better if it was, if it was at seven, you said.
AH?
Ah, sorry, that it was better at eight, it's good.
No, because
Then they arrived at eight, seven forty is when your mom was there.
No, the thing was that, that I called, they called to charge to my aunt's house
Aha.
then there it was when I spoke with them and  I only told my mom's husband the time, then I was a little unsure because I know that he forgets things.
Yes, is
Yes I had told him that at eight, ah? and from there I remembered that I can't use the PIN at eight but rather before that time, then I told him better at seven and I even repeated it twice so he would say it aloud so my mom would hear him, but since they were in Huatel, I think, then my mom was outside of the telephone booth or something like that.
Ah, what.
Look, look.
But yes, sweetie, tomorrow they will be here at seven in the morning, you hear?
Ah, well, thanks, tomorrow I'll call them, dear.
Yes, my love, I already told them in case that, they cut off the communication, excuse me?
Yes, well, thanks my love. I miss you a lot.
But, tell me love, me too, but you are coming already, my love, you're coming already, there's very little time left already and there all that. What?
Ten days. There's ten days left.
Yes, sweetie, yes.
Counting the
If you could see, I'm nervous and I don't know why.
How exciting, seeing you again.
But yes. My, my love. Take care there, say hi to me at least, you see.
Yes, yes, it's just that I'm going to arrive, like my grandmother used to say, how I gathered up my clothes
Ah?
in the clothes that I was going to iron, in a jacket, and I did it like that like a bag
AHa.
well then she would tell me, when I had several things like that by my bed, that it looked like, I don't know what, the she-devil, but is that there was a lady in my grandmother's town that had a bunch of bags like that, she was always carrying a bunch of bags
Lady Moncha
I don't know, maybe it's the same lady
Oh, yes, my mom mentioned a lady Moncha, that had only bags
Oh, well, that's what she told me and that's how I'm gonna get there because i have to take the box wuhere I'll be carrying the stereo and the luggage
Oh, ¿do you have to pay for something?
I don't know, i don't know.
Maybe you can't just put it in like several parts, like it was used
What i, i just want to carry the box because, i mean, it's gonna be sold as new, new
But the box doesn't matter, honey
¿It doesn't?
Seriously, you'd know, you'd know better if i told you that it's new, ¿right?
Uh huh, because i thought about that
That you'll stick it... ¿what was that?
What i thought was, i mean, it's a box, so, since i also have to carry clothes that my aunt sent to my brother, i would then put the stereo's box surrounded of my brother's clothes in another box, because ultimately, right
Right, ¿but why?, why not split the speakers if you can
Yeah i can
or the parts, so they will fit, separate them like that in bunches, ¿right?
Right, uh huh
So that if they open that box they'll only see one thing, ¿you see?
Oh, well, right
Yeah, you know, i mean, put it within your clothes, you know what i mean, different parts, that you can
Uh huh, yes, yes, right, well, yes, I'll do that
Yeah, so that they won't charge you a lot, cutie
I wish they don't charge me, because there's supposed to be a limit of about one hundred dollars, two hundred, but i really don't know
No, they shouldn't charge you, they shouldn't, no girl, no, no
I wish, I'll tell them "don't charge me" , and they won't
Yeah, my love, oh, honey, tell me something, quickly, what, ¿what...?
Oh, when i went to California, my aunt took me to Disney
Oh
and also to the Universal studios
Uh huh, you just made me forget what i was going to ask you, to tell me quickly what...
Oh, ok, i saw my dad
No, and you definitely thought about... oh, you got ahead f me, ¿yes?
¿What?, no, you see, i know you so well i can read your mind, hold on
Oh my god, ¿do you know what i was watching today?
Yesh, uh, right
About fifteen, twenty minutes ago, something of yours, white
Right, ¿what color?
White
You're gonna have two to see later
Ah, the boobs! Yes, I was looking, ah, I said, I was looking. Listen, you know like some twenty minutes, like I tell you. Dear!
Ah, talking of something, aha?
well, so yes, tell me, yes, excuse me? well continue, tell me.
No, speaking, speaking of something similar - yesterday in the morning we went out with Quena to buy some things at the supermarket
Yes, mm, yes.
but we went to the capital, ah, I here in the town, then we went to the capital, then, I bought you something, ah?
What did you buy me, what did you buy me.
No but, yes there I'll show it to you. That one is for you, for you, is not mine.
But what, what did you buy me, tell me.
No, it was to leave you with the doubt
Ah, you're horrible.
Ah.
Horrible. You left me with that little thing of what can it be, what can it be, but no
Aha, I'll tell you already when I arrive.
I don't want anything else, just you, that you come
I'll get there already, I'm going to arrive with a ribbon
Really?
As a Christmas gift.
Where's the ribbon going to be if I take it off.
Okay.
Oh, God what does Regina said? Is she going home or somewhere else.
Oh,
What happened?
No, nothing, I mean, she's staying here.
What happened, no, what happened before, you said, oh!
Oh, I mean, we are not, I mean, I was saying that she was my best friend a while ago but now, not that much.
Yes, not that much
I mean, it sounds bad but she let me down, Ii mean, I was hurt because of the way she behaved, I mean, I don't know, I feel like if I tell her that, I did tell her but she didn't care. I told her, I did.
Yes, my love, you told her.
Aha.
Oh God. And now, isn't she talking to you?
I  mean, we do talk but, it's not the same.
It's not, and what about her?
The same thing,
Has she behaved as she used to or has she changed?
She has changed.
Yes, because of that boy she's dating?
I mean, yes, I mean, that's right, I know. And also because-
Is she dating this guy?
Well, one day that guy came over and he called me
But it almost straightened up, and here they will change the piece for him, that's why my mom told me what if we take him to
Listen, the, the defence of the gray one is it still broken?
Yes, it has a little hole there.
Ah, really --
You gave me that one right, the small one.
No, if I am only leaving and I'm in everything. Listen --
What.
well let's see how they do it, but tell Alejandro that he shouldn't spend anything, nothing, nothing over there.
That he doesn't see what.
That he shouldn't spend anything, nothing, nothing.
Nothing, nothing? Why?
No, right now. I will tell you later, I will call you again, just to tell you.
Ah, yes.
And I need eh, for you to get some -- I don't know, two small rolls of gift paper, to wrap.
Ah, OK
I say, that mom doesn't see it
Aha.
That no, well, that no one see it. You get them.
OK.
I say, for when I arrive, no? for the twenty third, twenty fourth.
Yes, well, yes. I mean, I will start buying them right now, so it's not so expensive
That's it, I mean, when you see, when you have the chance to do it without being seen
Aha, that they don't see me, no --
Listen, will you want me to bring you white sheets, to --
White sheets? Oh yes, I'm running out, well I'm not running out but I'm in the last package
Right. Then I'll bring you. What else? Who is bringing the phone?
Me, usually, I mean, when I am here at home I leave it here, right? When Alex is here and I'm staying he takes it, but this week for instance I take it to school
And how do you do it in school
How I do what?
Do you always bring it to chool?
Yes, under my bench, I leave it there, in during the break I keep it in my bag, in my jacket or in the pocket
If you had
Oh, I see, but I have never called you in the middle of a class
No, I told you, if you call you'd better do it around half past eleven. Sometimes, if I have just recharged the battery, I leave it turned on all day long, right? but when I see it is about to finish I only turn it on during the break, because for instance, there is the universal mailbox
Yes
If it was off, out of range or busy --
Aha
to record a message, then they --
But you can'¡t record a message, you can only leave your name.
No, the message --
No, the-
Yes, because I was talking and they give you the instructions and you tape the message.
Oh, well, it's the same.
Yes, I think it first tapes your first name and then you get to choose and then, yes, I then call to see the messages, they let me chose, they tell me, you have this many and you can chose which ones to listen to, I believe by name or something like that.
And oh
because the message that you hear is the one that they charge you.
Oh, they charge you?
The, yes, if you have twenty and you listen to two, they charge you fro those two, I mean, as if you had
They charge you for the time.
Yes, like if you were listening to the call.
But the service, voice mail is is free?
No, it is free. It's universal, there's one that is personal, I mean, I tape my name and everything.
Oh, I see, oh, no.
And I have a password, but what for.
No, nothing, if you already have the one that is universal
Yes, so, David, I mean, in the recess or at the end they call you and they keep on calling until they find you, so they say, well this person called do you want to listen to the message?
Oh well, that's really cool.
Yes, yes, they don't charge for that.
That's cool. Oh, because you turned it off until recess.
Yes, yes.
Because listen, I called, I don't remember like at what time.
Mm.
but it was still school time and I said well who, brings my brother, my mom, I didn't know, well let's see if he's not in class and it sounds in middle of class.
Mm. No well no. And the answering machine didn't answer?
Yes, that thing answered.
Aha and what is
What happens is that I wanted to see how, also the first time that they gave it to me I wanted to know how it was, how you dial from here
Is not, ah.
and, also you left it off, is also another thing.
But, and what
And you dial, you dial the same, just I don't press the nine zero five -- instead of dialing the house telephone number, I dial the telephone number of, anyone's telephone number
Mm.
dial the cellular number, I mean, just from the four.
Aha four hundred, okay. Mm, I didn't know
Yes, normal, I mean, I don't know why but
Ah, listen
Ah.
You didn't call on Monday? You didn't try calling?
I didn't call Monday?
At six, no like at seven thirty in the morning, seven thirty or eight?
There to the house?
No, to the cellular.
I don't think so.
Well, because that day, I had classes with Perez but I hadn't gone and half a class, no, half an hour free and it started ringing, I thought it was my mom but I answered and they hung up.
No, I don't think it was me.
and now neither and I already ask
God knows. What, then you didn't finish telling me about my mom.
Of, ah well, since the car is over there,
Where, over there.
in the shop. They sent me to a shop and I took it there.
Ah, yes. Ah, when do they give it to you.
Most probably tomorrow, tomorrow is Saturday, yes, tomorrow in the, in the, at one or something like that. Tomorrow, today, tomorrow I have to call, ah is not true, Saturday at one.
Mm
Tomorrow I have to call and they'll tell me if it's already fine or not.
Okay.
And
Then you bring Pichirila
Aha, I was bringing Pichirila. But well she went to her guitar class then I didn't know if it had ended or what, that's why I wen to see, otherwise to go for a walk, to Plaza Taxquena to see if she was there.
is that she was in Lilia's house, since I had to study, then I went and returned and was studying then I called her and she already arrived, and that was all.
Well, I didn't understand that last part.
¿From where, from where?
You went to see that, you went to see if he/she wasn't in Plaza Taxqueña
