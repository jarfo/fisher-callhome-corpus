No because I am not taking classes now. That is what I was waiting for, at first I was taking classes in summer, but my economic aid in summer was not very good, then I had to leave the classes because if I didn´t I wouldn´t have enough money to pay Greece.
Aha
Then no, no, I didn´t take more classes and now I cannot go in Spring because if I do I would not finish on time, I would not get graduate on time, Then I was waiting, that was what I was waiting for to know if I were going to Greece or if begin to make plans for going there on Spring and that, but if all of Greece is ready I think that Tomorrow I will go to the office
to see how the documents are and else, what happens is as I have changed house I don´t receive anything and I know nothing.
Hmm.
Then I am going to see how is all the issue, the only thing is missing would be my medical test and have my passport pictures sent, for my passport
Well then make there a, a , a well, a semester and the next semester in the United States --
Yes.
Common and current.
Yes.
Listen, and will you come? --
Oh see how good!
And would you come to Mexico?
Well, I am trying to. That was what I was thinking as I will not go in December, I would like to go on August, but I don't know how much money I will have, I have to find out first how much will my scholarship be
Hmm
to go to Greece --
aha.
if it is enough because the last month in Greece I have to make independent study and they say we have to pay it and then I want to know which scholarship is Penn going to give me, if Penn is going to, going to, pay that for me
Well, I I would like you to investigate well all that economic issue and the stay there and until what date would you be there?
In Greece?
yes, because then we would like a lot to go, to go to Greece
Of course, you know what I was thinking, I think the semester finishes the eighteen or something like that in December.
In December
So, from now to December 10th, I want to travel, that's why I want to have money
Yes. Then we could travel somewhere from the 20th to January 5th
And, and we travel somewhere, of course
Also we should tell Lucy that instead of coming to Mexico
Yes, I think, I would love it, mother. I would love it. That's what I was telling Lucia.
that we go to Greece, sure
Yes I'll go, come on and we travel a little with what we have and she told me yes.
Sure. So, if we go in December, well then it does represents too many expenses, so don't come to, in August.
Yes. That's what I was thinking because I will save a lot of money, , but I want to stay like three, four weeks traveling there, so well I better save.
Right
Well That's what I was thinking. So, tomorrow that I go there I will find out more, I'll talk to them- the problem is that I work full time and I don't have free hours to go out or nothing--
aha
But I'm going to go at lunch time and I'm going to see what, what
Well, I was going to tell you, then I'll call you.
Don't worry, I, I will call you and all that, the same and I'll get them to give me another number so we can talk for free.
And that experiment, what is it about
They are recording. You see that my job is about computers language recognition
Sure, well. Yes
So they have been doing a lot that is of formal language,
Yes
now they want to do it with natural language, they want
Mmm
to understand how it works and the rest. Mmm. That's why they're doing it
Yes I understand now Mmm That's good.
But, but that's how it's all the mess
Your aunt Anita was here over the weekend and we'll probably go to Puebla on Saturday.
Ah, yes? And how are they over there.
Well eh, for whatever is worth, fine. My dad well, he's still in Santa Lucia
Mmm
My mom, over there in Guadalajara
In Guadalajara --
Tilin, they already ran him out of the school
Mmm Oh, really?
he doesn't want to come with me
And why did they run him out of the school --
Well because, he's not interested, he's already very aggressive, etcetera, no?
is he missing a lot? Mmm
So he is here with Chato
Mmm
so I offered him to come, to stay for as long as he wanted, etcetera, and I almost convinced him I thought, and Tuesday I went to fetch him where we had arranged, he didn't show
He didn't show --
Afterwards I worried, I talked to him a couple of times, I can't leave it just like that, can I?
Take it easy, yes, yes, invite him one day for dinner or something like this, let's see what he says
Yes, and besides he told me. Yes, well, he was here for two days and I told him, I'll buy you a sweater and he said, no, I don't like it, I said alright then, a jacket, and he said no, better sneakers, alright then, I'll buy you sneakers
yes aha
I asked him, mm, how much do they cost? and he told me four hundred thousand pesos. No, I said
Oh damn, what did he want?
No, no, no, I said, that I won't buy. Look, choose among those that are reduced, and he told me, I don't like those, alright then, I won't buy them --
No, no, because it is, it is so much money, mom, he has to
No, no, no way, damn no, there's no need, right?
Yes, yes. He's crazy. Four hundred thousand pesos, like they were made of
he's crazy. Yes, crazy, crazy
Not even here they are that expensive
Well, here they are very, very expensive, right? And he told me that, and I said no, Tilin, no
Yes
I told him I don't have the money, and I don't want to do it either
Mmm
and, that's it!
Mmm
but, eh more or less for what it's worth, well we're pulling along, no?
Mmm
Mmm
And, what will you do? If you go to, with Margarita and the rest, to the beach and the rest?
Yes, yes, I'm thinking of going to Veracruz
Aha.
and then, eh, well a few days to Irapuato to heal my teeth
yes
and then to visit my mom. Only that, of course, the thing with Margarita, well she would have to confirm it because eh
Mmm
well her dad, she told me that he's very sick, ninety two years,
well, eh
that they will possibly operate on him and that, so well if maybe in one of those he has problems
Mmm
all that gets cancelled, no?
Mmm, for what date are you thinking about that?
Say?
For which dates?
Around June eighteen. In one month and a half, so so.
Mmm. Well, I'm going to go visit Lucia in Chicago.
Yes, she told me.
I'm going to go see her on June thirty.
Mmm
I'll be there for four days, I'll get back quickly
Oh, that's great
I got a pretty cheap ticket I got one in three hundred dollars, round trip
Oh, that's great
Let me tell you something, I thought it was expensive because I don't have that much money so I told him, do you have a cheaper one, a cheaper one? But, I'll still visit her for a while
Yes, that's great
yes, yes, I'm going to, this will be a vacation for me, I think
That's great Monica.
Hey, did you see the show about Greece? Did you get the brochure?
yes they send you a brochure, but you know that I don't speak English, so I just looked at it
well yes, okay
I just let the others tell me what to do
The others. Yes, but those shows are really good.
So, I did watch it; I was like, oh, great, but I was doubtful about the next semester, where would you be?
I was thinking, I was thinking about staying for a whole year but then, I thought, if I'm going to stay here for a year I have to take summer classes because if I don't, I won't finish on time.
Mmm.
so, I started taking classes but I didn't get, I just had five hundred dollars per class and the class costs around one thousand and two hundred and then, it was a loan, it wasn't even a scholarship, so, I said no, this is useless.
Sure, that's right.
so I quit. I was also worried that if I had to go to Greece, you always get financial support, they pay what you owe, what you owe and then they give you what's left, no? So I was like, I'm going to owe a lot and I won't have enough to
sure, no, well, that's where, I'm going to have to save a lot
No, you must save, fine, and you know what, you should book your flight and then I'll let you know next week, I'll give you the final date and everything
No, but it's useless for me to book it now, mom
It'll be cheaper, mom
No, but not in six months.
No?
And it's not a reservation, you have to pay or they'll increase the price.
No, but I, well, what I do is that for example, I call, I call them and I say that I want a ticket for said date and they give me something really cheap and and then when I have to pay, I call them again and I tell them that I have to change the return date.
No, I did that
so, they keep the same price for a while
I did that, no, they don't save the price for you.
No? They did to me, oh, what a mess.
They don't here. I tried to do that last year when I went to Philadelphia and they ended up charging me a lot.
Oh, really?
That's why I even had to change the airline.
Oh look, mmm
No, mother, not that much. Yes, yes, hat's it, besides, look there is one more thing. The Engineer Efrain travels a lot --
Aha
so he tells me that, that in December the fares are lower
Oh, look, really?
and that, last year for instance, he managed to go to Paris
MM
in a Mexico Paris, and they gave him three days, two nights of hotel
Oh, that's great
so I was thinking of going to Greece, a Mexico Rome
Aha
And see if they give away something for free, and then continue to wherever you go
That would be the point, no, I don't think I will have a place to live in, so the most safe would be a motel or something
Yes, or we could sleep in the train, couldn't we?
Yes, that too, that's what I was thinking of, but to start my stay in Greece, I think it's like that, I think I'll live for a while with a family and the rest, when we go to other cities, we live in motels and so
Well, but look, you could make it with families and we pay them, cheaper, and by that time you make an idea of how much hotels cost
Mmm
and well, we could pay them cheaper
I will stay in those that are the cheapest ones you can find, all those who go on, you know, who go on travel they go there
Mmm, mmmm, well
So, that's it more or less, for you to think about --
Yeah, yeah, yeah a thing like that, very cheap.
Okay, well to
I think it was the fifteen minutes, right?
Well no they don't say anything, well let's continue the same is half an hour
No because maybe they charge you, goodness.
Ah no, no, no because the people have entered only yes, two other calls, and both were cut off, one at fourteen minutes and the other at eleven and something
it gets cut off Ah Okay
then they wanted to see, especially want to see why the calls are being cut off and why because I tried to call first before and the call didn't go through
Mm
and it was because I wasn't dialing a number and
well you already had me worried, I called you
Yes, I got your message but really I didn't see much point in calling you since I didn't even have a phone
Ah
nor did I know when I was moving. It was a hassle to move
Mm
there were problems with the, with the owners of the apartment and well Bobby is in Chile, so I had to call him in Chile and from Chile they had to send a letter
Mm
Pay extra, no, no, it was a hassle, until until the mere day the same day that I moved at night was when I found out that I could already move
How horrible
then, there you have me moving at night, just furniture here, the guys that were living here still were not leaving, no, no, it was a hassle, then I didn't know what I was going to do I said, what case
Mm and now what are you going to the with the furniture if you leave?
Oh. Yes.
Look, I spoke to him, I think it was the day before yesterday, Christian called me through this same system
Yes.
so, I told him that Eddie was here and that I liked him so much, that he was honest and responsible, so he told me that all the Morellis are like that, Chela, Orlando and Myriam, they are all like that
They are all kind and responsible.
Oh.
He has a good opinion of you.
Look, yes, but, oh, Christian called me and he told me that you had spoken to him but that he was, it seemed to me that he was a bit angry because you would speak a lot about Eddie, oh?
Bah!
I think that he was a bit jealous, that he was taking your love from him
jealous, no? No, no, no.
it's just that-
I have a big heart, I can love lots of people.
Sure, well, sure. I was happy because he's coming to see you and all of that, that he's visiting my parents, all of that because
Sure. He's not coming this Monday because I think they were having a football match or something like that.
Yes.
And and, then, the other day, they also had a meeting, a Mormon meeting so he didn't talk, he said they had said a lot of stupid things and that was all. He was going to go sing to another
Oh.
one that is Peruvian, his mother is Peruvian and he is American.
Oh.
and he speaks Spanish really bad, awful
Oh
But you see, he has a little face like those poor Chilean children, like that
¿Yeah?
Tiny, black and all that, and when i hear him talk like that, so hard, i laughed and said "¿why does that kid speak like that?", "because he's american", he/she said
Hey, but Eddie has progressed a lot in his Spanish and he know a lot of
I can imagine, i
lots of young people's words, hey, it's so funny
Oh, that's hilarious
Because one day i was telling you that now that you sent him one hundred dollars, he was going to be a multi-mullionaire, and he said "¿where did you saw that one?"
that "¿where did you saw that one?" means where do you get that from
Oh
and he has lots of terms like that, he loves to say "yeah you", "no you"
Oh
and he's so funny, hey
Yes
But he looks very different than the pictures you sent us
¿Yeah?
because he's got short hair, but yeah
Sure, sure, that's why
Super short, and plus on top of that it seems Mondays he always cuts his hair
Ah.
He says like that is more comfortable. He has his hair really short.
What a thing
But I get the impression that there they like him a lot, listen.
Ah, really?
Yes. And he has, some friends and look that I told him the other day that I had an apartment in Vina, then he told me, but I like it a lot, Chely, the fact that he's so spontaneous, he told me, we can go in the summer there,
the year when I can go. Okay so, I told him, come on, but you have to say it seriously, well Eddie, not, not just like that. Because then I thought that I could invite
a grandson of Arnoldo, Do you remember Arnoldo, our cousin?
Yes.
Who died.
Yes. Ah.
Well Anyway that guy is a delightful guy
Ah.
very gentlemanly, very, look he's a guy very and also he has, a virtue, that he has a car. And he's one of those guys that are hard to find in Chile that are, that work in the day in a bank and at night study, in the afternoon study
that thing like accounting, I don't know what it is he studies
Okay
and he has a car then I thought, he was going to have someone more or less around his age, so listen.
Sure.
and, then, I told him, to ask, because he has to ask the president
Ah.
if maybe, the president of the Mormons
Yes.
if maybe they would pay his return ticket if he left at a later time, because he wanted to stay three more months here, then he, each time I tell him, listen well - listen so Eddie, and you asked.
No, I haven't asked because I haven't seen him. There's still a lot of time left. No but Eddie is that I have to get the things in order, because I have to tell this kid if he wants to spend the summer vacation with us
but I think that this kid would like it because he's very affectionate with us,
Yes.
this kid whose name is Carlos Ortiz
Yes.
and then well there, plus on top of that we would have a car and we could get to know a lot of things, from there, so listen, isn't it true?
Possibly no. No, I don't think they'll give him permission. Ah. I don't think they'll give him permission.
Ah
And like that, to stay for so much time, neither. Ah.
But he would just stay a month,
Possibly, it could be a week, or two weeks or something like that, perhaps, ah
Mm But
But, I don't think so.
Ah, I hope they give him, so
because they have to fulfill a, have to fulfill a period and that's all, it's all very planned, you understand me, Graciela?
Mm.
because when he, he already finishes, another one will go in his place, Ah?
Ah.
So no
Well, but the thing is that's what he wants, not continue as a missionary, but rather what he wants is for them to simply pay him
the ticket after, the same ticket they were going to pay the previous year, that's what he wants.
As, you say, not continue as a missionary.
No well, in other words
When he, when he already finishes his period, you say
That.
And then, stay some time, stay some extra time, you say
Then sure, stay some extra time. The only thing he cares about is that they pay his ticket
Sure.
then he has to consult if they pay the ticket or not. I find they wouldn't lose anything if they paid him the ticket, so listen.
Sure. But no I don't think so, look, I don't think that
I hope it works out for him.
I don't think that they
He seems to have certain ideas, look. And at this time the house is, the apartment is rented and also, at this time over there it usually rains, and it's cold there's been earthquakes and all those things
Sure Yes
so no, it's not worth it.
And why is he thinking of staying there longer, to be able to know, or why does he say?
It sees that this is what he wants, ah.
Ah.  To know.  To take a walk around.
Ah
Yes
Sure, because look, hey, he comes Mondays in the morning, goes to where Raul needs to spend a little time, comes here, where he also needs to spend a little time because we're a bit more cheerful so
that there, well, and the poor things are so, so downcast always --
Yes.
hmm.  And so, believe me, the best would be to take a little trip.  Hopefully, Raulito can invite him, so they go on a trip, they go, last year they went to the south, to a lot of lakes and things, so it's nice, so --
Sure.  Sure.
And the only thing they would have to do is pay for the ticket, that's it --
Sure.  Maybe, well, hopefully --
How much is the trip from here to there, hey?
Like twelve hundred dollars, it would be, more or less --
Ah, I don't know what this would be in Chilean money.  An, but this has to be a lot in Chilean money.
It is.  Hey --
Hey, but tell me about you
Eh, about me?
Hmmm
Ah, here I am.  About me or Myriam?
About you.
Mm. Look. Always taking care of the children.
You have them there?
Ah?
Do you have them there?
Yes, they are here now. They are eating, that's right Myriam is giving them the food, because at six they are leaving Over there it's going to be seven, here it's going to be six, now at this moment
Ah. Yes.
So, they are there eating. And, and well, I always take care of the two brothers that I took care of before
Mm.
but the oldest one goes to school already, so he only comes in the afternoon, just for a while.
Ah,
and so I take care of the little one
And the other that has the name Calem, I don't know what he's called
Kelor, ah, that one is a boy who's going to be a year old, and
Mm Oh, he's very little.
He's going to be one on Saturday, and and now the mom then it's going to adopt another baby, his brother, so to speak
Ah,
who's going to be born now. Who's going to be born now next week then the lady is going to adopt him also, so they are going to be brothers, so to speak, real ones
Mm. This one is adopted, also?
Yes, he's adopted, Keylor is adopted
Mm. Ah
Eh, it's a young couple, good, good I said, listen, they are very good looking
Ah
and the, the little boy is very dark-skinned, I think he has a mix like that like Iranian, or something like that, ah?
Ah well, but how are you, Chely, your health?
So-So, look, there are days that I'm better, same as always
but what is it that's hurting you, what's wrong
but always, always taking the pile of medicine, yes no, no
Ah
is that the pains are permanent, you understand me, they don't disappear, then the only way is is
Ah but not as intense as before
Sure, having them quiet like that, let's say, bearable is taking a bunch of medicine that I have to take every day, mm
mm What a shame, ah
yes, well
but it's better you take that and that you don't get that horrible pain, so listen
Yes of course, of course, so like that
Listen, how's Claudio
Look, he's fine yesterday, today
he's very Mormon
yes, now yes. They went into the church a while ago
Mm He was telling Raul that he was happy
Yes, they love it listen, the church, is that the is that look
How nice
the people here, of the one we go to, are all very refined people, Graciela
Ah, how nice
and not only very educated, but also that they are very good people
Ah
they are people so united, helpful, they help you, I don't know, everybody is concerned about the others,if the others are sick, we have a committee that takes them food, to all the ladies that have babies
we take them food so they don't have to be worried- you see that here there are no maids, so Graciela
Sure
then one, look everybody helps each other, it's so nice,listen
How nice that you are into that, Chely
it's so nice that then
Sure, and Claudio then has changed also then
A lot, well, they've all changed. They still have a long way to go, but they've changed, you see
Sure How nice
They don't see life anymore from the dollar sign like they used to before, ah?
Ah
Yes, well, thirty years ago.
Yes well, okay? So, look, in reality, it's hard, you see, specially when you are uncertain and you don't know what will happen you
Hey, you are looking for something and in the meantime
Yes, sure, everywhere. Look, I don't even look at the legal aspect, I look at everything.
Sure.
Do you understand? Blah, the issue, well, oh, the years go by and they don't want older people, they want young eighteen or twenty year old girls.
That's crazy. You know, that happens here too. Look, they place adverts saying that they are hiring an accountant with experience and it should me only thirty five years old.
Sure. That's prohibited here. That's discrimination.
Sure.
Age discrimination is a fact, do you understand?
Sure. Sure.
Oh, so, that's a problem because you have the experience and knowledge and everything but you don't have a nice body.
Hey, and what about those classes that you used to teach Margarita?
Look Graciela, I've tried, it hasn't worked out. I don't have, I really don't have a place to teach because
No, but where you used to work, do you remember, at the university?
Yes but that is over, hey, the courses plans changed and so that's gone too.
Oh, oh.
Look, I do try hard, you know, I work hard. Now
Mmm.
Well, Candice is also now living with me.
Yes, that I know
I see, and --
And how do you see Candice at school?
Fine. She's doing fine. She had bad qualifications in the beginning and then she changed, she improved a lot, but of course, the average was not as high as she wanted, you know what I mean?
Oh, but the year is over
Sure. The school year is over. So --
Listen, and what course will she do next?
Eighth
Ohh
I don't know there --
And it is twelve years
Sure
And, how old is she?
She'll be thirteen - Well, tomorrow is Sandy's birthday
Tomorrow?
she'll be nineteen --
Wow
And Candice will be thirteen on July the twenty-eighth
Thirteen
Yes
Hey, she most live a lovely girl, I think.
Yes, she has
But lovely, she looked like that when she was little.
I see, but
Hey and
Look Graciela, I know that you speak to Chris and I believe that Chris is telling you horrible things, lots of horrible things have happened here
No, no, no.
It's
No, look, we talk about each other only.
I see. For some reason he said that he has told you, I don't know what, so it turns out that he has this nasty attitude towards myself and I take care of the daughter but it turns out that I'm like that, do you understand?
Mmm
it's a really sad situation for me, did you see
Mmm.
But, oh well, The girl is fine, the girl has changed a lot. When Chris was with her she was sad, she was rebellious. She didn't get along with Anissa.
Mmm.
oh, but she's fine here
Mmm.
Do you understand? sure, she gets mad sometimes and I have to reprimand her I have to tell her no, I won't tolerate this but she's happy. I, I asked her if she wanted to go with her mom or dad and she said, no, she wanted to stay with me forever.
Oh.
Poor baby, I felt weird.
Mmm.
And she sees that I, well what I can do for her, if I can't, I can't, I just can't but, but
Sure, sure she has to get used to that, she has, hey. One can't have a fabulous life as to give her whatever she wants, hey, isn't it true?
Yes well, but in any case, the girl is fine. She went to, well she just returned from Austin, she went there with Chris
Oh
because Chris had to go there for her work
She did?
and she took her with her, for three days. She was so happy, she enjoyed the hotel pools and what do I know! She spent some time with her dad, in peace, do you understand?
Mmm.
and now, when she came back, Sandy asked me to go look for her at her job and so I did and I brought her here and it turns out that she invited Candice to spend the night here at her apartment, and so, I'll go to say  hi to Sandy tomorrow, I'll bring her here.
Hey, and how is Sandy? How is she doing in school?
Look, Sandy is not doing fine, Graciela
She is not?
It turns out this girl left home because one of her classmates convinced her to go live together
Mmm
and then this girl she just left
Mmm
and she even took the money that she had given her for the rent
Mmm.
so this girl wasted it on drugs, you see
Oh.
Anyway, that when Sandy discovered that, well no, listen, already this girl told her that well, if she didn't like it, she would leave, so she left
Mm.
and Sandy stayed, there cleaned out, because it's super far where she lives, she doesn't even have transportation nor anything, so
Oh.
she had to withdraw from, from the classes, and to go to work she has huge problems, but now at the end of June, she's going to move again to live with her mom
Mm. Ah.
at least, at least temporarily until she sees how she can manage, because also
Listen and
she doesn't have a car, so listen, and in this city without a car you don't do anything, Graciela.
Sure, sure.
Okay, so that's the general situation of Sandy. Already now that she's coming with her mom, despite the fact she has a lot of problems there, she's more peaceful.
Mm.
Okay, is that, well.
Listen and the money she makes it's not enough to rent a one bedroom apartment, for example.
Is that the problem is that what Sandy earns is nothing. Understand?
Ah. And what does she work in, listen.
She works there in those stores there in the, well listen.
Ah.
Because what she has to do is study, understand?
Hmmm.
but, so, to study, you have to have a schedule, esp- and in the shops, these take on really young girls, for a few hours, that's it, so if you're working --
it's not enough hours and they don't raise at all.
Sure, and besides, well, if you're studying theater you have to read a lot, hey.
Sure.  You have to read, you have to go to auditions at crazy hours and everything.
Sure, sure.
So it's, well, hey, ah --
Well, but for you, how do you feel?
About what.
You know, in your soul.
Well.  Look, with Candice I cheered up a little, because this girl really filled up all the spaces where I was worried.
It seems like she's really alive, ahhhh.
No.  Above all at her age she's really active, well I, in reality, I get tired, you see?  But she doesn't give me time, so I'm left with time to start to get worried.
Hmm.  Hmm.
You know?  But --
Yes.
look, Graciela, I'm confident that I'll find something, in reality I don't know what the devil, but I'm sure I'll find something.  You know?
Hmm.  Over there they need bilingual people, maybe you --
Yes, but they don't pay anything, and then --
Ah.
you are going, you are going to interviews Graciela, you are doing lots of things, you spent money in the trip, you stop working for a few hours and then it turns out that they won't hire you because
Mmm
they don't tell you, that you are not that young but that they just decided to hire someone else and that's it. That's it, nothing else.
Sure. Mmm, that's so bad, that's a pity, hey.
Do you understand? yes, yes, hey, I don't want to, before the time is up, leave without speaking to the child, too, oh?

I see, hey Graciela I don't know how long we've been talking but I think that we don't
We have a lot of time, a lot of time.
We do? Okay then, in total
And they let you know one minute before the time is up.
Yes, well, yes. Yes, I already knew that.
Mmm, give the girls a huge kiss from me and to Candice and Sandy and and, mostly to you, be well Margarita, cheer up and be well, I hope you are happy

Hello, Margarita.

Hello, hello what a pleasure talking with you.
Yes, well, imagine.

Yes, well, it has never been too good, really. Right?
Yes, listen Nena, it's going to be your birthday --
Yes.
unfortunately,  I sent you a card today but you'll get it after your birthday.
Oh, yes. Oh, thank you.
Look, the card is not that beautiful but I chose it because it included one poem that I really liked.
Yes
It's, it's impressive how it happens. And the other one too, but it happens more to Juan and Enrique, and Magali, she has grown a lot, believe it or not, you don't know how big she is
She's taller, Maribi
Taller and she
¿And was Sonia there?
Yes, Sonia and her husband, Juan Manuel, and Sarita, we went with them later, Sarita came to pick me up
¿Yeah?
We all left with them, and then Chocho brought us
Oh
Oh my god, sneezing every once in a while, if this goes public, this communication, they're gonna have a laugh... ¿And how's everything there?
Fine, everything's quiet, dude
Paraguayan viruses
Dude, and mom, Maribi
And mom called me yesterday, she's coming on, she'll be here on the seventeen
And what will she do in Asunción now?
Here no-
Right
And she's going to be with me only, Chicho, and on the twenty three, she's going to Iguazú
Oh, she's leaving to Iguazu
She's going with Ticona to meet Wilda
What type of quality, man.
Yes. They are going to find it there.
And, how is Ticona?
Fine, we are all fine. Hey, look, Silvia called me.
Yes.
I don't know, I don't know, I wasn't. I left to take gorda to the doctor but, I don't know if he called from Concepcion or from here. I don't know if he came because of his surgery, I have no idea.
Who is having a surgery?
Cristina is having a surgery?
What for?
From the, the-
The brain-
goiter, you know, you know, they are operating because she has a lot of nodules.
Yes.
It's serious, what they are doing to her.
Oh, really?
The surgery is important, pretty serious, we don't know if the nodules are benign or not, they are removing them but that is secondary to the surgery, it really is complicated and dangerous.
Who said that?
she's, oh?
Who said that?
The doctor did.
Oh, yes?
Yes, the doctor told Julio that --
And Guido always calls his mom or not?
I don't know.  We went the day that we arrived there, we went to see Guido.
Ah, you went to see him.
Yes, we went.
And how was he?
He was nice.  He had a bed that reminded us of grandma.  He was the same as --
Iti.
grandma, huh?
He looked like Iti.
like Iti, identical to Iti.  And she looked like Dona Matute.
Ah.
She will be gigantic.  And that's it.
And did Che solve his problem?
Yes.  He's a millionaire, again.
He has a lot of money --
According to him.  Yes, he says so.
That's what Guido told me --
Hmm.
That's what Chiote told me.
They have like a hundred... That's what he says, ¿right?, i don't know, Cheché, but they, well, it's a bottomless barrel. they said they charged a lot of money, but
Oh
At the rate they're keeping and they have
Oh, he's all crazy again
Yes, yes, then he stays, he's after his daughter all day, with Loy, you see, they go from here to there
Right
And he said, he told us that he was going to rent her an apartment because she can't live with the married ones, too much trouble, so she's gonna be with the, right there, at the apartment he's gonna rent
¿Can you imagine?, everything, speculating is everything, like the movies
Uh huhu, dude, and Agarrapin
Agarrapo is fine. And Raul is also doing super fine too
¿And Chiotito?
Fine, Choite is the manager
¿What, what is Chiote there Maribi?
Family Manager
¿does he work with Raúl or?
He's in... of course, he works with Raúl
But he's an investor, ¿isn't he?
They're partners. Sure, he's Raul's partner
Oh, partner
Yeah, of course, commercial associate. They're fine, they're really fine. They're selling like it's water, Cheche
¿Yeah?
It's wonderful, so everyone's really fine. Yeah, but it's time limited
Yeah, well, it's like twenty minutes, more or less
Oh, spectacular, ¿and how's the fatty?
Fine, they're at home
I spoke to her the other day, she called me
¿What?, ¿and what does mom say, Maribi?
She's very... nothing, she's fine, i heard her really well, mom. Those days i was with her, there were days where she didn't feel too god
And she's
but know she told me she's really fine, i think it was because of the long trip, after all, she was only for eight days here, and then she traveled again, in a very
And, ¿how did she traveled, on Tam?
We left on Tam, but it was a lot of movement
¿What kind of planes does Tam have now, Maribi?
The same as always, the ones from World War Two
Oh, the same as always... yeah, well, those are the safest
Yeah, always those. We traveled nice, we got there fast
In a cargo plane
¿Huh?, no, no, no, I'm telling you they're nice. I don't know why the Indians here don't do a report about the planes
But you know, they've never had an accident, ¿right?, no deaths
They never had. No, never.
Never.
One time only an old lay died, she died from the fright, not from the accident.
Ah.
The only time.
And it's that they were bringing
Super safe.
they were bringing her hanging there like meat, the poor lady.
No. But good. No, these in which we went are like that, are normal seats. Nice. Super good. Chicho, and you know who died?
Ah?
You remember Jimenez Silva from the Nation Bank of Argentina?
Jimenez Silva, Jimenez Silva, the one from
That tall, dark-skinned, with mustache
Now way, tall, bald head
He didn't die. His son, Anibal's friend, Sunday, an accident here, Concepcion city, he was already arriving to Concepcion, from Pedro Juan, near Ticona
No way
I don't know what broke on the bus and it overturned, Chiote, and they guy was thrown out, and on top of that the bus fell on top of him and destroyed him
and the guard came shooting out the door and with the force the pressure closed it and destroyed him. And to another man, it crushed him. All three died. And his wife has, I mean, they had, have a one and a half year old baby, I don't know what, and the wife is five months pregnant. She's twenty three
Poor
and he was twenty eight. Yes a little, Chiote, eh Checho. Look terrible, he says was the funeral.
And ¿how's Carlos Anibal, Maribi?
Fine, it's wonderful, Cheché. He's really fine. He works very well, he's a faculty teacher and all, he's really, really good
And ¿the elbow?
¿Huh?, ¿the elbow?, hard as always
Plenty, you mean
¿Huh?
Plenty, they say
The chorus-
The elbow
Elbow, yeah, pure, every bottle of beer, bore or less every time that, no more
Yeah, right
stingy, a little bit stingy, a little.
You don't, no, I'm talking about the other thing, the booze, the drinking
Oh, no, sorry, the drinking
Uh
No, um, gosh, i lied
It works with alcohol, they told me, Chiot-
Bollocks, it's not true, that problem was a one time, nothing more. In Christmas and New Year, well, it's a lie, nothing like that. It's not true.
I thought it was odd that this
No, it's a lie. Your brother told you that, you say
Ah
No, he's sometimes kind of imaginative, eh, Cheche -- Not everything is true. No, nothing like that. No, he works like crazy, he just comes ten days a month, only to the city.
He gives his classes in the
Ah. And then there he drinks his beers, poor him.
No, no, no, no, he was already six days now - and he always comes here to the house, never - I don't tell you, that he might drink a can or two, like that how anyone drinks
Like that how we used to drink
Oh,no. Yes, Like that how we used to drink. But no, not true. Oh, he is a professional
Girl, I've been four years already without drinking
You don't say, not even a drop, then
Nothing, nothing.
You don't say.
Nothing, nothing. If I drink one drop, I want to drink three drops, and I go drop by drop.
That. That's what happens. And you don't smoke anymore Chicho
Yes I smoke, again.
You smoke, again.
Yeah, uh huh
You don't say, i can't quit smoking, I'm gonna try
Yeah, it's just that, three years ago, every day at eight o' clock, i had my first coffee
You don't say
Yeah, and it goes on
Don't tell me that you drank, you also drank, i mean
Yes
Plenty
Yeah, by twelve I'd already had a dozen, easily
Oh, damn, that's horrible, dude, you're crazy, i didn't know that, because when i was there, you didn't drink like that, Chicho
no
Or at least i never noticed. Damn, and Santi, the same
Dude, once i forgot the street was over, that i had to turn right and i kept going forward
What
And i woke up in a paddock
¿what?. No, but, what the hell, so, well, dude you just drank on weekends?
Oh, no
Don't tell me it was that bad, ¿and you never drank again dude?
No
That's lucky, Chicho, but that was too far
Supposedly, there is lots of cattle over there but I didn't see any
Oh, really?
who knows where they were
Who knows
maybe they are far away from the freeway or something.
Yes, and they didn't even say which type of animals they were,  maybe they are moles or
Yes, no, cattle, no, no, no, it was cool, we went to Yosemite, to Yosemite
Mmm
No, it was really cool
Do they have mountains? No, the park, it's a National Park, isn't it? A natural park
Yes, yes, it is a National Park and it does have mountains, they are not that tall but they are impressive, quite cool. Huge, most of their slopes are vertical and made out of just stones
Yes, they are famous
And they  have lots of waterfalls, no man, you start drooling
Oh
I was drooling.
Yes, I can see that.
Really
I can see that, I do, I do.
Yes, it was so cool, so cool.
And I was here all sick, my daughter
No, man, and what for.
For the envy that you give me.
Aye.  And where did you get it, or what
Oye, I don't know, I recently had a pimple on the groin, I said, ugh, aye aye, this won't be anything -- and so, nothing, and for two days I was filled with the same everywhere, the face, the head.
Yikes, yes, well, yes
on the strangest places of my body, things that you never see except in the diagrams in the text books, there would be a pimple there, here, it's scary
Yes.  Aye, how crazy.
Scary, scary.
But, you went to the doctor already and everything?
I already went to the doctor and I'm fine --
They diagnosed you.
Well.  I'm full of pimples everywhere but I feel fine, like you can here, more or less.  Yes, I was really bad, man, no.
No, well yes.
Right now, no.
Hey, and, quarantine?
Yes.
Aye, yikes.
And on vacation, going out--
Well, but maybe on vacation.
No, man, this teacher, I had to go and take my last exam here.
¿really?
Yes, i said, I'm saved, because she's also my friend, she's a girl my age, ¿right?, she's twenty five years old
Right
So i told her, ¿you know what, teacher?, I'm very sick, she told me "i don't care, i'm going to apply the exam to you on monday", and i said ¿what's going on?
Whoa
¿Right?, she's gonna come, and when she sees me, oh no, she did it orally
Oh
Orally, and then she made me write some stuff, but i did fine, i mean, i said "she didn't, she didn't forgive me, she's evil", and she's my friend...
Oh, i think she wanted to know where you lived, so
Oh yeah, dude, if you met her, she's so hot
¿Yeah, really?
Yeah, really hot, she's going to England, by the way
Oh, then she's good for you
Yeah, she's going to the University of Wales, on the South, where Sarucán studied
¿To do what?
Uh, ecology, but she does shrimp ecology
Oh
And Sarucán did plant ecology
Uh huh
¿What do you think?, I'm not, i'm not at that lab anymore
yes, yes I got that letter that already the laboratory mother.
Yes, it already counted.
Yes, and that
I was quite upset. Well I don't know.
And then. But how are you going to do the thesis, now, then.
Well, I'm going to do it I think, in the Center of Ecology
Aha
But, first I finish
First you finish the subjects
I'm going to finish this semester, really I'm not behind. I also already finish the program,, this semester. I already finish and the rest. I'm going to devote myself to just study like any other decent human being-
Well. Yes, that's good, right? It's been a grind, a time of
Oh. Well yes. And your sister?
My sister is fine. No, man, what do I tell you about my sister, well you haven't read, that's why you don't know
No
My sister requested an archeology and anthropology program in Greece.
Mm.
And they give it to her!
Seriously?
Yes.
A friend requested something like that in Austria, like that just pure fluke, and they give it to her
Ah, really?
No, no, not even she could believe it, nor her dad, nor her thesis adviser, no, no , no one could believe it and making a contribution so she would leave and she left.
She went to Vienna and
So yes. And so my sister, will leave in September, to Greece
How cool.
No man, they are going to tra- She arrives in Athens and will be there three weeks and later they will be taking her around from island to island and who knows what else, no man, it's awesome.
Ah,great,right.
Yes, it's very nice.
And Greece, right. Did you see the Mediterranean?
Yes.
Uh. After that don't you feel like getting to know
Nothing
Greece. Great
Nothing. Me, here, alone.
Listen, what are you into, and what are you doing this summer
No, man. So they have me here, I'm working.
Really? Right there at the university?
Yes.Yes. I am working for a friend, one one of the teachers
A estranomonte?, right?
Yes,eh. And so, to study, because I have the exam in September-the exam to be accepted
Tutorial, no?
No, well, yes, if they accept me into the doctorate program.  What do they call it?
Here they call it tutorial.
Yes, well, it must be this.
They are, they are the tutorials.  You have to take one each year.
Ah, no, this is only one
No?
At the end of your first year.
Ah, yeah.
and you take it and if you pass it, yeah.
Aye, yes, yes, yes, there's one here too.  And there's a similar doctorate here.
Yes?
The doctorate in the Center of Ecology.  Yes, it's the first five years doctorate.
Hmmm.
So.  And you also get in right away, you don't do a thesis, you don't do
Ah no, here here do a thesis and everything.
No, here you have to make three publications in an international arbitration journal --
Hmm.  Well here
that coincide with-
Well here your thesis has to be published.
Yes, also?
Mmm
Yes, but you're improving,
It's alright, it's alright
It's fine, also
Yes, well. So, I'm saving. I buy nothing, at all, because I want to go to visit my sister, because she is staying
in Greece? Seriously?
Yes, she is going to Greece and then she'll stay for the last three weeks -- three, three more weeks, she just stays and walk there --
But, isn't it very expensive? I mean, the plane
I don't know. Let's see, it's alright to me. I'll save and that's all. Listen, I have never been to Europe, Chesno
Ches. Me either. I'd love to go
Yes, of course
Look, three frinds of mine went now, three frineds, and then a lot of friends
Mmm
went last summer to Europe
Oh, that's cool
Yes, I was green with envy
Yes. Jealousy won't est me up anymore because I'm going there. I made my mind up
Me, definitely next year, no matter what happens I will go there
Otherwise, at least come here
Yes, yes I have thought
no, are you joking, listen to me.
Yes, I am going, I am going. Don't worry. But you have to stay for the doctorate, if not, what am I going to go there
Oh, yes, damn. Hmm.
Ah. You have to stay-
And if I fail, what do I do
Well I don´t know. Work as a translator, or sell tacos, or something like that right? or traffic with tortillas --
Trafficking. No, man, here everybody sells tortillas.
Yes, yes, Chicano. I have an aunt over there, but my mom never, she lost her phone and never knew of her, what she sold, she has weird cheap kitchens and she lived from that.
Well, yes.
All her family lived of that, my child. I think she was a good cooker
No, no, I won't die of hunger. But I want to be an astrophysics
Yes, Not of being a tortilla seller, eh?
Well, who knows, maybe I like it and stay as a tortilla seller.
Yes
It would be good, right?
I know, it is a serious thing, a doctor who made his doctorate in Japan, he finished and did not found a job, and started to sell tortillas and he is the one who sells tortillas in the Asian market of
tortillas to Central America embassies , Mexican
Good, good.
And earn good money.
Oh dear
A scholarship from Conocit
Wow

But, but, but well, i hope i don't get too much marks there
Hey, let's see, hold on a little bit, i think there's another call coming
Wow, it's a research system
Hello
Okay What happened
Okay. It was my aunt
Ah
that I had to call her on the phone and, she called me first
Ah, okay. You want us to hang up?
Well, no, no, no, no well until we finish, lest they hang up on me here
Ah, yes
They are recording us, you don't see that they are recording us?
Ah, yes is true and how many minutes have we been talking
Ah, well I don't know
and, what they don't notify you?
I didn't count Well what I'm thinking. You think like fifteen?
Well I don't know we've been like fifteen minutes, mom? says more or less
Yes, maybe. Let's try another five and if they hang up, well okay
if not, they charge you
and if they don't hang us up, well better for us to hang up
and the whole summer paying the call, eh
good, all
good, all
yes, yes we have to write each other because yes, I miss
yes, yes, yes because this of the mail is an awful vice, it's very bad
So
the email
Why
Because you stop writing the people and also don't save the letters
Yes, that's the bad thing, that the email you don't write, you feel that you write but you don't write as much as a normal letter
also
also no
you don't think as much, I mean, you go improvising a little, right
Yes It's more, more automatic
what are good, and I don't know how to use it, are the links to be like that talking
Aha
those are good
Yes, that you have to, listen but you can print, print the letters
yes, but is that look in Science, my mail doesn't do the mail of the Institute, of course, doesn't do the mail of Science
Aha
the Science mail is in the Computer Center and then it's an HP like with twenty terminals
Aha
and, and just one printer
And the printer must be there, but full
they never lend you the printer.  Yes, the monkeys there, no, no, to send it to us.  Like, you have to have your account and you can record, no?  you suppose
so there so you can
Hey and if you record a disc and if you record a disc and then you take that disc someplace else
but the terminals don't have, don't have a clock, right?
Aye that
Like, you can't, surely you can, what happened is that, I'm not, I haven't been really nailed down, I haven't used it to
Yes
to get anything other than a message, a friend who left the school, she thought it was madness, and she went with her boyfriend to study medicine in
something like England, and she went with him
Hmm
and so, and she had an adventure, after she broke it off there and the last thing I knew was a mail that she sent me, that if she didn't come by September that meant that she had gone to China
Wow
She sent me this from Italy
Wow
so, so, I said
hey, that's great
Mm
and that in September I paid one hundred eighty
Mm
and that I left the other eighty for when you receive the rent of September
Mm
I paid this October
Mm
and I paid until March
Mm
in other words that I paid a million eighty
Mm
which is, which are six
in in in the
months
yes
in in in October

the whole year again
Oh, oh oh in oh
the whole six months
yes, aha, or before, aha
as I did aha
and what he he he will have left seven hundred and forty from the rent of, of mmm, of August
Mmm
that he should deposit them on the card right away so that the card if free once and for all the card
ah because he didn't deposit for me now
aha
because he paid himself the thing from Tono
aha
yes?
ah
he didn't deposit for me, he didn't deposit this month the thing for Tono
ah good
see?
aha so well that's why it's better that he pays so that he pays the seven hundred and forty
aha Mmm
Mmm
seven hundred and forty
aha seven hundred and forty and that that apart from two hundred and sixty
besides two hundred sixty
aha that I paid one hundred eighty in in in September
Mm
before the second or before the second of Septe-
Mm
and the fifteen or the twentieth that they give him the rent
Mm
so he pays at once the other six months from October to March
Mm
Mm

and now he's going to take another exam, yes, in August
take advantage mm, I mean that he took advantage.Mm
yes, well. He continues studying. Aha, he continues studying
and you are doing better with the English
ah, no, well more or less, because sometimes, since William only talks to me in Spanish, he doesn't want to talk to me in English, it affects me a lot
Mm, yes, yes because since you are still not too
yes
exactly ah you haven't gone to the embassy anymore
yes, eh
you keep going?
yes I haven't gone in a week because they already want me to do things outside of there and, and I don't have confidence still with my English
Mm. But there in the embassy you do speak in pure English or also in Spanish
No, pure English
only there with your in-laws
yes, only with, yes and there, there's no choice, and every time that I come, I come with good English
Aha
but from there well I go back again
yes
because with them, only English
only in- exactly
and a little by force
a little by force
there there's nothing else
oh yes well that's how you'll learn
but
from with-
but here with
with William
your relative
well you tell your daughter to help you in that form, afterwards you help her.
she looses patience, yes, but she looses patience because sometimes I don't understand her
well when you don't understand her then let her tell you in English, what she doesn't
in Spanish
it's Spanish but while you speak everything in
well yes, but she forgets, for him it's easier because
yes, but for you it's more
well yes
yes
yes
oh my life, how much we miss you here daughter
yes?
Oh, yes
well and you said that not
when who told you that
eh
I have never told you
no, I know, oh I was kind of sad, yesterday I called you
aha
and so, William told me, talk to your mother, and well
Hmm
but, but there was I am going to hurry up with my English to have things to do because
with your English, well yes, exactly
well, the truth is that I get bored here
Well yes
a lot
you are like I am here looking what to do, and what to do and what to do, and what to do
oh well yes but you at least have that huge house, I
aha
it's a little egg, that's what it is
And the and the apartment
the apartment is like my apartment
Mmm
or a bit bigger or better distributed

Ah, you'll have something to do, more things, yes
yes, well yes, yes I will have more things to do
and is your bed new?
yes
ah, that's good
yes, that one the
grudgingly
grudgingly but, but between his mom and I, that's the good thing that his mom helps me out
it's like your grandma, well
yes, his mom helps me out because he is is
he wanted a used one
yes, the mo- then he talked with his mother and told her that the bed cost, I think that four hundred fifty and seemed very expensive
and his mother said no, that it was cheap
because he doesn't know the cost of things
yes, yes, no, to na- everything for him is expensive, to me it's also expensive because it's in dollars
because you are not used to their prices
yes, but, yes it's cheap
yes but it's what Jose says, that he does not has an explanation, because everything there is very cheap, he says
is, is it depends, or I don't know, depends on the places, I have started to find very cheap places
Ay so, yes well the case is similar to
when you come
when you arrive here, also that, mmm
aha, ay yes, when you come I know where to take you
aha
ay OK I already know where they sell cheap shoes and clothes, cheap items for the house
Mmm Mmm, and so little by little, little by little
that those towels that my mother Elena gave to me

but my aunt bought them
aha
they are very cheap here, but very cheap, mother
Yeah
cheap, cheap
Yes
I bought the set, to complete the set, i bought some hand towels
Uh huh, uh huh
To complete the set
Oh, that's good
Very cheap, they costed me three dollars, the three of them
Yeah, three dollars there, oh
That's three thousand, no, nine thousand pesos
Um
a little bit over nine thousand pesos
yeah
you see
yeah, they're very
so, they're very cheap, and in that store, i found several things that i can buy very cheap
they're fine, and if you go walking, watching, watching, you're going to find them even cheaper
Yeah, it's just that, well, but you know how long I've been here
Right, exactly
Yes, yes, you have to get around
let's see what else you can find now you are moving there
yes
it is very far from the university
oh, it is miles away
oh, how cool because you already have, but it is not a dangerous neighborhood
no, it's very nice, it's very nice, I liked it because
oh, how good child, that's what I was thinking about, you see
yes
there the
yes William, that's why we took so long to find it, because this
to find
because she wants a nice neighborhood, and she doesn't want
Mmm
to take trains where
Mmm
I have to pass through dangerous areas
Mmm
because it is quite messy here
and doesn't, eh, doesn't William has his car yet
yes, yes
and they go in the

Hmm
Hmm
Ah now nice girl, maybe you don't have to go, well, go out and walk a little and that but yeah with

the test
yes, the written test and they give you a test that's phy-
Carla has a little bit of tachycardia, yesterday they did an electrocardiogram, but

Mm
problem for now. Today we are going to go have lunch to Regatas, Carla is going to where her
mother in law
sister in law Lucy
Ah

Aha
and no, and rather, then almost every day she comes here to have lunch, we are happily together all the time because I was sad that Carla left well to Franca's, right?
To Franca's, yes, yes, I can imagine
Yes so, Bernard, how is he?
Good, very good, we are here with Diana
Good. And your job, that of your job
Nothing. They called me on the phone and told me they were going to get another person, I already imagined it, and that
why, ah?
because it wasn't my specialty, I've never done that, it's for reforestation of urban areas
I know, I know, for that, but for the other that they said that they were going to need
Ah, but they still haven't open the position for that
Those haven't called you Ah, well that, that
that still depends on their budget and if the position opens up it will be in a few months still
Ah, well, eh
then they called me, those were the ones that called me, and told me, we won't be able, that, have you gotten that letter or not?
Yes
ah then why do I tell you the story again, that already
but yes
that that but that they wanted to keep me in mind when a position in something else opens up and that if I accepted and I told them that yes
Yes that will already be
so if that opens up, it will open up in three, four months
Ah, still
which I don't care, because I still have to do my thesis, right?
Okay, listen
And, but, Mm
it could be that, Maria Elena's brother it seems he's coming in August, the one that lives in Toronto
Yes, but how am I going to send anything to Toronto. Yes, tell me
Okay wait, then, eh I'm going to send some things to Toronto with him and he will send them to you to Ottawa, okay? a package?
Ah, ah, okay, ah, what you
Yes, well
what you're saying is that Maria Elena's brother is going to come to Canada, he's returning to Canada, he's in Peru?
Yes
Oh
Yes, he/she's coming to Lima, coming to Lima in August
Yeah
and he/she goes back in September, and since there is a lot of Ana Lucia's clothes
Yeah
So, uh, well, we send it with him
Oh, dude

Sure
Which thins, more or less, uh, because here there are, things for the baby
Uh huh
And, so, we send them with him, uh, Maria Elena told me yesterday, she volunteered, and i told her, look, there's trust enough to say 'i'll send this to you' ¿right?
Uh huh
That's it, hey, ¿how long does the conversation last?
It's fifteen minutes, supposedly, they're going to tell me when it's over, don't worry
Oh, yeah, so tell me more about Manuela
What else can i tell you about Manuela, well, she's really fat, you don't know where her big eyelashes came from, mom
She doesn't have
she's with eyel-
No
Very long eyelashes, black, long, very beautiful, it is
No when are you going to take the pictures

Oh, yes
it is already clean

Yeah
And it is
and Colon, How is doing?
Ah, he is fine, they are fine, all of them are fine, she
They are fine
Yes, yes, yes, they are very well, they are very well, ah hmm
Oh, how good
everybody is fine, and what else can I tell you about Manuela, nothing, well she is bald
why
because the the
they give her so much milk, where do you think she's going to drop the bottle, the bottles of milk, and yet, give her cereal instead and forget the milk.
but she's still
sure, he drinks nine, a full bottle of Coca-Cola full of milk, that's why he has so much battery
fine, well
she doesn't eat solids, poor baby
Is she pretty?
The lion king
Yes, is she pretty?
Oh, gorgeous
Yes, oh
gorgeous, take Manuela
Oh, yes I'll bring her
yes, take Manuela, oh, I've had so much fun
I've been trying to talk to Bernard because when his parents were here, we were going, we went out, one night, a Tuesday, to the movies, so
Yes, oh, that's great, sure, it's great,
and we went to see a movie, I wanted to watch the Lion and Bernard didn't, didn't, so I'll rent it. Nice?
Oh, nice, nice, nice, I've had so much fun with the babies, I believe, so much
Yes
is that I have compared what Walt Disney did in my time
Ah, yes, there's no comparison, yes.
No, that sure well, listen not so much, well, don't push it
no but, it's that I remember that I've seen Mariana's cassette the one that has Snow White
Of the
and you see, well, completely a great difference
yes well, a basic difference, totally. Listen, Marcos already left on a trip to Ica
Ah, how nice! how long
all over Lima he's left on a trip, all the kids, there's no kid in any house they've all gone out
ah really July twenty eight, yesterday was July twenty eight
since it was happy twenty eight, I wrote in the letter
ah I haven't gotten that
how is it possible that you've forgotten
I forgot
what horror
is that Diana has been here and already
you should've stood up and sang the anthem
Diana has arrived
early in the morning what horror, how embarrassing, don't do that to me, it bothers me twenty eight so, we celebrated yesterday. Look that after many years, all the Peruvians we say happy twenty eight, happy twenty eight, happy twenty eight
Really?
unbelievable, what the people's mood is, ¿right?
Right
that no one, well
No one
it was amazing, hey, amazing and all, Lima, all the boys have gone to... they're going to Huarás, they're going to Ticomaría, they're going to Huancayo
Oh
they're going to, they've gone everywhere, and Marcos has gone to Ica because, of course, the day before, I'm leaving tomorrow, ¿right?
¿and who did he went with?
He went to Tocongo with his friends from school. He went to Tocongo to wait for the omnibus to pick him up, so, well, i don't know, he'll probably return on monday, or
And, ¿has he called you?
At night, maybe
¿Has he called you?
No, no, he hasn't called, but yeah, i spoke to another boy that called
Oh, yeah, that everyone's fine
Yes, i hope so, but that's it, daughter, we miss you a lot, ¿do you miss us a little?
Yes
No, because you didn't remember the twenty eight
¿how's my daddy?
fine, fine, let's see, ¿will you talk to your father for a while?
I don't know if i can
why so much time, well
I don't know if
Hello?
I already don't know if we can change person, I imagine that yes, okay
ah, no, then no, better ask for the next one
No is that, no
listen, tell me, is that
Yes I can only make one call
Ah, okay, okay, okay, but it's of another person, ah, with one person only, ah
you can make only one free call of fifteen minutes, after you can't call ever again
Ah, what a shame
because if not, imagine, well all that the university that's doing the research pays
what university is that?
is in the United States, I think that it's from Philadelphia, I don't know
Listen, and I told you what Veronica's mom did to me, right?
listen and what happened, she called you to say
Ah?
that, that she had a cold and couldn't go
the same day she called Franca to tell me she couldn't come, I almost had an attack, I had already bought all my things, everything
that's what you tell me, but why, how strange, she probably had something else to do, she didn't feel like going or what
No, she says that she had a cold, it could be, ah, because I've had a really strong flu
Mmm
After that I fell, I twisted my leg horribly, but I'm better now
why, but what, but can you walk or what
Listen here at the house Yes, yes, yes, I have been able to do everything but for two days I was very poorly, just yesterday
How yes you fell
Well, I twisted my foot well I fell from an uneven place, one of those silly twists, no? here at the house's garage's door and the purse went to the track until Conamarco, oh, it was terrible. On Sunday of
lost, Italia lost
Listen by penalties they say, no?
did you watch the soccer?
No, I don't watch
You didn't watch anything, over there
I don't have cable well here only they show it only on cable here te-
by penalty, by penalty, it lost. Well
and but which team was better
Brazil was better
Ah, then
you know that Italy plays with cheats, no?
Mmm
Let's see what happens, what happens this or that
Hmm
but here we had a lot of fun, well, the soccer championship, because we were busy watching this all day
sure, how nice, I wanted to see, but
yes, it was really great, this championship was nice.
and how was the inauguration, sweetie?
the inauguration was really hard
Hmmm
really hard, bad.  Imagine that the
Hmm
that you have to throw a pitch in an arch
Hmm
and suppose that, at the arch falls from the throw, no?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
and the ball doesn't go in
aye, how brutal, but it shouldn't
the ball didn't go in
It had to be tested
Hey but they had to repeat the scene and they didn't repeat and the turuban arch fell so it was the grace, that they sang and
Sure, sure, and he hit a really hard kick that broke the arch
The arch broke and the ball didn't go in and everyone, and nothing went in
the gringos must not have noticed, gringos are so... i don't want to say that, but they're...
Yeah, that's why I'm being very careful
gringos aren't so... well, they don't know about football, they probably didn't even notice
that's why I'm
they must have thought that's how it is, not getting the ball into the lodge
Because you can easily understand Portuguese
Yeah, yeah, well
Yes
No, i understand it well, and well, i mean, i have to learn, uh, i have to learn english, i need it
Well, sure, but
but, but
but well, you can 'defend' yourself
but to survive
Yeah, yeah, and how do you like Elisa
oh, awful
Awful
yeah
Mother called her last night
She called her
Yes
her mother
yes
Her mother, uh, i don't know
because
no, n-
The mother called me yesterday and said he had called but she was asleep, she talked to Monica and she left a phone number and that she was going to call again
and today at five in the morning it was eleven o'clock in the evening and she hasn't called yet
five in the morning
Yes, when she left for work she was going to call because it's eleven in the evening and she'd be home. You weren't then.
Oh but it's because here', it's eleven PM here
Sure
Oh yes
No, it's six hours less
Yes. Oh, we weren't here, no.
Oh
We weren't
well that's what she said, that she was going to call you so, I thought she had left a phone number because she was sleeping, it's now two times that she has called and she's asleep so she can't answer.
Yes
she wanted to talk to her and that she was going to call, oh it would be great if she could tell me when she's going to call, that's what I said
because when I was leaving it was eleven PM and so they'd be home because it was more expensive during the day
Sure but why doesn't she call around ten PM
And what time is it there? Maybe you are not home anymore.
It's three PM
But you might not be home, you don't eat at home.
No, man, no, but Luisa is here at that hour, oh
yes? good
I think that it's good, if she calls her, she calls her
maybe she'll call her again today
If she calls her at ten, at ten or at eleven at night that is a good time
Mmm
because yes, I think that Luisa is at home
well she, mmm maybe she'll call me today to ask me, she told me that, that she wanted to speak to her, that she had called twice but
that she was always with Monica, that she wasn't, and that she wanted to be with her
No, she didn't speak to, she only spoke to Monica, she didn't speak with
Yes, that's why, because she says that in bed, that she didn't even realized
No And
Good
And nothing
And then she doesn't get English
Nothing
Ah
Nothing
Yes, mother, well also she hasn't been here long, eh?
Yeah, sure, but she should
And then on the street she can't talk to anyone
On the street.  On the street here you don't talk to anyone, mom
Well, you know
No, yes, but it's really hard, man, at least we have to do something here at home and I have to come to go, to explain to our uncle what we want.
Ah because to buy and this you can't then
No, but buying is really easy
Yes
Sure, buying is much more easy.  You always see the prices, you see everything, no?
Hmm, and the price that's in, dollars, sure
Sure
And there are things to eat there
Yes
There are, yes
Yes
There's bread and so
Well bread is more difficult, what there really is is bread from the mold.
There's bread yeah like Bimbo and so
Yes, the same, so these things
Yes.  And there's milk
Yes, yes there is
But, but not
What
There's none, Delarza there's none
bo-
Yes, and it's good that
Bah, it's normal
Ah, yes and there's coffee and chocolate milk and all that
Man sure, sure, mom, how is there not going to be
Well man, there are other things, other products that they use instead of that, man
But milk
Well, powder milk
the milk and the eggs
Yes, mm
And nothing, now the
And does Enrique know how to make the foods
what? Enrique knows?
Does Enrique know how to make the foods
Good, yes, there's a lot of food for example, there in the lab the people well go eh, take, in the afternoon, the meal of the afternoon they call it the, right?
Mm
And, and they normally take it to the lab and
They eat there in the lab
Yes
Mm
And, there's even, the Japanese eat and dine in the laboratory
Mm
you understand, they just go home to sleep
Wow, they are there the whole day
Yes
Wow
And, mm and well, there are many people, you know, that take the food
Take the food from home already made
They take take the, the food of the afternoon which is lighter than the dinner, here the dinner they make it at six or seven in the afternoon
Mm
and it's the main meal of the day
It's how they eat then
Yes, yes is the most typical time, right?
Ah, yes
And mm and of, and of, I mean, they eat the and at night, they dine
Mm
And, and for example, what I'm doing now is eh, there's a place that I mean at one or two, eh, they give it for five dollars
Mm
They are six hundred pesetas, seven hundred, and you can eat whatever you want
Mm
then, I just leave the laboratory and go to eat at one or one thirty
Mm
And later at, and later when the night comes at nine or like that well, we make some dinner, we make something
Mm. And and those kids that take the dinner there, that take them made from their house
Yes, well, there are - there are people, there are people that take, that the kitchen and later look how it is, in the lab there's a refrigerator to put the food
Aha
and a microwave
to heat it up, ah, look, well it's good
Why
Because you have maybe you feel bad and want to make some camomile tea or a coffee or anything and you can make it in the microwave Ah, that no
Well, woman
Then
And, mm And nothing, then is like that
Mm, good
is like that, what we have to fix is that of the, of the housing, let's see, let's see, what?
Yes, you don't find, don't find
Yes, yes, already, I mean what there is, we already know, understand, I mean
Yes
eh, the hassle is what Luisa is going to do, understand, because
and why you are not sure if she's staying or not
There's, look, there's a possibility, I mean eh, we don't know, she still doesn't know, she's going to go to immigration, what happens is that since she doesn't find out anything in English
Yes, you have to go with her, always
No, I don't go, but well, there are people that speak Spanish, eh?
Ah, yes
understand, there are people that speak Spanish, but the thing is well, if she stays perhaps she stays for three more months, right?
Mm
they give her a visa for three more months
Mm
then she would stay until December
Mm
and later, well in December, perhaps eh mm and I don't know, I mean we leave in Christmas and she can't come another three months in January
Mm
she would stay well, quite a long time, otherwise if she has to leave eh, what we are thinking is that if she has to leave in September, she will return in January
because she can return
Sure, three - she what- she can do is in September, go home
Mm
and return, and return
Mm
do you understand
yes, yes, but he has to spend two tickets
He has to leave the country and enter again
Sure but he has to spend on the tickets
Sure
Sure
But it's
it's a mess
what?
it's a mess
yes sure it's that, for example, the English classes eh, in a place we saw, they charge, for three months, two hundred thousand pesetas
Wow
that they're expensive
Colime
and she's going to an English course now that is very good, for fifteen thousand pesetas, for three months
fifteen thousand pesetas for three months
Yes
ah, that's very cheap, cheap
very cheap, very cheap, really cheap
Cheap
then almost. almost compensate to go to Spain and the come back.
Yes for the same amount of money.
To go to Spain and come back And, and enroll in those English courses than enroll in the others and have the visa
Yes
Do you understand
Yes, yes I understand, I understand
what happens is that she does not like to come back to Spain, do you understand
hmm
because she thinks, that if she goes to Spain, her parents are going to tell her, see, you have to come now, go that way, spend the money, do you understand
Yes, of course
Do you understand
Yes, of course
those things
Yes, yes of course
then she doesn´t eh hmm at first she said that for that for going to Spain and then come back and leaving again in December, that not
that it does not
on the way neither the parents are going to eat her, man, but that doesn't matter if they tell her something, what are they going to say to her Well, man
is like it is going, because
fine, man, yes yes also has to come like you say, of course I neither think that that it will be nice for her, she will not like it, I say so
What
for instance coming here now, staying for eight days and going back again
what
she won't like it, I think. She will rather stay there and coming in December
sure
sure, it's better
sure, but if she can't, what shall she do?
Yes, man, of course, what to do of course, if cannot, has to come,neither is not going to be eaten
Yeah, but I am talking about, and leave again
Yes I know, you think about that. It is a problem, do you know?
that is That is what is giving
yes, he is giving hits
Yeah, is going around, because I, I, if she leaves eh, I have almost decided it, do you know what am I going to do, is to take a room
with a living room and a kitchen, and share it with another person
Hmm
so the room is for you
Yes
and then a living room, and a kitchen and a bathroom to share with a person
Hmm
and that costs around sixty-five thousand pesetas
Hmm
but, it is fine, because where we were now, a room costs that money, a little bit more and and I share the bathroom and the kitchen with nine more people
damn, that is a problem, that is a crap, besides, son
understand this way I share only with a person
of course, man, it is, it is, is better even when you have to pay more
no, it is, it is, later, another possibility, but it is a dorm for students
Hmm
Well
Yes
well, listen, I am here at a phone with several lines, and another line was entering, and since it is my job, I have to answer
Yes
Eh, look, I wanna tell you something, there are some, there are some things that are difficult, for instance in English you can't say 'sexpercios', how you call it?
no I would need a very specialized dictionary
sexpercios, right?
and, mm, how would you say? how would would you spell Filoctetes, for instance, P H I
L O C T E T E, just the PH, that's the only difference
P H and then teta, right? Filoctetes, Filoctetes
Filoctetes, just like in Spanish, but with a PH
Oh, alright. Listen, one more thing
Yes, yes
you will notice, in the package I'm sending you
Yes
some things I took, right?
Yes
because, because they have a tone, eh
Yes
well, I would say bragging, right? but
No, wait, yes the children are here and they don´t let me talk on the phone and touch the devise and all that stuff. Tell me
then, well, you are going to see that what I cut is nothing a very little, it is a phrase of the first chapter.
Yes, which phrase, do you remember it?
Yes, the thing about Cervantes, it is, it is, it is all that, all that paragraph has a justification tone but you are going to see how I replaced it with another very interesting thing
Ah, well, it is fine, yes
in in where, where simply I expose what you are saying and
in in other terms
Hmm, yes, but I take out all that could look like you are justifying yourself constantly, right?
Ah, yes, Yes
justify the reason of so much data, and why there are not tables and statistics and all that, okay?
Yes
that is already said before
Yes
and that it is understood that in a work that is not of academic nature
Yes
it is not  a nature like a specialized magazine when there should be all the references, to the general public in general that doesn´t matter
Yes Yes No, it is an essay
and I also put there that even in the academic world even a, even when an article has all the references and data, that do not guarantee the general conclusions
so, correct or acceptable by the scientific community
Ah, very good, great
because what really matters is the opinion of the scientist group in that area, right?
Yes, of course, of course
a general conclusion can not be based simply on, on, on right data, but it has to have a right logic whose final interpretation depends on the final opinion of the experts group, so I want to put that clear
Yes
to state that accumulating data isn't either a warranty of right conclusions
Oh, well, alright, thank you very much
well, so you will get those two chapters, but when are you leaving?
eh, we are leaving on eighth
August the eighth
Yes
Mmm, you won't get it then
it is Sunday, well, when it gets here Javier will keep it for me
another important thing is that, eh, maybe I will be in Denmark on, the week from twelfth to eighteenth
of August?
of Aug- no, yes, of August, no, September
oh, September from twelfth to eighteenth
from twelfth to eighteenth of September
Yes
then, where will you be during that time period?
well, look, mom is coming back on September the fifteenth
Mmm
and I stay here until the end of September
oh, in Spain
in Spain, yes
Oh
and we are first going to Holland as we want to relive our honeymoon trip.
Yes
now that we've been married for thirty five years, we are even staying in the same hotels and all of that
Mmm
and we are going to go to Holland, even until August twelve.
Mmm
and then we are going to Spain and then, probably, we will travel through the South of France
Mmm
and then we will go to Muñeca de Granada
Mmm
and then, my mom is coming on September fifteen and I'll stay in Granada until the thirty as I have some things to do there
I thought you were going to go back to England where
No, no because, we haven't been offered that opportunity, just KLM, you know?
Oh, oh, so we won't see each other
No.
No, because I already went to Spain and it was really expensive
Sure, really expensive
but if they went to England, he could come here
Yes
Ah, good, well then, no way
Yes
Well, another
so, the days that you'll be in Copenhagen, Copenhagen, right?
No, in Arjus
Arjus, from what days to what days
Hmm, from the twelfth to the eighteenth
twelfth to eighteenth of September, well, then hopefully I'll get there, a little surprise
Hmm well bet-, no, no surprises because I'm also planning to see if it's possible for me to go to Munich
Ah
To go to Munich to see Luis Aguilar who's there
Ah
hopefully, to go where I have another friend
Yes, fine, well then we'll communicate either by telephone or by letter, right?
Good
you already know that you can, well, it's really difficult because we're going to be in Madrid for just a short time
Well, yes
Yeah
So yeah
and well, in Granada we don't have a phone
Uh huh
Uh huh
That's why I'm telling you, if you're interested in a plan now, before
Yeah, no, well, not at the moment, ¿right?, i mean, we'll be there independently and you'll tell us afterwords, ¿right?
Well, very well, hey, another matter
Yes
Uh, ¿is my mom around there?
Yes, she's here
To tell them to send me my baptism act
A new one
Yeah, no, no, i don't have it, because we want to arrange our
oh, wait, I'll call her
yes
Betty, come quickly, phone
¿Hello?
Yes, hey mom
yes son
we are going to need the sacrament of baptism paper
Ah, well
my sacrament of baptism
Yes
then you go and ask the parish priest of San Antonio all the information that it's required, all that it's needed for
Well, there they already told you, the sacrament of baptism and what else, the sacrament of confirmation
I don't know about that, at least of baptism
Yes, I think so yes, it has to be baptism and confirmation
No well, the confirmation I did it over there with Madrin in the Repairer, well yes
Yes, but they had to have given a paper
To San Antonio?
not there, but, no, in Cathedral
ah, uh, no, well, then it takes too long
well, for when do you want it
Well we don't know, they are taking their time on that they want us to leave, to a one week retreat, imagine with how busy we are how are we going to find a week and all that. No
listen, well, son. but it's that you don't have a little time for God?
impossible. No, well, for God, yes. For bureaucracy, no.
Ah, well so then, I know that you are always super busy, but in any case, well make an effort to finish with that already
Listen just hurry up because since this call is free, they are going to cut if off at exactly fifteen minutes
Yes, yes, fine, that's why, so you want to take care of the baptism, I'm also going to look into the confirmation thing
if you want I can send it to you through certified mail so that you get them
well, that you receive them as soon as possible without spending too much money.
Fine, lets do that
right? I'm not telling you to send them in those special overnight delivery services
Yes
overnight
Yes, yes, because it's more expensive. Fine
But it's faster that way. Go ask the San Antonio priest if they are going to allow me to do it here because I haven't spoken with that woman and I don't know if they will ask for the baptism certificate
Yes
they did requested Laura's
Yes
But she didn't have bring her confirmation certificate
but when she had her baptism, they gave her the certificate right away
Yes
Oh, they didn't give her anything on that day but she then went there and they gave her the papers.
Yes, yes, yes, she already has her papers.
confirmation and baptism certificates because she only had one ceremony
Mmm, mmm
Fine, well, I believe that they will only ask for, maybe that parish is going to ask our parish here to
Saying that if you didn't sign up here and all that, but they'll do that
Uh huh
We cannot do that
Right
Because let's say that's how they have to ask for reports,
Well, I'm counting on you with that, ¿right?
Ok, then, son
Before you eave
Yes
that this stays already sent.  We have the illusion that on August eighteenth is also the wedding, our wedding party.
Sure
right?
Well yes
so that it was also the same day
Sure, that it would coincide
but, well, believe me, the woman who, we came here with the guy from Stanford, the pastor from here at the university and
Yes
I delegated everything to a woman who gives the introductory courses and this
Aha
like a deacon who also gives conversion courses for those who want to convert and
Hmm
and many things in the diocese
Yes
Well, and we talked about it, and this woman's husband is dying form a tumor, we said two months ago that we would talk later and we already talked
Hmm
she's stalling and it's a scary time, Laura wants to go with others, she said no, we're going
Well yes, with other people who were less compromising
and they went, no, you have to see what fools there are here, no, no
Well, I'm asking Gabino to tell me what's going on in Santo Domingo now
okay, well, he'll tell you. I was just reading about it. Well, I sent you one magazine with your mo, it's called Rumbos, it has a
Mmm. Where did you see my mom?
information
didn't you write to me?
Oh? Yes, I sent you a letter and some documents, oh, so there's some really interesting information in the last number of Rumbos magazine that is about
oh, five hundred and seventy four million Pesos on donations to the Catholic church and that's why the Cardinal has a very intransigent and furious position. The government
has donated five hundred and seventy four million  Pesos. Hello?
Aha, for
for maintenance jobs and just to repair the Cardinal's house, it cost the fabulous amount of you know how many million pesos, it's amazing, it's shameful!
they have a tunnel that goes from the Cardinal's house to the vestry.
the amount, the Cardinal's house cost the poor people the fabulous amount of seventeen million Pesos, so that this good man
can often be heard saying that people are shit, it's amazing, that only happens here, in a country like this one, only here can something like that happen.
Oh, tell me something
and so, they annulled the votes of that district
oh, no, well. There's a resolution from the District Electoral Board that annulled the elections in that district and now the Central Electoral Board is reviewing it, they have the final word on it.
Oh
it's a mess, two judges have resigned to the Board, from the PRB because they can't, they are well known reformists.
so now, a press statement came out saying that the government of the United States is asking for new elections.
They are asking for new elections.
The Board hasn't replied yet, they have to vote in one, in a community in Elias Piña, yet. There's a mess there because
and what about Iguey?
no, it's all forgotten now, the mess is now in, you know that there's a judge that rules in favor of the PRD
and there's another one that rules in favor of the PLD so, they have two opinions and the Board's President, he wants to approve the reform
so, they say that the ones in the PRB and the PLD, they decided that the party that would get that seat was going to be the PRD but
they decided and then they signed the document without reading and the resolution said that the Reformists won so, it was a mess and the two judges quit and they said that they had been cheated, it was a mess
and then, the two Reformist judges, Matos Berrios the one that killed a woman, only in this country can a man like that be a judge, and other guys who are also Reformists and
and the PLD what do they say about this?
the PLD has proposed to call for the House of Representatives to approve a new Constitution that says that the reelection of the President is prohibited in consecutive terms and that there will be separate elections
to limit the power of the
nothing will happen
that article 155 that talks about the President of the Republic should be modified, but they haven't, nothing is certain yet, they haven't approved it yet.
the, so, the cardinal is openly speaking about this
the cardinal, sure, since the beginning
and, what about the priests or the other members of the church?
the bishops, they are Reformists and there's one group that is quiet now, but
the pact, they reached an agreement before the elections but it's useless now
a civility pact
Aha
it went south, all of it, all of it.
and the uncles from Haiti, how are they influencing the thing?
Well, eh, now I read in the papers yesterday that the United States put in fifty million dollars to, for the Dominican armed forces to reinforce
the vigilance on the border, eh, to keep accusing the government that it permit the, the
it seems that there will be an occupation, it seems like there will be
The, the
according to the news here, like, here, they present it like the game has been locked out
in Haiti
and, aha, aha, and since Clinton didn't know how to manage the thing
you and
and all this, the whole North American maneuver, what it left is a much more problematic situation because in some way, it's, it's forcing an intervention, but
in a country like you have just said, it's enviable and there's no way to cha- Aye, man, don't tell me that it's raining now, I can't believe it
what happened?
no, it's not raining
here there's a terrible drought
Aha
but they can, they can make these inflections in something that they're recording
yes.  Is there a lot of drought?
yes, I'm - ah, Mr. Reyers asked me about you, right now, I was there
Mr. Reyes or Mrs. Reyes?
eh, yes, they asked me about you, very touched, and he told me that they were
how are they
ah everything, they're going to move, I think, to another house, eh
but he's working
yes, but he's an official in a company in a free trade zone, they pay him two hundred dollars a week.
aye my God, what a disaster
no, no, it's a lie, they pay him a little more, but not much, but he told me that he's learning a lot about his career and so this is a point in his favor.  You take the
the quantity of time spent
Yes, they're going to signal in a second
well yes, so, life is
but they go, it goes less than ten minutes
life is like that, well, I'll send you, like I told you the other day, since I was clearly fine and so, clearly fine
clearly fine, I don't know how long this call will last, because look, we've talked, Gavino, for more than thirty minutes
ah no, I have a place, with Codetel,
you have a plan with Codetel
I have a reservation for the eighth, it's on a Thursday
the problem is that, this is what I was looking at, the Thursday, I don't really know if this is the most
but come to get me with a teren, girl
you're going to come to
Yes, in the morning.  What time will you get there
at noon, I'll ]
I arrive at that time, are you going to get me with the train, you don't know how to get here?
No, I mean, because probably Odelia won't be working and then we can go in the car
If I knew how to get there, I have no problems
No well, that
and besides I don't want to get to New York because there you have to take a train and there that is a hassle for me
Kity is going to Santo Domingo
When, and Eddie
ah, the fifth or the sixth, and Eddie is in that, still it's a little vague, but
the fifth or the sixth Kity is coming here
Yes, she's coming, she's going at the start of this month, the eighth
Ah, is good that she comes
the eighth, the, the, I don't know. She's going with Gustavo

so, you already know, I would like to be there to see what's going to happen
she should come after next week, which is very, very tense for me, very terrible, a lot of work meetings and crap. I don't have, the project has
fifteen thousand dollars, and doesn't have any more money, and I'm crazy for it to end and they don't appear anymore, to see if I find another job
or make a decision in my life, eh
but what do they say in Enda regarding that
in Enda they have no, they don't say anything because there is there is nothing, I mean, there is no alternative, the ones that have to finance and give the money are not responding
nor do they say anything, and Enda has no money
And she already called the Duma
Yes, the Duma has been asked a thousand times to say, what can be done
but they haven't answered yet.
they haven't answered after all that mess they made, they haven't answered. It's a serious problem. Oh, there's nothing I can do, Martina, I have to get a job.
Oh, don't say that, please, it's not
that's the plan, in the endless help plan and these people are offering me to go to Mexico but I must graduate first.

Hmm but it's not easy, I tell you, ah

oh, well, well, lets talk for a minute
Sonia, how are you, fine
hello, fine Janet, and you? Coquin told me that you are doing fine, right?
yes, we are fine, what about the girls?
Yes, kiddo and if they break you and --
Mmm
and then, you get ill, and any effort you make breaks your bone, and then they say you have very strong pain
Mmm. No, well, who knows
Poor girl
Listen, and how are Nora and Kike, did Kike get a job already?
Not yet, but now on August the fifteenth he is fighting to enter School Transportation, they came to --
He has route already, he has a route already, right?
Eh? I was offered thirty some kids --
Mmm
so I, well, hurry up, sell the van you have, buy the other one -- and he went to see the route already, he is with the guy who used to handle that route --
Mmm
Right? who is the driver of the lady -- and, and he goes with him in order to -- they went to see the route already, already --
now, it's just a matter of getting the van ready to start. Now if they call him -- to work, leave Marcos doing the transport
And he can --
and he applies himself to his other job
Well, that would be really good
Yes, because he is a very, very reliable young boy, very loyal, very honest, and, and, and he cares a lot about -- he loves that job, right?
Mmm
Too bad he doesn't have the chance to do it on his own, eh, so, actually, he tried to -- eh?
You are Kike would be part of a society or
No, his wage, he'd get a wage.
Oh.
The boy would get paid, right? And he'd work and take care of the truck and all of that.
Oh.
Like the other lady used to do, the one that he worked with, she assigned me the route, she lives in Mexico -
Mmm-
so, well, she was running the whole thing from Mexico -
Mmm.
so, this guy is really good. I trust, Pepe, that he'll work really hard and if he doesn't stay, well, at least, this
Mmm.
because, for example, it's thirty something, around forty boys.
Mmm.
Plus some more, lets say fifty boys, around one hundred, it makes five million.
no, that's fine.
Well, yes, it is, right? Well, and then if we get more, the better, now, if he goes to work there, he can keep this and then he'll do great. I already went to Victoria to change the name of the concision to Nora's.
Mmm, mmm.
that's all, from parents to children, for the vehicle that I bought, I bought it in her name right? So that she owns it.
That's great, mom.
Well, that's what I'm doing, I'm trying son, yes.
And Laura, How are you doing?
well, fine,within what may be, fine. Fine, fine. well, working in the office and following, working in the business -- and going out with Pepe and her friends --
Hmm.
Really?
Very good, Is she still working with my dad?
Well there all - eh?
Is she still working with my dad?
Well your dad is who is working, there, with her.
Yes, but they are helping each other there. Ah, well, how good.
well, yes, they are helping each other a lot. well the two of them are there, very good. God bless.
Hmm.
She and I could not even talk.
Hmm. Of that.
Eh?
Of that or anything else?
Of nothing.
Hmm.
Of nothing, of nothing, very limited, how are you, I am fine, good -- I need this, well, yeah, do it and that is all --
Bye. we begin a conversation and we can´t. no, no, we cannot -- we cannot, I don´t know how poisonous is this  girl, I don´t know, what criteria she has, who knows. if she, but lets see, she will reconsider it, yeah --
waters will get its track and that is all, right? Lets see what happens --
It is fine.
Listen, tell me about the child, how were things in Canada --
No man, he was happy, mom, loved it, because --
Oh, well, so much space --
Yes, is that those people have a huge house --
Oh, I imagine it.
then, in fact they have, those people have a lot of money, then, so --
Yes.
the gentleman had some land to plant, right?
Yes, those in front of his house, where was the barn? Aha.
Those, well -- then in that, those lands, he grabbed a piece of those to the river --
Aha.
And there he made his new house, he built it and all.Aha.
Aha. Ah, no well they are - is very laborious that man --
Then, so -- well they have a very big land, then the children have the opportunity of, his grandchildren were there when we went, two of his grandchildren --
Ah, right, to play with --
Yes, a boy that is a year older than Alfredo, and a girl that is around ten years old --
Aha aha.
ten or eleven years, I don´t, I don´t remember
Uh, shut up, very well
then he was happy, and then they would go to fish at the river there, he didn't fish anything, he didn't fish anything, right? but
No way! Not even tadpoles!
No, but just the fact of being there with the fishing rod was
Ah, yes, yes, yes
enough, and then they have a vegetable garden there
Aha
You see that they like to plant vegetables
Yes, yes, yes
then Alfredo, realize, pulling the carrots from the ground and that they would wash them and eat them
Oh, what!
and then playing between the corns, between the corn cobs and all, no man, they were but
Uh no! a fabulous experience!
fabulous, yes, is that- it was a happy thing. Eh, there were some pea pods
Yes, the peas
then, they would go cut the peas and then they would peel them and take them out and eat them
Like that raw? yes, yes, yes.
Raw yes, very tender and very delicious, then, no, man, Alfredo was fascinated with that, fascinated!
Ah, so that it repeats again, son, right? the opportunity of being able to live with nature in such way, how they have it. And then, they don't have animals anymore?
No, not anymore. The only thing there was there was a dog, so forget it, the dog was delighted.
Ah. Aha.
and, and no, man they were but verym verym very happy and then the other, the Jegan family, the lady with the cancer, has a pool --
Oh, what -- Yes, yes. Yes, yes I remember that she had a pool.
then they invited us there to bath, they invited around two or three times and, no man. happy in the pool.
Listen, and them then there is that big forest --
Ah, yes, we went to the forest, then well, happy Alfredo, forget it, loving it because he always like to walk in the forest, I don´t know if you remember when you were there.
Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes.
in this forest that is right here, in, in Plano --
Aha.
that, that ask you, to get into the forest --
Ah, yes, yes, look for the streams and all that stuff.
Well, he was fascinated with the forest.
Oh, what!
No, very happy, he must have lived a, a, a very beautiful experience. well, we, also were very happy, right? yes.
Yes, how good, son. well yes, of course, is that the people is so kind, very attentive all of them.
Very, very good people they are.
And happy to see your son.
yes, yes, no well, happy to see the three of us, hmm.
Yes, listen, Mrs. Guega didn't know Alfredito.
Yes, yes she knew him when he was around eight months old, before coming here, yes, we went to see them before coming here to Indiana --
Ah, yes? Ah, Ah, you went to see her.
Yes, and so, if you knew it as a baby, not now? right now is another child, right?
yesm oh, how good, well.
Yes, but everything fine, and we also knew the new  grandchildren she has, that we didn´t, didn´t knew, right?
Aha, yes.
And everything very good.
You, her house the same, there where she is in the --
Yes, very well, all, so, she is very well there, except that she is sick, right?
Oh, how beautiful, son. Well yes, it is a shame, truly. Truly, what a shame --
But for the rest, all, all is fine. Nothing more, two of her children, well -- got divorced, or they are getting divorced -- one got divorced and is going to marry again --
Yes.
and the other daughter is separated and looking for the divorce, but she also wants to get marry again --
Cool, so --
those are things that have happened to that family, things that happen.
Well, it is so common nowaday, everywhere.
Yes,
Everywhere. Well, lets see, son. well, how good that you went there. Lucy how does she feel.
Lucy has felt very well.
Ah, how good.
Then, right now, here what we brought is this, I feel a little bit ashamed to say it, is the worry of -- decide to change work or don´t, right?
That.
because, well really they are all very good opportunities, and
All of them, son. Well
eh, and the problem well is here the indecision that we have
Well, this is the thing, that you both have to agree, right? that the place you choose
Yes, no, Lucy supports me in anything, yes, yes
Ah, how nice, well you know, son, I already told you
it's just that, it's just that, yes, eh, I'm finding it really hard to make a decision
With the decision. Ah, well you don't know how much I ask God to enlighten you and that you get the best one.
Yes, yes, and I tell you that, I'm even embarrassed to say it because our problem is -- is that we have many opportunities and
Yes, and you are looking for the best place for the boy and the coexistence. Yes, sure.
And for all, right? then, that, that is the problem.
it comes out in the Agency, but he told me it hadn't been him, that was, that I made the mistake
the what
of asking in the agency
of what
if he, if he was leaving Sunday ahead of the old lady it could be because of that
because, what happened
that he told me that he didn't know if he was going
Oh, probably that, yes
well
probably one hundred percent is
look, yes that you do find it cheaper, Eddie, he asked him the same day that you said for the first time and he said that yes the only thing that I forgot
and, and those, those that they guy has
yes eh
he can find a round trip ticket to Santo Domingo with more or less special price
ah, well, okay, and Jenny has to call and look, Eddie, then how did it go there in customs and all that
fine because I, eh, and Veliz went in and confidentially recognized some people around there and we passed without any problem
okay, okay, didn't I tell you?
yes but, that I told you
but nothing, that you like it, Eddie, total pessimism
listen, they didn't assure me nothing, if they would've assured me another thing, I go with a different mentality I would've even brought the thing, the calculator, but they didn't assure me nothing.
You understand
Well, ¿and how did you find your mom and everyone?
well, skinny, she honestly looks like a ghost
¿really? but could that be a product of her father's crisis
this is, what can i say, so creepy, so
and how's the country
everything's normal, I'm not seeing, i haven't seen lots of military, you know, i haven't moved below, you know, because i got out of the airport, but anyway, not even at the airport, on the way out of the airport, nothing, i saw a lot of people, but no military, nothing like that
And i got there
Everything looks fine
still on the conference, they don't allow you to get your car up front but, i don't see anything else
Hey, ¿have you unpacked your suitcases and went to your mom's?
Right
and the kids, ¿did they arrive there with you?
yes
they were on the same flight
well, on the same flight
Oh, so you got together with them there
Right, when i was on the line, they had already checked there, they had checked there
Oh, well i didn't, i wasn't even aware of that
¿what?
That i wasn't even aware of that
oh no, but that's what i told you, that i was trying to, to reserve the same flight they had, or at ten
That yeah, this [...] called
at night
and what do the kids say
they're fine, they got there
Uh huh
Fine, no problem, i couldn't call your house or anything because i didn't have, you see
Right
Uh, any patience at all, i got here, i took the bags out, uh
and it's very hot, it's very hot
Oh, a lot, there's heat but it doesn't feel so
so overwhelming
impossible, yeah, like other times
Uh huh, but everyone's there, Amado and the rest
Oh, Mayi just left to go there, for the Mias it's Nelson and I, and all the boys that... and mom is going there
And Mrs. Maria will go with you
yes
Well, that sucks, that'll serve as vacations for her too
So tomorrow I'll try to go with my bag to stay on the car and take the things Ricardo sent me, among them there's some medication, you see
Mmmm
that I wanted to take it to her, I mean, form there I don't know, I would probably call your family and take Jenny's things to see who I give them to. Oh!
or take it right there, what is the name of the business?
Oh, Genesis
to Genesis
there is where she told you
what?
to take it
no, but I think it is the right place mom, she's always there
I don't know, I will ask her, she didn't tell you to leave it at Gabino's because Gabino is on the other side
no, because
Jenny look, what was I about to ask you? let me tell you before we run out of time, I was very well, because I stayed in places as long as I wanted with nobody pressing on me
Eddie is telling me that he wanted to take your things to Genesis because mom is always there
but I can keep with Gabino's letter and then give it to him when I get in touch with Gabino
and you didn't send it to Gabino
what I said was
she has a letter for there, for Jota's house
yes, for the nephews, so, I would give him the letter
she says at ht you should give it all to Gabino because he is going to the Minos tomorrow because he has some medicines of Ricardo, and he has to bring them tomorrow urgently
that's it, give it to Gabino, she says so
all
what she prefers, what do you prefer, that I give it to Gabino, right? that I give it all to Gabino
okay
look Eddie, well yes, the thing is that I, I went to where Dominguez, I spoke with Don Dominguez and so that, Domingues, and Cuevas was there doing some mechanic work
then I told him, Cuevas,can you take a look at that see that I have the shock absorber broken and Cuevas, he put the jack on the car, he lifted it and he laid underneath it,
and he told me that yes, and that the shock absorber was finished and that, that a liquid that held it, it had
come out and that had to be changed quickly because the bushings were going to be damaged, and that it was the same style as the Mercedes Benz, and that it wasn't different,
and that if we wanted, to buy it, and to take him the car, for us to leave it to him one day, and that he would put it on,
what I don't know is if one can trust Cuevas as a mechanic, I know he's been in that all his life, but I don't know if I can trust him, and one wouldn't have a guarantee, he told me that cost like
a hundred something dollars, one hundred sixty something I think
what?
the, the shock absorber,
two hundred something dollars
one hundred something the shock absorber, because he says that's not one of those regular shock absorbers, that is one of those that the Mercedes Benz has, that's a different thing,
yes
and that it cost one hundred something and that it takes a while to put it on, and that putting it on and putting it on and that he could do that for us, that there was no problem, for us to buy it and take it to him, that he would put it, but
eh, like I tell you, I, the information seemed important, now the other thing that he told me, that it's making a taca-taca-taca noise, that when I told him, that when I charge him it makes a taca-taca-taca sound, he says he doesn't understand because that can't make that taca-taca-taca sound.
but then I got tired of telling him, Cuevas take the car for a ride so that you can hear the taca-taca-taca, but there was no way, that if he was waiting for this, that he was waiting for the other and he didn't want to take it for a ride,
listen, he says that he can't understand what can sound taca-taca-taca, that that is loose, that is going to sound pum when it falls in a hole, but that it's not going to sound taca-taca-taca
I tell you so that if you can talk to someone about that, and also because, I don't know, I imagine that one should weigh in, he says he doesn't think the car should be used like that for too long.
you must fix it then
well and I arrived around eight in the evening, I left around six but there was a lot of traffic when we were coming back, at around ten we were
at ten, it was like eleven in New York and the Bronx so we stopped at Ita's and Lambini and mom spoke to them for a while and of Any
and I called Jenny to see how things were and I called Ricardo and so, well around one, the woman told me that you had called but that's impossible, so
nothing, I couldn't reach Ricardo, I called him twice at the agency but he wasn't there, so I called American and in American they explained it to me.
that sometimes, well, Eddie might have been bored so he called Ricardo to have fun, I didn't know if you were with the kids or not
and it's nothing, so we went to Dominga's, my mom and I, and while we were there, I decided to go to work and I remembered that I used to walk around
and I went up and down my job, everything was the same, I spoke with lots of my friends.
I mean, that you are alone. Ah?
Yes, I'm, I'm being a housewife, because they've left me their kids.
Are you cooking?
They've stayed, no, my dad is the one cooking. but I'm cleaning, just now I was finishing cleaning the bathroom
Listen, what have you heard from Monica.
I don't know anything, listen, I don't know anything.
You don't know anything? I wrote to her three weeks ago, but I, if the letter hadn't arrived, they would've sent it back to me, I hope she received it.
Because Kike told me that the address Monica had given us, was wrong, and he told me, if you're going to write to her, if you write to Mili or speak to her, give her the new address, so
Mm. And you don't know anything, neither, of Eva.
Nothing, I know absolutely nothing, besides, since I don't go by the bend, and little Paty called me
Little Paty - She called you? Hello?
for the vacations called me on the phone, yes.
Ah? What's happening, and, what does she say.
And nothing, she told me to go out these vacations, but since I've been with my aunts and uncles, I haven't gone out.
To go out? Little Paty told you?
Ah, to go out to ride bicycles, or to go to the movies. Did they already show The Piano over there?
Ah. You already have a bicycle? Don't tell me you already have a bike. Ah, yes, yes.
Did you already see The Piano? How is it?
Yes, but I haven't seen it, I haven't seen it. But they say it's very good. It won the Oscar for best actress, and the girl, the supporting actress, both, yes.
And the girl also.
Yes, they say it's very good, but I haven't seen it.
Aha. I want to go see it.
But, listen, what other news from Peru.
Listen, that of Fujimori, of Fujimori's wife
Of Fuji? What, what's to tell.
I don't know, it looks like they are going to get divorced. They say she's moved from the house, she's gone to live to a friend's house
Ah, really? Mm
And, and today in the newspaper it's come out that she has electoral plans. And, I don't know up to what extent that might be true, so, or what's behind all this, right?
Listen, well, we are probably going to get famous
And, are the fifteen minutes up?
No, a signal is going to sound, but probably we will become famous, because this conversation it's being recorded and I don't know maybe they play it there and you see it on TV
Come on, don't push it, then we don't have to talk about anything compromising Right?
No. Listen, but tell me, tell me, before the fifteen minutes pass, what else.
What else, no, I can't tell you any gossip because
Is that I've talked to you little
I can't tell you any gossip because already, I already know
What gossip. Tell me some gossip.
Is that this is going to be recorded.
Bah, no, but I'm not recording it.
Gossip from the neighborhood, I have none.
How's Tatiana, do you know anything?
Well, only, I don't know anything, anything about her, the truth is that I don't know anything about anybody from here from the neighborhood, the truth is I haven't see anyone
Listen, and when are you coming, Carmen.
And, ah, listen, don't push it, when the gringos want to give me the visa, even though I just want to go as a tourist, they don't want to give it to me.
Take advantage of it, take advantage of it, tell them
I bet you that if I was one of those that say, I'm going as a tourist, but I'm going to stay, there they give it to me, I bet you.
Ah, exactly, yes, listen, how incredible, but
No, Ah, they are so dense.
There, how's your job. You're on vacation, right?
Fine, tomorrow I start.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow I start, yes.
Ah, good.
And, I don't know, I feel lazy, I don't want to, well, I've had fun in these vacations, because since my aunt and uncle are here, I went like three days on a trip to the mountains
Mm.
from there, we've been here, with my cousins, Joana is huge, huge, huge, she's my size.
Listen, did you get the pictures I sent you?
From there. Listen, yes, they are nice, they are really, really, really nice
Okay, well, I hope you send me pictures of you
I don't have any pictures, I don't even have a camera, that was my mom's camera, on top of that it's kind of bad, the pictures come out bad, right?
No, it's alright. Listen, since there is no --
I want to buy another camera. What did you think of my --
Your what?
What did you think of my pictures, see--
You look great, you look great. There is no much more to tell, listen, here I am thinking about what to tell you
No, ah, you, listen how's your mom?
Oh, it's raining. Oh, she's fine, here with Jessica, they are here right now.
Yes, Jessica is enormous.
No, she is my size.
No, listen, she is really big, right?
Yes, she is big already. She is coming to visit next year
Oh, how good. Listen, and when do you come?
Oh, I don't know, Camenci- I don't know, it depends.
It depends on the work. And what did they tell you in your work. Nothing, to wait
Yes. Ah. To wait. But, mm, what else? what else? let me see, let me see
Tell more about your job. Listen, what are you working on now?
Oh, I have an interview on Wednesday, they will send me the passages to fly to Texas
I see
There it is a very big consulting company that works with, so I hope --
Oh, monster!
You don´t know how much I am praying to be contracted by that company, listen, because they say that if they contract me --
Oh, of course.
besides training me, there is the possibility to go to work in Europe, then it would be
Damn, Mili, it must happens, it must happens, it must happens,it must happens, it must happens,it must happens, it must happens, please it must happens --
Great, Carmenza, have you goner to church?
No, I have not gone.
Neither do I, time ago.
Ah, listen, Mili, hopefully you get it, please, it would be excellent, excellent, excellent --
Imagine, imagine, I don't know, I am a little, well.
You don´t know how much I would like, ah.
What else can I tell you, here --
Listen, and which part of Europe.
They don't know, any place.
Listen, hopefully I have the visa before you go to Europe.
It is not for sure, Carmen, so still --
Yes no, ah, I am, remembering, that my aunt wanted to go with her child, with Alejandro, she wants to go, so, on vacations, she wants Alejandro to be there for more or least two months --
Did she planned on February? Hmm.
And so, because she wants her son to speak English, she is obsessed with that. She says that maybe in two months he could do it. And so, she told me to tell you, if you could find out, how much will cost a room or some place for her to stay --
Hmm.
to stay.
How long? for two months?
No, a hostel or a room, something like this. Yes, for two months
For two months is quite difficult, ah, but I'll find out, because most are rented for seven minimum, but let me check out and I'll find out if there is another option
I see. Or someone who can, I don't know, who can host you, or those hostels, but, can you stay in a hostel for two months?
Oh, yes, right, aha, I think you can, but since he is little, how old is he?
Let's see how much it would cost, more or less. Alejandro is seven now
Since he is a little boy, maybe, the only option for him is to go study at some school, because, I mean --
Oh, he said that, he said he wanted that, to go to some school to study
It is the only option, because from sixteen above there are classes of English, just English --
I see
but if they are under sixteen, they have to go to school, it is the law --
They have to --
I mean, besides they teach him, I think it is much better, because he will stay all day with other boys there
Oh, I see, then it would be more convenient for him, wouldn't it? then he could go to school
It is the law. Anyone can go to school. No matter if he is American or not, any kid under sixteen must go to school
Oh, I see. Yes, even if you are a tourist? Oh, I can't believe it, how cool, I will tell him, then
Mmm. So, even if you are a tourist. Mmmm. If you are staying for some months, right? Let me find out that
How cool, right?
Let me find out that in the school, let's see what they say
Sure, 'musto'. Mmmm
Mm. How many years? Six, no?
Seven, seven, seven, seven.
Has six? Seven, seven, okay, seven, seven. Okay.
Seven, will go to second grade. Next year will be in second grade.
Okay. And what else do I tell you, And, Carmen, how are you
Fine. How's your love life, tell me.
Ah, nothing. I'm worried, I'm very worried because I'm trying --
Why, because of your love life?
No, because of my job now I'm like this, but -- The only thing, listen, Jessica is here, say Hi to Jessica for a bit, ah, she left already, she doesn't want to know anything, well you are not going to say hi?
Okay. Ah, why, because she knows that this call will be
hello, just Well, she doesn't want to. The only, the only thing that worries me now, is finding that job, and the truth is that I'm
Mm. Listen, you want me to tell your grandma something?
Listen, yes, no, don't tell her anything because she's going to say how come I haven't called her and I've called you, we are already going to call her later.
Ah, okay, Listen, where are they going to pass this call, under what sponsorship, who has requested it, who
The, no, they are doing it, is the University of Pennsylvania that's doing the recordings of the most important languages of the world --
Okay.
and then you tell them that you want to call and they send you, they send a number, a code, that you can enter and already well, they give you fifteen minutes --
how crazy!
But it is recorded, and that they can record for scientific purposes and be published
Well, I think we are telling each other very interesting, right?
] No, well good, I don't know what else to say, I'm going through this, let's see, what more can I tell you, what more can I tell you.
Yes?  Well, I can tell you, I will tell you that, do you remember this kid, Kike's friend?
Ah yes, what happened with him?
Who called me last year and I didn't go to meet --
Aha.
he's calling me again.  Just yesterday, he called me --
And, so, how is he, huh?
and nothing, I don't even know him, you know, we talk on the phone --
Hmm.
yeah and it's always, hey, and when are we going to meet, and everything, the first time he called me a few hours before and I said, my grandmother is sick, I can't, please, I'm sorry.
Blah!
He called me again and told me, let's go out Saturday and I said yeah, perfect, he told me, I'm calling you Friday to figure out the hour for Saturday, and the monster didn't call.  From there I --
And you would have gone out, I bet you wouldn't have gone out --
No, yes, I was going to go out with him, what's wrong with it, he's a friend, what does it matter --
Hmm.
And so one of the many.  So yesterday he called me and he said, hey, let's go out the Saturday, when we'll I meet you, well we'll meet, because I don't know him either.
But you don't have any idea what he's like.
yes, I've seen him, but you know that, really vaguely, a little bit, that's it.
But it seems like he looked good to you, and that he's stuck with you, no?
N- this is what Kike said to me, but he said to me, do you remember that day of the barbecue?
Yes, uff, that was years ago.
I know, that's where he, he met me, he met me there and that's when he asked Kike about me.

Mm
And, he's charging four hundred thirty dollars
And, it's so-so
Well yes, it's so-so
I mean, the rent for the place
Is that they are very expensive the rents here and right now I just finished seeing another one and what happens is that, well, I just got in here and I wouldn't want to move, because the guy is, is a nice person, he lives, right now he's alone, but
He just got divorced and has a boy
Mm
He's like eight years old
Mm
He's not here, right now he's with his mom eh
The boy?
The boy, and, and I tell you that well just because of that, I feel bad, but
he's going to work there, Tuesdays and Thursdays, like today, for example.
Yes.
he's going to work from, from four thirty until the time the store closes, mm
Okay.
he's going to work two days there, he's going to keep working two days, eh, because
How nice, and How's Orlando doing?
well, so-so, mom, because he doesn't have a permanent job yet
Okay
but he has been working all the time
Ah, how nice.
yes, he's been working, of course they are temporary jobs, of three months, one month, something like that, you understand me?
Okay.
but, he's been working all the time, but, is that it's very
Ah, that's good, that's good, yes.
it's very hard
we were, very, very worried here, not knowing if he was working or not, or how he was doing.
Yes, yes, no yes, he has been working all the time, of course that is not the same, well mom, imagine, because
Sure
to start, we have no medical insurance, ah
Ah.
and this is terrible, not having medical insurance.
Sure.
So, just the remedies cost an absurdity, from what I know,
Ah.
and I don't know, if you can't even go to the doctor because the costs are so gigantic, that then, with many things, you have to simply rise about it, that's it.
This is what happens to us here too, well Cheli.
So, no-
The medicines are so expensive
No, there's nothing you can do, well, mom, what can you do.  The economic situation is very bad here, very, very bad, ah, ah.
Look, here, here in Chile, also Cheli, the economic situation is really bad.
Yes.  Yes, there are millions of people--
There isn't employment!
No, there's not employment.  Yes, this is what there is, that, because before anything, they've closed - many banks, many companies, mom, they've closed.
Hmm.
It's something incredible, there have been millions of people left without employment.
My God!
So, the, and then, mom, with the modern machines that they have today --
Yes.
the computers are so fantastic, that they do the work of twenty five people, or more.
Yeah.
Then, then, each day there is less work, well mom, because machines does all, well.
Of course, of course.
Hmm.
It is like that, my daughter.
The technology is so advanced that then, have displaced people from their jobs. The thing is like that.
Listen, daughter.
Yes?
patience
Mommy, until -
Eh, I understand the situation because it is also like that here.
of course.
See, eh, yesterday in the morning Eddie was here.
Ah, how good! and how is my son?
Yes. Fine. He is very well. he was very happy.
Yes?
I ask him a lot, I, how he was and he says that, he is very well, that they are happy.
Ah, how
He was with another young man, because
Ah, with other.
his mates are changed every now and then.
Yes, yes, they change. So that, now she has a new one?
So that, Now she was with a -- Yes, she has a new one, that is a young man from Concepcion.
Ah, yeah, yeah, yes, I already know about that.
So that -- Ah.
Yes, his last name is Castro.
Ah?
his last name is Castro.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah. Yes, I knew about that that she had that partner. I thought that she had changed to another one, another one.
No. No, no. That one, Castro.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
So she came with him, they had breakfast here --
Ah.
from here they were going to Graciela's place and the I don't, I don't know where, for his work they were going somewhere else.
Yes, Yeah. But he looks good.
He  looks very good. Ah?
He looks good, he looks good I sa-
Good, good. He looks, he's  bit thinner.
Yeah.
Because when he came, he was fairly fat.
Okay.
But now he's a little thinner and he looks very good.
How nice, that
And sure, that he has, has to lose weight because, the walks that he takes every day
Yes, well. And, and also he doesn't eat as much as he ate here, so, mom.
Sure.
Ah? and here he would just go in car, everywhere, so, and not over there, so, then, eh.
Sure. Yes, but he says that where he's at, the pension is really good, that the food is really good and abundant, so on that side, it's good.
How nice, how nice, mom.
Yes.
It's a tranquility, like that, so.
Sure, all
Because he, he, he writes some very nice letters, but says very little, mom, of how he is, so to speak.
Yes. I told him, Yes.
I mean, he just says, that he's fine, but he doesn't send details, you understand?
Okay.
We don't even know where he lives, nor with whom. Nothing, so. listen. Mm
Sure, now they are in -- before he was by here in a neighborhood by here, Macul
Yes. yes, but
now he's in Recoleta.
over there by Recoleta, yes, by Recoleta, yes, that's what he told me. Well, what matters is that he's fine, mom.
Yes, he's fine.
I'm glad you went to see him, because, where, since they change him, then already, it's harder for him to go visit you, Mm. That's the problem
Yes.
that he already can't get out of his area.
Yes, but, they have a free day, Cheli, eh, eh
Yes, but anyway. Even if he has his day
Ah, sure, well.
they can't leave the, the area they've been assigned to.
Sure, sure.
Mm. Then, probably to go, now, to your house -- he has to ask for special permission, see?
Yes, that's what I think, also.
Yes, because otherwise, maybe he would go, do you remember that before he used to go more often?
Yes
Because he was in the area. Not now.
Sure.
Not now, now then, he can't anymore
Yes, now it's farther.
Sure. Now he can't get out of where he is. see? That's why. Eh, he probably has to ask for permission, or something like that, to go see you guys.
And, mom, eh, since I'm calling with these calls from there from Margarita's office
Really?
that stay recorded, so, listen.
Ah.
So, so, it's good, because - eh, I was going to call you on the weekend, but it turned out that - that later, Margarita told me that I could call with this system
so then, well, I'm taking advantage of talking now, and, and, how eh
Ah, how nice.

Look, your dad is fine, in general, he also suffers from his leg that with eh, that it gets heavy and he can't walk much. He doesn't walk much, no.
Okay.
But he's fine, he maintains himself more or less good.
Okay.
Now he has been suffering with the teeth, that he goes to the dentist

Poor him! He has problems with his teeth all the time, my dad!
Yes, always.
Poor him! Ah Ah! What a shame! Yes, here, look I, I'm always here taking care of the kids, mom
Really?

Sure, I can imagine.
I'm super busy, but also that gives me some cash, mom, and we need it, well, so
Sure! sure, I understand.
so, so in that, I spend it taking care of the kids and -- and well, and since I'm so alone all the time, because look, Orlando is never here
and Myriam, much less. I never see Myriam, so listen.
Sure, no, so the kids are good to keep you company and distract you.
So, when the kids leave or the days they don't come and I don't know -- I spend it, that I'm extremely lonely, mm.
Sure, poor my child.
So that's terrible, being alone, so listen. So there I distract myself sewing, I don't know. I made covers here, for the furniture of, I don't know if, I think I told you in the letter, I don't remember.
No.
I made covers here for the furniture of -- but they came out, mom, like new.

Sure, sure.
So, making things --
Sure.
for Myriam, or whatever, for me.  So then
and, and is Myriam happy with what she's doing, and everything?
Yes, she's happy because, look, since in reality she doesn't have experience, well, mom, to work in Psychology --
Right!
so here, they're giving her a lot of experience, well, working here in a school, yeah?  So, and at the same time, since she's studying to get the --
sure, and now the studies, I think, are going to go a bit more slowly, well, since she will get married -- then --
she's really excited
Well, but it's also, it's also the age, well, mom, she's older, yeah, well.
Yes, sure, sure.
You know, and she's missing the train, well.  Ah.  Thinking, well, here they get married really young, then, hey.  Ah, so --
Yes.
and that's good that she's getting married and thinking about having her life, also, well, mom.  She's also studied like crazy and worked --
Hey, the boyfriend, the boyfriend, does he study or work?
Yes, he studies and works too, he's a young one.

Yeah.
All week end, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday -- and then, after, he goes to school, every day during the week --
Yeah.
in the day.  He goes to classes all day.
And, he's happy with this?
Well, it's the only way that he can study and work, well, mom, ah?
Sure.
Because I couldn't work and study and the same time, well, if not, what time do you go to sleep.
yes, I would take them here in Dallas, to different places
Ah, look how fabulous
where they could then take notes and
Sure
and present them there
Sure
so is that since here in Fort Worth, for example, that of the Cowboys, all that sector there, which is so nice
Sure
here that of Kennedy and other places were, I was one day like til one in the morning with them in the nightclub that they also wanted to see how it was the
the life
the nightlife here in Dallas
sure
for the fourth of July I took them to a parade
Ah, look how
in a neighborhood, there
how interesting, yes
Yes, and then we went to the rodeo and also eh, we were in the center also, because here there's a system of buses that operate only in the center and they are free
ah
to clear up the traffic
sure
and the people leave their
their car and
their car, sure and take their bus because in Chile they had a problem now that the, the taxi drivers cannot enter
the center of the city
the center of the city
sure
sure, then they used a front man to be able to enter, then and be able to take passengers, so
sure
I mean, they would ask any person, like they were going to leave them in some place there in the center and it was just to get in there
sure
so, they were doing a big report
no well, it was a very interesting and nice job, right?
sure
sure
and also of the ones of the roads here, I also took them there are paid roads, because in Chile they are also going to start with that system of the paid roads, well, there are some, ah
sure, yes
in which you pay a toll
ah no, here in Mexico they are all paid
then, I also took them to those and
and then now they invented a dollar system I mean, all the money that they collect from the toll from here to Cuernavaca, for example they are going to convert to dollars and they are going to invest it, I think, in foreign companies
Okay
something like that I was reading, it already started with Cuernavaca, yes eh
sure, that that also eh, when I took them here they also told them that here in the department that builds the tolls
sure
they also invest the money in the Stock market and then they just, take out the interest and with that they are paying the people and doing the repairs that are required
sure
the system is very interesting
sure
Mm. Listen and

Well, and, ¿didn't you let, didn't you let the dog there?
Mmm. Now, it's expensive in here.
Yes, no, two hundred dollars.
The cost aren't, hello, sure, kind of.
Two hundred dollars per product.
Exactly, I mean, it's not that cheap.
I already have all the information here, the lab just send it to me, they are desperate because they want to go into Chile but, they  said that if the have to do all that, they won't do it
Fine, it depends on, I mean, maybe this issue goes off, it's like, what's the name
Mmm. Fine, look, that issue, no no no no it doesn't make sense. I have the information to sell fish here, it's tough, really tough.
Why, hey.
because of the companies, the easier way for the fish to come here is if it's already canned.
Canned?
No, it has, the company has to be registered here in the FDA of the United States.
Yes, I was just going to say that, exactly, we were going to tell you
I see, and and, and, yes?
We have to look for a company that has already introduced the products in there
Sure.
and of course, I was going to tell you, look, I have a representative in there
Sure. Fine, I'm telling you that I've already found out and I'm using this call to tell you this because they are paying me for this phone call, I wanted to tell you about that before it all gets ugly, okay?
I see,
and now, one more thing, look, whats the status of this ISI matter? You know what ISI is right?
Yes, a
Well, how's that matter.
Look
Sell, not sell, they are broke, they are not broke, what.
They sell.
A lot?
A lot.
Chucha. I'm going to tell you why, it turns out that these of ISI were the ones who were trying to come to an agreement with, with the ones from ACE from here, okay?
Okay
and Roberto Pedroza, a eh, a Venezuelan that I know who just called me this morning -- told me that, that if you were in the matter of construction materials
if it interests you eh, to become a representative, a distributor of theirs -- but what they want is not just representative distributor, what they want is that
there are places with the name of ACE
Okay
Okay, how much is it to get in. One thousand dollars.
A thousand?
It cost one thousand dollars to say, okay, for each place I'm going to put, I'm going to pay one thousand dollars.
But that's a mere trifle!
Okay. But of course it is super cheap, so. But it turns out there's a problem and it's that they have the things that you have to put in the place
you need to have a place according to their eh, their specifications, or what the place needs to have, you have to open a line of credit for five hundred thousand dollars, open
Mm.
okay, there are a bunch of things that, that, that you have to see them, okay?
Yes.
and you have to send a letter of intention, and I'm going to tell you right now so that I don't forget, you would have to send a letter in Spanish, only, to ACE, write this down. ACE A C E
A C E yes?
ACE, like in English, it's written H A R D W A R E

in opening Ace stores, in Chile.
Fine. Okay.
And that you need information urgently.
Okay.
Okay, you give him your business's information, you tell him what you want, and that you need pamphlets and information. Okay?
Okay.
After they receive this, they will review it, and this man will review it and he will send you an information package.
of information, okay
Write down that if he wants to talk with me in the United States
Okay
To call me at my phone, tell him that you, that you have a representative in the United States put it like that, I have my representative in the United States and his name is Edmundo Munoz
Yes, Okay.
Ah, and the telephone, two one four, two seven nine, three nine two five, okay, so that the guy, if he has any information, he gives it to me quickly.
Okay, Okay. Okay.
Okay? I don't know how that idea sounds to you.
It's very, it's very  magnificent, but
Sure,
but it's better to receive the information.
At least, well hey, at least
Lets see what we can do, maybe we'll get something, or someone might do more here.
I see well, what else do I have to tell you, oh?
Hey Edmundo. I see, just tell me.
No well, I don't know what else to say, that's why I wanted to call you, to see if you had received the fax, oh?
the call, what's this call about.
How?
What, what's this call about, what is this call about, what are they taping.
Oh, they are doing something with computers, okay, I mean, they are starting to, they are starting to develop a system in which you don't have to dial numbers, you just talk to the computer and the computer would be able to recognize your voice.
so, this tape, no, you don't care, they don't care what we talk about, they are going to take some phrases, certain words and put them into the computer and they will see if the computer can write them.
so, that's what they are doing, they called me last night, a friend from Chile and she told me, would you like to call Chile for fifteen minutes, for free? Yes, well, what's about and she told me.
I see.
so, that's what's going on, here the computers are just starting with this typing thing and the computers write everything except what you said because they can't recognize the voices, so, they have more or less, the English part done and now they are working in Spanish.
Perfect. Oh, that's great, congratulations, I see, brother.
Oh, okay. So this has nothing to do with me, I'm just helping them, that's it.
No, yes, that's fine. Hey, oh.
Fine. Hey, how's my old mam.
Fine, how have you been, tell me what has happened to you.
It's been shit, shit, oh, bad, bad, bad, oh?
Nothing happened -- just like that? nothing happened with that people?
No, mm, look I have to call next week, to this people from Latin America next week, I'm seeing that it's gonna take long, so --
I see
I don't know what will happen, I have no idea. These spanish.., I went to the meeting with them, I didn't tell you in the letter, in the fax I sent you because I thought just a couple of things --
I see
so I was in the meeting with them, right?, they said what we are doing in the United States is not good, and I asked them, what else do you want us to do? we need money here, we need to do this, no, no, no, because I know companies that are selling, tell me the name of those companies --
And one of them, one of the partners, told me, that company, can you believe that two days after that I am reviewing my papers and that company appears being --
being represented by one of the biggest representation companies in the United States, that are at twenty per year and sell everywhere,
They had, they had to shut up then. Edmundo is right, no, it's not like this. They don't want to put money, they don't want to put money, absolutely.
then I don't know what will happen, now, now is Chicago's Fair in November -- and let's see what happens in the Fair, because there will be a lot of people, but let's see if we are able to sell, if this people don't want to do anything it's gonna be quite fucked up --
You know what I mean. So, well, that's, that's the point, I'm still thinking about it
Well. Alright, brother
I am waiting for someone from Chile to offer me a job for two million dollars a year,
Listen, you know what? you know what? you should come here --
And --
and we'll look at all the acc- look, the business right now is sewage waters treating, the --
I know, but there is an enormous company in Chile doing that, besides I know who they are
no, maybe you can enter --
Well
the other affair is, eh, everything related to environment, I mean --
Sure, okay.
Air purifiers, smoke purifiers
Okay.
those things are, are strong here and the future
Okay.
at this moment, I tell you, you invest that, maybe you waste time, but
With.
all those co- ah?
You waste a lot of time.
Sure.
And I'm going to tell you one thing, if you, if you tell me, you would have to come, yes, I go, but and then I have to be constantly coming over here, if things are not done over there, they are done here.
Sure, you have to
when, unless the people go and tell you what it is they need, but you have to be looking here.
Yes.
in what, what could you and I talk about in that aspect. Do, you are going to do a work plan, are you going to do something for when I go, or what, or we are going to get on each others case only.
I really, I mean, what I tell you, if you want to bring cosmetic things, all those things
Sure, anyways, anyways

He didn't
and he said, he said that Tim Vidal was going to be the second vice president and he said, I didn't accept - yes, no way, because I didn't think it was good, right? and
Aha.
that, then now he's saying it, how, how he said it like so that the people know what type of, of , of
AHa.
versions she gives or what, how she denies something that she did, look, to make her look bad. Well, see
Well then, but Fujimori is worse, right? He never presented his sworn statement, right?
He never did anything, also he doesn't speak about his wife, what yes, this congresswoman, what's her name, Marta, what?
That's a very interesting topic to be recorded, right? Alan Garcia, the ex-president of Peru will be prosecuted? extradited?
Oh Javier, are they really taping this, no?
Aha.
Is it true that they are taping this? Look, today, he left in the morning without a known route, his lawyer, I mean, Del Castillo.
Aha. Aha.
Do you remember about Del Castillo, well.
Yes, del

Aha.
I don't know, but they've shown in the television this morning, graphology proofs, a series of things, I don't know, have you spoken?
Yes, there are proofs, I don't know.
But you know what, he's gone. So, that means that.
He's no longer in Colombia?
Who? No, he's gone, the lawyer!
I know but. Wasn't he aware of those documents? Are there any documents?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know but suddenly, he goes, they let him go.
But there are documents, real documents that could prove that Alan Garcia stole the money?
No, no, no, no.
No?
No, nothing like this, besides, according to them he didn't steal, what he did was to ask for participation, what the call a kickback --
Co- Commission -- Kickbacks, okay.
Commission, commission, yes.  Javi, tell me, you always have friends on the computer.
Yes, yes they write me --
You communicate with a lot of people?
Yes, yes.

You know that Randy, the one who was mine, is getting married tomorrow.
Don't tell me.
Yes, yesterday was his bachelor party, with a .
Ah.  How interesting.  How, how did she seem?
But I wasn't there.  And I preferred not to be, because, like I say, why would I be there -- if I can't have or see, only to watch and not to touch --
better if I went dancing.
Hey, shameless!
I went to dance better, it was worse to be in a problem later, right?
Who did you go with?
I went to a disco.
Ah, with whom.
Alone, I went to play, to play pool.
Ah, liar.
Well, but I preferred to do that, right?
Ah, and Tell me, how did the girl appear.
I don't know, I wasn't there.
Ah, they haven't told you. You don't tell each other anything, you are not like we talk about everything, we tell each other everything, Mm.
They say that she was federa-eh  - but what is it called, no is that I went like two years ago to Abraham's party, and that one was very professional
And? Ah.
Yes, and I think that all the money that she must've taken, she charged in Abraham's party like one hundred eighty dollars
Yes.
just for going two, just for going
For the presentation, yes, Ah? For going? How for going, what did they give her
but between all the money, but between all the money I saw passing there, it was easily more than seven hundred dollars
How incredible! In other words that they give as tip, the tip they give her.
Aha, aha,
But she was going to do the?
No, it's that you put it anywhere, and she takes it from you with her mouth --
Yes Ah! ], here they don't do this!
No, well.
Here, look, the boys, the boys for the bachelor parties, they're all scared and nervous, this costs seventy dollars.
Aha.
But almost no one puts any of these notes on them.  What are they going to put anywhere and then she takes it?
Ah, yes.
Ah, how advanced, my God.
What's it called, I remember where I went I was charged five dollars exactly, they put five, eh, cream cakes, hat come out in the, in the scenes --
Ah,
and you had to take out and pay five dollars.
Ah, hey!  Hey Javier, stop doing these things, ah.
well, this was two years ago, and I didn't want to be there, yesterday.
Javi and when are you going to send me photos, the ones you told me about, to see this fatty --

Right?

Ah, okay, what
And what else, what else have you known
Listen, Javi, but I haven't understood anything that they've said in that English, Jesus, Maria, and Jose.
Of what?
Wow! The English that they've spoken, that lady, that spoke before me.
Oh, no, nothing, nothing happens, is to legally protect themselves, in case something happened.
Javi, my aunt Alicia, yesterday was her birthday, she called me to invite us to lunch, she told me that -- You had called but that you never went again.
Mm
Why, what has happened. You didn't want to see her?
No, no.
She's here, she says she leaves in April or May of next year
Again. Well, now the situation is going to get really hard for all the illegal people
Mm.
What do you call it, they've come out with a new law that they will be able to verify all the documents from here, now the, ah.
Ah, okay. Javi, and what can you tell me about Fidel Castro.
What has happened.
He is angry because they receive there the, the Cubans and give them work and all, but the rest of us have the doors closed --
And to encourage the exodus, of, of the people that are talking bad about the --
Aha.
he says that they let the Cubans get in, and then has threatened to let everyone, everyone who wants --
Hmm.
Imagine.
I think that it is okay
How do you see it, then the island will be empty -- Ah?
No, because there are documentaries, so, I have seen in the news -- that people, it is true that they complain, but there is also people that say that they are going to defend the revolution to any cost --
Ah, yeah, How come?
Do you have the picture, the one I am with him?
No, you are not with him, he carried you, he carried you when you were e baby, the brother, the --
I, he is not carrying me? ah, it was the brother, but you do have it Could you send it to me? can it be a copy?
Yes, yes It is a newspaper clipping.
oh, but send me a copy, right?
Yeah.
The history will also judge me. That one, that one yes send me it. Who, who has it?
Your dad.
Oh, I am going to ask him. If he has it, right?
Mm. What, they do those studies? They talk about?
No, I, I, I read, you can find information on whatever you want, right?
Ah.
I, do read about things like that - but and, what happens with Montecinos, for example, with the spy, with the spy! with the CIA agent
I don't know, I don't know him.
Vladimiro
Vladimiro Montecinos
The presidential adviser
Ah, I don't know anything about him, at all, -- he doesn't appear in any, any activity, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Ah.
At all, nobody knows him, nobody knows of him, nobody knows what he devotes himself to nor what he does, nor anything, see? then
And, have you sent me the letter that appeared in Caretas?
Your dad is sending you quite a lot of magazines, it's there, probably the magazine too.
Walter is going to send me magazines, but I hadn't see the Caretas where I had written.
Ah, when
Like two days ago.
Ah, okay.
I'm looking for a place to move.
Why
Perhaps because I'm paying like three hundred dollars in rent, ah.
Ah, okay.
It's very expensive.
Javi, the one who's there is Doris.
Ah.
She asked me for your phone and I forgot to give it to her, to talk to you, You, don't know Concourt?
Ah. No, no, no.
You don't it? She goes there like two or three months.
But is --
You want me to send her your address?
Is by where Javier lives. Is by where he lives, yes, yes, what is it called --
Which Javier?
Lisener.
Ah, and, you already saw him?
No, but I've talked with him.
.
Is that he lives like three or four hours away, and I can't go.
Ah, okay. What does he tell you, that he wants to stay there.
He's already going to stay.
Ah, he has liked it, right? Ah.
it might probably be on the, let me save a bit more, probably by the end of the next month I will be sending her to have her surgery, she had headaches so, the geriatrician told me that I should take her to the oculist.
I took her to Opeluche, it's a center that fights against blindness and one of the top places where they can do surgery on her and I'll bring her home on the same day.
because if I send her to the Insurance, what will happen is that
why are they doing surgery on her, mom, what's wrong with her
because, the doctor, her sight, she didn't have surgery on that
the cataracts?
she can't see, yes
I see
she can't see so, it grew back in her eye
that had already had surgery?
that had already had surgery on, exactly
and so
so, they have to perform another surgery and insert an ocular lens that she didn't have before because when she first had surgery
the interocular lens was not used
mom but how is her health?
I see
I mean, do you remember that she had some problems with the anesthesia, the last time?
exactly, yes, I'm checking all of that, we are checking with Raul and we are looking for different opinions, but the reality is one, Edmundo, I've always been against it because of her age.
and I thought that we shouldn't take the risk but what is happening is that we never know when we'll day and I don't know if I might someday not be able to take care of my mom
and she's going to be blind, so, I think it's a risk we should take, Raul told me to write to you, oh
I was trying to get another different medical opinion to see if it was feasible
eh, the age, mom, the age is a problem
yes the age is a problem, and also the problem would be, Edmundo, what would happen with your grandmother if something happened to me and she stays totally blind
mom, but later I'll call you again then, now yes
is something, I'm going to explain to you in a letter, all the details of what the doctors are telling me, I mean
Okay
first they say, they think, that they have to operate to increase the vision, you know that for her is essential to have good vision because if not she always gets desperate and for any thing she
says I can't see, I can't see, I can't see
Mm
Okay, then eh, her blood pressure has practically been dealt with and it's already, it's normal remember that I told you she had her blood pressure high
Yes
well, it's already been stabilized, with the treatment they did with the Notropil also everything has, let's say, regarding her memory has improved a lot
Okay
for me it's very important that she recognizes people well
she didn't recognize?
ah no, I wrote to you, right? I wrote to you that there were moments that she said that I was
Ah
that I was her granddaughter, right?
Mm, okay
okay, that I, I was your sister
I know, I know
no, and I would have died long time ago then, eh, if now this treatment with Notropoli for eight weeks has given a good result
and she has improved a lot, then why not give her a chance, right? we have a chance because, eh, here in Opeluce that is the, eh, Deni must know
it is in Arequipa avenue, in the block eighteen, the center where the guarantee that I must operate the eye that was not operated in first instance
and then, after about two or three months, operate the other eye
I see, I see
I will detail it all in a letter that I will send you on Monday, I will send you the letter on Monday
alright, mom
with all the details
Mmm
alright, shall I pass you over to grandma?
if we have time, yes
alright
well, we agree you have to tell me better, I will try to call again because I want to talk more thoroughly about that, unless grandma is beside you
yes, she is here, beside me, ok?
alright, hurry up, then
now, quickly, say hello

I've already explained to you
no, you, how have you been
me, here like, I'm there I'm there, there I go, son
are you going to the doctor to get checked?
no, I haven't gone
and why not, why not
Ah
you have to also fix your health, remember
that I can't go out, when I go out for a little bit, my mom's left alone, she despairs a lot
but take her, well, what can you do
no, she can't, because she's, let's say to- yeah
Mom, I will be your helper, here by your side, like your daughter
and yes, it's good
I hope that it happens, they did
huh?
it's, it's good, but you know what happens, to tell you, she won't get into the office, they don't let her in, she will wait outside
Yeah
of the office and she will despair, like, she can't stay alone anywhere because she thinks that
if you want to talk to the doctor about something, then, you can't
exactly, no, you can't, let's say to have him see her, I go to where the doctor is, but if they will examine me, the doctor will say, what is this woman doing here
yeah
you know
I understand
it's really difficult, really difficult to, what's it called, for me to go out, now yes, I go out sometimes, I go to the cemetery to see your dad, I come back and I find her crying
she despairs a lot
aha
she, no, no, she doesn't like to be alone, she gets exasperated if she doesn't see me, and sometimes I am in the kitchen and she is here in the room, and she hasn't seen me for a while, or I have been washing, I have been inside and
'I thought you had left', I mean, she gets exasperated, she becomes anxious, you know what I mean?
Yes
that's why I, I hardly go out
Does Mrs Marcelina still go there or not any more?
yes she does, she is here at home
oh, that relieves you a little work, then
yes, she's here in the house, yes, that part works pretty good, even she tells me sometimes, 'just go out Mistress, if you have to go out there is no problem', but the situation is another one with

yes, I know he is a little drunk, I noticed it, listen darling, take care my love, will you?
Mmmm my doll
tell the kid that I would have liked to call him tomorrow to say hello, but well, it was more interesting to talk to you, but don't tell him it was more interesting because he'd die
no, no, thanks
tell my dear that I love him a lot, okay?
Yes
tell him that I know there's a lot of things that happen in his job but not to worry, to please think about his health, okay?
okay, mom, later I'll tell you, maybe I'll sell the car and do wonders with the profit. okay?
do whatever you want, remember that it's yours, whatever you want
what I want good, mom
but always think with the head and not with the heart, honey okay?
ah precisely what I'm doing
I think with the head
today I went to Adirobi and everything is in order
perfect
but I have to wait three months so that everything comes out in order, okay, doll
okay, mom, wait the time and do the most convenient thing keep talking because they still don't tell us anything, until they tell us this call will be cut and you have a minute left, at that moment there's a minute left
okay?
well treasure
well, what do you want me to tell you, I'm going to register in my classes, again, of Aikido
ah,
still, since last year I withdrew from Aikido, this year I'm not withdrawing, this year I continue with my Aikido classes, so you are already going to see me when I arrive there in Peru I'm going to practice with you, honey, okay?
with me
sure, you have to learn
thanks, honey, but you know that I have to put something in front of me to protect myself from you
no, mom
because you know that the
why, what have you done
no, because I'm referring to a karatazo, so I only see that you're coming to pounce on me
no.  No, no mom, no, the issue is different, you don't have to attack, you have to defend yourself because this art says that it's self defense.
ah
if you attack and
but we're too far for defense, honey
no, you know that I love you, fatty
the defense for now has to mature
yeah
God and destiny has put an enormous distance between us for the moment.  Denise please, I ask you
yes mom, yes mom
that you don't abuse Edmundo and when you practice I imagine that you fall a lot
don't think that, ah, the bear, I tickle him, and disarm the bear
Don't get panicked, eh
Yeah mom
he does this because he's a guy, because he's a really really great man, really really polite
enough baby girl
but, do not take advantage because he is your husband.
no, no, no I don´t take advantage because he has the belt
Aikido es Aikido, Oh
Mother, he has the green belt.
Aikido is Aikido what about you?
Edmundo
you or him, Edmundo
he, he has a green belt
I thought he had the black belt, ok.
no, no, no, he did not take anymore classes when he came to the usa, when we come back we will do everything we have to do
okay
my family is your family, Edmundo´s family its also our family
of course

Mom, it has been confirm the tickets are separated, we don´t have to pay anymore.
great
and we arrive to Peru on twenty-fourth by night, no let me confirm that, because we leave here on twenty-fourth and get there on twenty-fifth early morning to Peru
fine, my treasure
I know you will spend Christmas waiting for us, my love]
don't worry, don't worry, I'll wait for you to decorate the Christmas tree yourself, outside, because I have placed it outside
but, you know what?, there is a problem,  I don't know if the sell will take place soon
I see
and I don't know where will Jesus be born or where will I receive you, the thing is that I have to receive somewhere in Peru
Of course yes
but there is a place, but there is a thing here in Peru, it stands out a mile
what is it?
you have left a terrible void
oh, mommy, forget it
you know what I mean, all the girls, well I'd better not say it
Yes
the girls you had, I can't say any more
yes, well
because it is something, it is something I can't tell
alright, don't say it
yes, so,I mean all you girlfriends miss you so much, absolutely, so much, mommy
tell them I love them a lot, and that if I forget to write to them is because I am really working, I am trying to study here, mommy
I see
that's great doll, my treasure
Look how it could've been that I sent it
Yes
And it was returned because I hadn't put a stamp
Ah
I mean that in some way I didn't want to send it to you, I didn't want I mean I wanted to send it but there was a problem with this letter
yes
And I keep going around, and you know that I doubted, and was saying, but well I just thought like that
Yes
understand? then I said why just
Yes
sent it to you, if I tell you all that I think, if in reality
eh?
I don't know, it's an idea that it's a process is what I think, it has nothing to do, I mix the reality perhaps
Yes
But I thought that well, that I had to say what is that that
Ah okay but you know what happens Marcia, sometimes things, one has to be I know that you do it in the best way In no way do I think that there's, there's any type of bad intention
On the contrary, on the contrary
I know that on the contrary but see that there are certain things, that in certain moments can be very painful, then receiving that letter in, in that moment
It hurt me, you know?
Yes
Yes, of course it hurt be because it's like, this month you left for a few days and it was an eternity to me.
Yes
because of all the things that have happened, it doesn't seem to me that, oh, it seemed to me that you had left for a month and it hasn't even been a month since I left Enrique
Yes
So, it seems like an eternity
Yes
You see? Lots of things have happened
Yes
Lots of things, so, I'm telling you, they were tough things but I'm not surprised anymore, life is like that
Yes
And maybe if someone is by your side, you can live some things but then he's like, this woman has lots of problems
Yes
Do you understand? I'm sorry, because of the tape, "pedo" means, it's a typical Argentinian expression
Oh, oh, fine, fine, but, what happened, what happened with that letter, did it make you
And
just the voice, why, do you think it has nothing to do with it?
Sure, did you see, I think it was tough
Yes
And it's true, what you think, what do I know, it's tough and to have to say that to someone, you know, it's all very recent
And did you see, it is tough because of the timing, because of the things I've been going through.
Yes
That it's not easy, it's not easy at all because you have to carry not only with all the, the tremendous things that happen on the inside and also carry with, with all the issue of the kids, see? because the kids are not well
No, how are they?
No,no they are not well at all, eh Arci is very sad, See he's with, in general very, very depressed
Yes
Maria said basically every night she's with, today her head hurts, or he back hurts, or you see she gets like contractions
Mm
Apparently the one who's handling things the best is Maria Delfina
Yes
But in reality when the night arrives, you see she's always that this is happening to her
Yes
Eh, then being, see, there are million of things that have happened, my father-in-law has called me well my ex-father-in-law to talk with me, that it's incredible the things they've told me, see?
I don't know, see, so many things have happened Marcela, that as to write, kind of like a book, I can assure you
Yes
Then
No girl, look Maricho, it gives you, it gives you and I'll make it short because there must be like five minutes left, girl I tell you Girl is something that, that let's say I feel, that I felt, not that I felt, that I feel like that
what happens
Mm
because sure one there from the outside, obviously I live the things totally and more here, I mean everything out of I mean like time also, because even as you say it's been more than, it's been a month but it seems like years perhaps
Yes
So, I'm totally out of time and place, like the
Yes
For me what's ok, and why I want you to stay calm, is that really if I, I send you this card because my intention was good and because it was
so you were up to date on what I was thinking and about what was true or not, seeing a
Hmm
You, we think, I mean, you also have an opinion in my life, like you see, like happens in a relationship, like how we have one of your opinions, after
Hmm
this is the other, to say, well it's true or not, look, you went to mambo totally, in a moment you can see if it's like this or not
but
Yes
let's not say that the intention really, like, wasn't about anything, to damage, or to screw around, on the contrary,
No, no, it's that
on the contrary, you, I know that you know me
I know that, look, it seems that
And I understand what you're telling me and
I could inspire ] absolutely
I thank you for telling me, because well, suddenly, well, I'm going to be more careful, but I also don't want to send you a card or whatever, I don't also want to have a relationship with you that's fictitious, you know, because, No!
Yes
because it wouldn't be a relationship.  Like, I like the relationship that we have.
Yes
and well, it hurts, some things hurt
Yes. Mmm.
and you are going through a moment and it's fucked up to have to listen to some things and and I, well, I might have been out of place and well, but
I tried to do good and I really, all I want is for you to be okay and well, the boys will be okay if
Yes
you do the things you have to do during your mourning time, okay?
Sure, sure
you should go through it now, because what was happening was that you, maybe that looked good, or as you say, the kids look fine but it's not normal for them to be like that
when that has happened
Yes
and it's painful what they are going through, if you are breaking up, if you broke up
Yes
it's not a joke
No, no, but, obviously, when you were here, Enrique was still home
But. Yes, no, and it was the beginning yes
but Carlos, nothing, sure, it was fucked up when he started drinking, and his father left home
he's living in a different house, they don't have their dad with them everyday
And mmm
so, yes, they really started to realize what it was to have divorced parents, do you understand?
Yes
so starting from there, a series of things between them started to happen
Yes
that have been and are very strong and if I fall all of a sudden, what do I know, eh
sure because also you're not like for, I mean there each one is going through their own, so it's difficult also to stand strong
sure it's, it's because of that that sometimes it becomes too much of an uphill battle
Yes
yes well, get a move on to be fine with them
Yes
to be able to be a support
Yes
and one becomes a load if not
no, on the contrary
eh, something in this moment I have to be a support, see
Yes, yes
there are times in which I really, they are good mates, they are phenomenal but, logically, they're boys, see in
Yes
so Mmm now the one that has to have the balls well put it's me, the balls means understood the willpower
oh Mari!
see?
and how is Enrique doing? do you speak among you, you see each other, speak
Yes, no look, luckily the other of the things that we posed from the start And that has been working out good is the fact of, of this not becoming the war of the roses
Eh
Eh, because it would be unfortunate for everybody
Yes
and for everybody in general right? and well thanks to that I tell you that we talk, like we've never talked or at least since a long time
Yes
we have a dialogue that I can tell you, that sometimes not known to me Eh I don't know, look, there are many
yes the
there are many changes you know
Yes
Eh I tell you, we talk on the phone, by there, hours, today I got the telephone bill that you know what's terrible, because we talk on the phone a lot
Yes.
it is, Enrique is a lot with the children, he comes to take them to school He comes home and see yeah, to drink, or we go out to have a coffee
and we chat, see
Yes
I don´t know, a dialogue that, like I say to you, that is very
Well
positive, because well it causes that we, see to really talk as At least, years ago that don´t
And yes because have to talk many things, it cannot between, so not ended, not ended, so things cannot be left that this there must talk about this right?
Surem sure, but I don't know  there was so much time that there was, there was so much violence
Yes
There was so many negative things
Yes
that, no, we did not listen to ourselves, we could not dialogue, and on the other side well this thing see, of being separate is like it has given us more freedom to, to could talk with
with more tranquility do you understand?
Yes
then we talked in a way of impressions that we did but centuries ago
Yes
Do you understand?
Yes
Eh then all this well, it is good for us
Of this time.
No, no, no
Then from here we are going by car to Canada, Maitin says it's like twenty six hours.

Put all your interest, put all your interest because that's the future, here I'm going to put Caro on, one moment
Here
Hello Male
Hello, little kid
Hello, how are you?
how have you been?
Well girl, Male doesn't write anymore nor anything
Ah God, that no!
Look
Last year my dad was like, I don't know, oh, I said no to him, I got bored of having to write to them to Costa Rica and none of them would write me back
Isn't that sad? But it's because you
They were making fun of me, right?
you were surrounded
they were laughing at me, while I was sending letters and letters and then not getting an answer
But you, but you didn't do that as much as I did
Look, listen, listen!
aha, aha
Look, listen, your punishment is now over
Why?
You are getting letters as of this week, okay?
Oh, I suppose so
They were five, five months in which
Look, tell Rodolfo that I got the ten pictures of the boy that he sent me, tell him
Ten, he sent you ten pictures
Is that a joke? He told me that he had sent them about two months ago, he told me
None!
tell him that
Look, Jenurrchito is big now, He's so bit! Everybody thinks that he's older than his age but look, I'm not lying, he's so tall now that he is almost at Rocio's hips now.
He's so big
and how is Armando, I mean, comparing him with the other boy
He's almost as tall as Eva Maria's son, almost as tall, no, I'm not exaggerating.
He's so tall. That boy is so tall!
And who did he take after?
He's wearing clothes for two year olds!
and who did he take after?
Oh, he's so cute, he has things from both but I think he got the best of the two
Really!
He has Rocio's nose and Rodolfo's eyes, Rodolfo's mouth and Rodolfo's body, he's cute.
And does he cry a lot?
No, no, he talks a lot, he starts talking to us since four in the morning, he screams.
Oh, he's going to be a priest when he grows up
since four in the morning, I believe so, he's going to be a priest
He was born a speaker!
whoever hears him
I think it was because during Rocio's pregnancy she was listening to all those brothers in the church
he's going to be part of that church, look, what?
he's going to be Brother Pablo, Brother Rodolfo, in a few years
Yes, oh, that would be terrible, oh, look, the last

But no
Look, ¿and haven't you seen, have you heard anything from Marta Bolaños?
¡Oh no!, Marta, look, that trickster took you overalls, yours
¿and how's her pregnancy, did she had her baby already?
Don't even mention her, yeah, she must have had him already
I'm curious, ¿what did she had?
I'm gonna go see her, and just like that I'm gonna ask her for the overalls
Caro, look, and, ¿what happened with... did they promote Félix?
Yeah

Oh, you, Felix hasn't called me, you really... Félix hasn't called me
To manager of i don't know what, ¿huh?, he says he's been really busy, because he got promoted to manager of i don't know what there
¡Oh!, ¿really?
Pro-data manager, and he says, well, i called Caro, and they told me he was studying, but they put that between question marks
¿Really?
¿how could he/she have stayed like that, open?, i don't buy that
But Male, but, he doesn't call, i mean, he hasn't called me at all, he hasn't called
Because he says he's been, he's been in the management, i mean, go figure, he's been really busy, that's why, since they promoted him, right
¿really?
whenever you can
Look, Hugo's coming, I'll call him, i'll call Félix one of these days
Whenever you can, give Felix an "uh huh"

¡Oh!, that's like really expensive, ¿right?, and how
Male, ¿what else do you want us to send to you with Hugo?
And only, only the flag
Only the flag, you don't want anything else?
No
Take advantage of this, since I'm pulling the house apart, don't waste it
Cheese, cheese if you can
Cheese, okay ]
But it also makes me feel bad with Hugo, because Hugo goes to Pennsylvania first
To Pennsylvania?  then no, no we can't
He's in Pennsylvania, so, I don't know how he'll go bringing the things up and down
And Jorgito, ask him if he wants something special for, for
Jorge, do you want them to send you something?  Ah, the camera

And look, And how did it go in Guate?
Fine, fine, kid, kid look, there we were up and down everywhere
And what? Nothing new
No nothing, no I mean normal right?
Mm
A guy from my life I met
Really?
A nephew, a cousin of Evelyn.
Okay
There's one that's very little, and there's one that follows
I'll send you a letter with all the sizes inside and everything
Ok, ok, because they told me here that i could get them in Valencia
Oh
I'll get there, if not, i would have to wait to December
¡Damn, all the way to Valencia!
and the, you know we could, we freed the apartment at El Cafetal
¿And what apartment is that?
The one my dad had, a long time ago, where some Portuguese lived, ¿do you remember?
Oh, that's true, that's true, ¡that's good!
Finally, last week, courts and all, we did an eviction with a moving truck and we got those people out
Look at that, an El Cafetal is a good area, ¿right?
Yes, a four bedrooms apartment
Mamma mia, that's good
So you know, you'll get there with me in December
Oh, you'll be in there
Yes
Oh, excellent, look, and, and, that apartment at Santa Mónica, ¿what's up with that?
That small one, oh, well, that'll be empty. You can also stay here, but for us to be together
Ah, no, sure, I stay with you, no, and the old lady is not going to demand, ah, no, sure, I stay with you.
No, she told me, even mom also can stay, because there are going to be more beds.
Ah, right, because that house, the Chavarono's house is a piece of crap.
Yes, it's very deteriorated.
No, right.
Yes, and when you go to
But I would like to go over there, also to take Benjamin. Well, let me tell you the story
Aha.
Then he saw that of Nostradamus, right? the Kid, right?
Benjamin, ah.
and he couldn't sleep, the day, he couldn't sleep at night, then Carmen, sure, talked with him and I don't know what  - Hold on that they are calling me here, that the villa
Okay, then the Kid couldn't sleep at night, okay, very good, Carmen was talking with him and telling him, no, that's a lie, that's a lie, is okay, then he couldn't sleep
until three in the morning that he went to sleep, okay, then the next day, he kept talking about the same thing, then Carmen, no man, that's a lie, that if the guy no, many, may of the things he sees, haven't happened, and well
Prophecies.
exactly, but Benjamin convinced that the world was going to end, no, because everything he saw convinced him, right? and that the world was going to end and then with that he started shaking, shaking
Ah.
then Gaby told him to go to the kitchen
To do the dishes.
and in that, exactly, no, to go clean the kitchen because, he has to do the kitchen every day, then, at that moment
Imagine, poor kid. Then at that moment, Carmen tells me, that his eyes rolled backward
Aha.
and that he has fallen on the floor, and had an epileptic attack, that he started to shake there, like some convulsions
Bloody Hell!
That, that they had to call the - but that before he had that attack, right? the kid was saying, damn it, what do I want to be alive for if the world is going to end, in other words, it was like a nervous breakdown
Aha, aha,
right? but I think that also has to do with genetics because my mom is more nervous than hell, and Carmen's mom is even worse still.
And remember that Yovani was also epileptic.
No, but Yovani, no, but, but,this time, it wasn't a, it wasn't a thing like that, somatized, well, then
the doctor, right? the doctor examined him?
well, I think so, he went to a doctor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, well, I spoke with my friend here, who has a masters in child psychology
Aha.
like you, right? then he told me that I, that I, that I should confront Benjamin and tell him that I also saw the, which by the way I saw, and it was very convincing, I swear
Yes.
I also got rattled too, no, not true. Look, then - Pardon?
What prophecies did he say?
Well, that the world was going to end
In what year is it going to end?
I don't know, in one thousand nine hundred
That's the one that says about the three days and three nights.
I don't know.
That we are going to be without light, is that one?
Nostradamus, I don't know girl, the thing is that I spoke with an, with an expert, then
So that
I knew the thing, then I confronted Benjamin and told him the thing, ah, and the expert asked me if there had been any change in his life, and the change is that he has moved, see?
Ah, exactly.
then that too, is what has influenced him, some major change in his life, that is what has influenced him, what else. Then I spoke with
for an appointment?
Well, I spoke with Benjam- I spoke with Benjamin and I confronted him, I told him that I also saw the and that -- and that it was very convincing, but, damn it, that I know the world is not going to end, right?
Mm.
and then I put other ideas in his head of another guy called Velikoski that made other predictions of the planet Venus, and of other have, something like that, more, more scientific.
Exactly.
not so much like that of fate.
Aha.
But he seems to be better. Well, I haven't talked to him in a few days.
But you don't know if Carmen took him to get checked, and that.
Well, from what she told me, yes, but she's bad, too. Carmen called me crying
Because if it's a convul-
Carmen called me crying
And really
Pardon? Tell me.
Look, if it's really a convulsion, in will show up on an encephalogram.
Ah, so let me call them and ask them.  Okay.
It's that
Perfect.
So if it's a convulsion, you have to see if it's a part of the brain and you have to medicate it --
No, forget it, no.  Good.
that in general, when, when, when they convulse --
Well, she told me that she was in the apartment, and I don't know if she shook, I don't know, I don't know.
and it wouldn't be a defense mechanism, so they wouldn't send her to clean the kitchen?
Exactly, it's a combination of everything, I think.  Every time I call her, she's cooking, Chama, it's the only thing I know.
Well, but, but what abuse is this, that she doesn't have a kid.
Well, she tells me that it's to teach responsibilities, but it's more the dick, damn, I don't know what she's doing with this fool.
In any case, she called me cry-, that I come visit her, I have to go visit her, I don't know how.  Ah, I already paid, who --
Do you know who called me right now.  Geraldine's mom called me.
Ah, what did she want?
That Geraldine lost your address and telephone number and she called me so I would give them to her.
Ah, I've also thought about Geraldine, well I'll see her in
She's traveling, she's going to Europe, to Monaco --
Geraldine --

Great, she went to Monaco.

She's by Monaco, and then it seems she wanted to write to you or send a postcard and she had lost the address and she called Marta, and Marta called me a moment ago
What a trip. Well, tell her that I bought a box of condoms, that I see her in December.
Ah, I told Marta that you were coming.
And?
Ah, we have to do a meeting.
Girl, are you eating meat, already?
No.
Me neither. Look, then I already have the tickets and everything.
You already have everything ready. You arrive the twenty first.
I arrive the twenty first, but I arrive very late so don't come to pick me up, let the old man come alone, I arrive at eleven at night.
Eleven at night?
The twenty first, yes.
What day is the twenty first, what day is it?
Damn, wait, I don't know. Look, I have, we have five more minutes. Then I arrive the twenty first and I stay until the eleventh, three weeks, Girl, so I'm going to be broke when I return back here

Look, I was able to get one of the cheapest tickets, five hundred dollars for me and four hundred and fifty for Benjamin.
Fuck, is that cheap?
Fuck, I don't know, it was around a thousand dollars for both of us.
Fuck, how did you get that much.
It's cheap, right. Oh?
And, what, do you have layovers?
Well, I'm going to Mi- well I still have to buy mine, the one, I bought it to Minneapolis and I still have to buy mine from here to Minneapolis, it's like three hundred dollars more
Oh, okay
So, because I wanted to travel from  Minneapolis with him, right?

Yovani will get here at the end of August.
Yovani is coming in two weeks.
Oh, you have to call me when he's there.
Oh, no, sure I will, I'll try to get one of these numbers again
These, where did  you get these one?
Well, here in the, in the, in the Chama, you have to call the Central University of Venezuela and ask for a modem --
I will bring you a modem in December, but if you can they give you an account that enables you to talk by the computer every day, chatting --
Electronic mail --
By e-mail but not only that, Chama, but if I give you my address here, you can get into my computer here, and we can write each other at the same time, you know what I mean? the screen --
But my computer is very old, will it work out?
What computer is it?
A shit

No, the modem is the connection, no, you have to call the computer department and tell them that, damn, that you have a brother here in the United States that's going to send some scientific programs on the computer and that you need to have electronic mail
Aha
and to see, that they give you an account, what you want is an account, that you need to have an account to have your email.
And I can't tell this friend of mine that already has it, to communicate with this crazy girl, that, that
Is that she needs to have a modem
And she has it.
Look, your friend ah?

Well, and with that modem she has to call the Central University of Venezuela and have an account in the Central University of Venezuela or in some university, in Simon Bolivar I have some friends that are in the university

Yes, I have it in my house, but I have an account in the university, in this university, see.

and she's going to go with a friend of Felipe but not anymore
and besides that, they asked him to vacate the apartment, no? I already knew that
Yes he arrived with a friend and Felipe did not go, Rosa Maria will have a surgery, I think she already had it
When, there in Mazatlan was she going to have a surgery?
Oh yes, she has a ball in her breast right?

Why?
remember that they only give you at most fifteen minutes

But Eddie, since he'll marry Miriam, and you came, and Cheli will be alone.  But, that's how it has to be.  And how when she comes back there, she will get married.
He'll get married for her whole life.
Yes.
So, he tells me that, in another life, he will stay with the same wife.
Yes.
And I said, hey, and if your wife has defects.  It doesn't matter, he told me, everyone has defects.  And he was more than, and I said, well, but, do you have a girlfriend?  No, he told me.
He has to, he will have to look then.  But.
Yes, hey.  I find him really charming, I love it, when he comes.
Yes.
I really find him, I said, hey.
Aye, how great.
And when he prays, hey, well it's really impressive, when we went there to the
Yes, ah, yes.
the service, I don't know what this is called, hey, and, but
Yes, he's really sincere, in everything, really sincere, ah.
Yes, and when we were taking the bread and the water, and the anointment, it was a really beautiful thing, hey.
Yes, yes, that's how it is, ah
He's, he's really charming, I'm in love with your son.
It's like this, people in the church are like this, hey, this is the
Hmm.  I'm in love with your son.
How nice. How nice they want it. Really?
And to the lady. To the lady where they live, they call her mommy and I, the other day, when they called mommy, I thought, why don't they call me mommy, instead.
Really?
But, I did not say anything.
So, you should have told them, well.
It's very I said. And when we talk on the phone, suddenly he treats me informally,and tells me, wait
.
But afterwards, he comes over, and sees our wrinkles and then, treats us in a formal manner.. It's very I said!
It's that I said, it's just, you know, here the people who speak Spanish here treat everyone informally. ah?
Mm
they don't teach them here in the schools, or I don't know, to differentiate that. ah?
Ah.
Then, they, treat everyone informally, and the I, I have told them many times that, Miriam, also has the habit of treating her elders informally, ah?
Mm
And then, so you see, I have told them, you should not do tha-no, that is not the way to speak to your elders. Then, probably, I told him, many times.
Before he left, I said, be very careful when you speak to the people there, I said.
Mm
To the kids your age, you can treat informally, I said, but to people who are your elders you can not speak like this, because it is disrespectful, mm, so I told him this
And the, and he took it seriously.
Ah, I told him many
He took it seriously.
Of course, I told him many times, I.
Hmm
Because imagine that, that he talks to any older person
Of course.
so, that do not know him, It is a lack of respect!
Of course,
Then, them the, the, imagine, how, maybe he could be told.Then, that, that, he had to put that in his head, do you see it, the
Of course.
by force, then, surely he had made the mistake many times, anyway, you see, because he was used to talk like that here, eh.
Listen, and he knows so many ways of talking like this, of young people, young. The other day he told me, I told him, listen, and when you speak to people on the street, how do you do it, and told how he does it, and well, he does it well.
And, wait a second, Graciela, I am going to tell Orlando that uses the other telephone, that ways he listens, because he also wants to know, the.
Yeah.
Orlando. take the other telephone, well, I had forget that So he, like this, because he also wants to know of Eddie, well.
Of course, well, it is logical.
Of course, and he wants to know too, and then -
Is he on the phone?
Yeah, yes, yes, continue, Graciela.
Listen, then, see, I told him that how he did it, he told me that at first he felt a little bit shy, but not anymore, and each time he talks more fluent, ah.
Ah.
so then, It has more words and everything.
of course.
I get closed to people and greet then ask them questions to meet each other.
so sometimes they tell me to go with them and that is when we start drinking and get drunk
I used to hear the little kids to hit the pear, but I had no idea what that was.
what
so then, I told you to hit the pear means that you get to a house and eat a lot of food until you get drunk.
and when we said good bye we ate a lot so they had to say good bye...
so the two of them got sick
how would that be just imagine
so, they ate a lot and got drunk again because there was a baptized.
so the two of them got sick again.
so you see that´s what happens when you eat too much
there were tortas, It is very nice to see you.
yes he eats everything, so he is very good
Yes
He ate big plates every day, I used to spend time in the kitchen every day.
I am not sure because I never knew the address to let you know
okay
but, it was Recoleta.
Recoleta
Recoleta
because it said it was close to the Zoo, and what do I know, but I didn't know neither the name of the street, nor the
Yes.
nor the number either. And for what he said, they gave him very good food.
Ah.
They gave him very good food, and plenty of it.
Yeah, that's good.
So that, and-
Eddie says that he has lost weight, because he lost, he lost two sizes.
That he has lost two sizes in clothing, he says.
Sure, it's that you know what happens, that he walks a lot.
He has to walk so much, you know.
What?
Ah?
He walks a lot.
He walks a lot, yes, that.
Sure, he has to walk all day long, look, so I, in a certain way, think that must be good for him.
Yeah. Sure.
Of course it's too much, ah.
Yes
But, i think that must be good for him, walking and all, because he said he didn't do any sports or anything there
Sure
¿Huh?
Yeah, he was really lazy. Really lazy for sports
And besides, besides, he was really fatty, and now
Sure
He's always fatty, but no, never that much, oh, and that's another thing he uses, never that much. I told him ¿do you think I'm too old, Eddie?
"Never that much" he said. Kids now, instead of saying "not that much", they say "never that much", and he knows all that stuff
Never that much, ¡oh, that Eddie's so funny!, all that stuff
He knows all that stuff, he talks with you, he talks with you just like boys
Imagine later when he gets there, how we're all gonna laugh listening to him, ¡oh!
Yeah, he's very
If when he went to Mexico a few years back, he returned talking like mexicans, oh, well, oh, yeah, we laughed so hard, it was so funny
¿He?
Yeah
Hey, tell me about Glenn now, ¿how's Glenn?
es, look, Glenn is young, he's the same age Miriam is, he's
Uh huh
How can i say, he's very reserved... Estela, ¡Estela!, Graciela
Mm
We were recently talking with Estela, that's why I told you Estela.
Ah.
Eh, Graciela, how do I tell you, he's very quiet, ah?
Ah.
You, ah, he has come a lot here, but is not a person that inspires trust, let's say, ah? with whom you immediately feel comfortable, you understand me?
Mm
It takes a lot for him to become comfortable. Ah? But is
Mm But he seems to be a very good person because Eddie thinks very highly of him.
Yes, he's very pleasant, yes, but is
He always talks like that, very highly of him.
Yes
He says he's tall and skinny.
Yes, it's true, he's tall and skinny.
How Glenn is, I tell him, tall and skinny.
yes, it's true
And he told me, that Miriam is short.
yes.
Translate, then, ah and you remember what I told you in a letter.
yes
I told him, you say short, then he told me, she's short and he started to lower his hand until it stayed like that by the size of a doll
the other day he started singing the American national anthem
Ah.
then, I told him, they all put their hand on their chest, on the heart when they sing? yes, he told me, as a sign of respect. Then, I told him, and the women too? Also the women and the babies.
The babies!
Listen, and he laughs with desire, later, listen.
Yes, yes.
And he's been, he's been having a lot of confidence.
Yes, how nice.
Luckily, that we see that he's loosening up now, here.
okay.
At first he would come, like he was, what do I tell you when we met him the first day in the church
Yes.
that like that, I found him so serious, he didn't smile or anything, however now he laughs with such desire.
Sure, sure.
And suddenly, when the mate that is American, talks fast in English, but I do not understand him a single word. Nothing, but I do not understand anything.
Oh!
suddenly, the other day he sung a song, and suddenly said and after that said and I told him, is that a religious song, right?, How did you knew it? he told me.
I told him because it said, but I did not understand anymore.It is that he talks so fast, listen.
Yes, yes, yes.
But it is very I said, and he is talking very fast in Spanish, and well, see it.
How good, see it, how good. It is that
Hmm. No, he is very charming.
Is that you have to think, that after all he looks big, and all, but deep inside he is a child, ah?
Of course, yes he is very childish.
And having gone there so far, and, and for so long, ah.
And that, that is what I said that all things, look, that for example, the other day I told him how do your room looks like, Eddie, then he told me, it is, it is, has a bunk bed, and there is not more space,
it is small, but it does not matters, does not matter, we are fine. And everything, like that, it does not matter, doesn´t matter. And he says that here in Chile, What a cold!, he says, this is not cold!, there is not cold here!
I tell him, but Eddie, you have to wear the, the, see that the inside part of his coat seems that he left it in the first room,
And, did he lose it?
you have to tell him that ah?
Did he lose it?
He lest it in his first room, it seems like and seems like he does not take it seriously. He has to go for it.
Ah!
well listen, and, then he eh, I told him, but Eddie you have to wear it, one day that was raining. It is not cold, he told me, of course, well listen, if you compare it with the cold in the United States, well listen.
but i have other immediate plans
Yeah, that's why, like i told you, you never know, ¿right?
Yeah, yeah i thought, because, you see, I'm just an analyst, and i was thinking of doing a...
Yeah, uh huh
in Statistics
Sure

Applied, of course
Uh, I'm working somewhere else, now, i have a lot of work
Oh, ¿what, what, where are you working?
I'm working with a transplant group
Oh
and also at the Academy, which is my regular job, let's say
Yeah, and at the Academy, in the end, uh, ¿are your relations ok?, so that you can use it or do you keep like that
No, because that, you see, that's a story, ¿you know?, because in Papilotas
Right
with those
Right
things, and they only want to use them for research, let's say, uh
yes
And for the things that I want to talk to you, it's useles,  because I want to
Exactly.

Not so much as she expected, because see, because see, the first surgery was very good.
Aha.
before see it, with the prospects of the first eye with surgery, and the second, see, she sees better than before, but nor perfect.
It looks a little bit different, of course, with the other one.
Of course, because she expected, well, that it was going to be than the other one, it seems the first eye was the exception, I don´t know it was a mess, is like she recovered a hundred percent of a normal person.
And the other one, was normal, lets say.
The other one was what should be expected in a surgery like this kind.
Ah, see, poor thing, yes.
An improvement, but a relative one, not a very high percentage. Uh, and well, my old lady lives stubborn on my grandma's subject and all that, but well
Yeah, i can imagine

Aha. And what, what plans do you have, let's say.
We spent, we spent about two thousand, in that.
Oh my God. What, and where do you have it, in her house.
Sure she has the house of her grandfather, that died, it was left empty, and we have it there.
Oh, that's good, and that house is like a candidate.
As a deposit, no, no, we want to see about getting a loan, really.
No but Ah, ah, ah.
Because that house is next door to the parents.
Ah.
And I don't like the idea too much.
Yes, that's not cool.
That, that it's very far, and second, you see, now
the, the daughter in law, next door to the mother in law
Right, I don't like that.
Yes, yes, yes I understand you.
Yes well, the idea is to put together, eh, see, to be able to get a credit, or something like that,
yes, that is.
that you need to put together forty percent of the value of the property. And it
Forty percent, and what, with what you earn, how much do you earn, how is the issue of the salaries, yes.
I'm fine. I'm fine because I have several jobs, so to speak.You see, now I have two jobs, on top of that the jobs I do on the side, but I can't count on those every month.
Sure, but like that more or less, something standard, I mean, what you do in the Academy, how much do they give you.
And there, one thousand pesos, let's say, and five hundred pesos more, from the other job.
Mm.
and average let's put I do some cuatrilao?. Average, which is the average job for three hundred pesetas more, apart.
Listen, you're killing yourself, or do you have any free time, ah
No, no. Yes, yes, yes. Generally, like four in the afternoon I'm free of everything.
Sure, sure. Ah, good, good, good.
Okay, some day a little more, see, another day three thirty, it depends, I'm calm, so to speak. I'm like that, then crazy, crazy.
Sure and you're saving like crazy, I imagine. More or less.
And sure, I'm paying the car payment.
Ah, that's good.
And I'm saving.
And living, living life like an adult
I bought an amazing sound system, with one thing, with three
Ah, the flute, ah.
eh, yes, of those critters that have one thing on top of the other
Yes, wow, what a look, that's good.
Yes, great, great. I'm super busy,
Yes, and, when I go in December, will you be going around?
In December I will still be here, I'm not going to
In the holidays, ah, OK. Yes, because I tell you that it will be, it will be more or less messed up in the sense that I will be there little time, and, and
And on top of that it's the holidays.
And it's the holidays, and
I mean, even, how long will you stay more or less, a month?
Look, I will arrive on Saturday, I think it's Saturday the sixteenth of December.
Yes.

January the second, yes. And in the middle, see, my family, we will go to the beach for a few days.
You will stay little and nothing.
Eh, sure, that's why, like that, eh, that we'll have to arrange
Yes, try to arrange, at least a couple of times, to see each other.
No, that's for sure, but what I want to say is, well, we will have to talk, eh
Yes, I am
Yes, and then, well, the rest fine yeah.
This is tanguiz, this is
It's fine.  No news from the country, today?  There's nothing, no?
And no, there was the kilombo, this attack.
Here, yes, well, the bomb, they told me, I read that there was a kind of false alarm.
Ah, yes, yes.
that made everyone hysterical, and no one wanted to get close to the Jewish things.
Last week.  Yes, not much, and so
Yes, they're pretty much, that it came from a Jewish establishment, eh, crap, no?
Ah, yes, these are they.  The only one where the attack was, let's say, after, besides
Yes.
it's these things, bickering, let's say, eh
Exactly, they just came to me, they sent me a pile of magazines and
Yes.
with things from Mundial and things about the attack, no?  Pretty depressing, to be honest.
Yes, this continued.
It's from here, the one from here
It seems like a mess, this, like one hundred people died there.
Yes, it was one hundred people, yes, yes, besides like I tell you, you're really sensitive here because here, anything that they say in Argentina makes you --
Sure, it pricks you.
The ret- ah, yes.
of course, think about it
More, for example I, see it, I play football I like tango
all this is, is a mess after the attacks,
No. no, objectively,
here next to the world, that is important
Yes, be brave, because you know in the
Listen, a whole building exploded, like this, in a clean way
Yes, yes, no, what I wanted to tell you, is the importance given to that here, because as an example, it was breaking news in the it is an important newspaper, like La Nacion, something like that.
Yes.
And in the local newspaper in Seattle
Hmm, no ball.
well, it didn´t appeared, only four paragraphs the day after the attack.
No but the local newspaper of Seattle it must be like, I don't know, the newspaper of a town of
of Santiago del Estero, see, yes
Of course,
but here we are talking of cities with five million people, yes. That makes you mad.
Yes, I know, but with the mind they have, they see only what they have around them, right?
Exactly.
Because of that I say, every day I don´t wonder it, even when it is big but it is that maybe there are reporters who are going to ask things everybody know, and they don´t know, where is Buenos Aires, and they say in Brazil
Exactly. well, I tell you, those are stories that you find here all the time, ah.
Well, well, so this program comes and last Friday there was a red alert, this is also, well ]

aha
and if I dream it it's because it's true
aha, and what did Sandra say?
go screw yourself she was going to say - she was making it up or, at best this nightmare or this dream is because she saw
yes
but I don't know, i didn't ask, once I asked another woman who you left as truth, she told me no, well
hmm
she only says no.
And you don't know, what he's doing?  Nothing, you don't know anything about him

Tito got like crazy, Tito Naivi and told him all sorts of things, like he was disrespectful to his wife see; like I don't have dignity
mm
well, sure, well after I tell them look Volco, look Pupe, I tell them I don't think, I'm fighting with you, each person has their own way of thinking, I feel very Jewish
and I think that after we started with the time of process right? well, the issue is that there were some words said
yes, yes
and he the day before yesterday Volco came by the business he says, are you guys mad at me? he was I don't know on how many pills, he was drunk, well then, he came to apologize.

that, since it's not enough for both then the only one and because since Sylvia works and earns to be able to support the house and since Ana doesn't work, then the only one that works there is Coco to be able to get a salary, Ana helps him
and then Lito goes to supervise only and to take the papers
And what does Lito do?
Lito, and Lito doesn't get a salary, he handles the accounting and there a Friday, a Saturday he goes to help him

It's wonderful, because Coke it's going to be in his thing, also, that's the important thing that he's in what he does so, sure.
Totally, and also that it's a -- It's an area that he likes more, than what he was doing here.
Sure, much more, of course.
Okay, and besides that, look, it's called the national laboratory and that, it's called that because that little town is where the laboratory is, and it's a little more
okay.
to the north, to the north, to the northeast of Knoxville
Okay,
but it's a very small place, then we are going to live in Knoxville, because it's a city similar to this one,
Ah, okay, I mean, Coke goes to that part.
He would go everyday to work
It's small.
in fact we are going to have to, have to buy another car, we are going to have to do several other things
Ah, Amintita, what a nice thing, what joy!
Sure, but we are really happy, listen!
Listen, and you have to put the kids in another school.
Of course, well the kids, I did everything regarding the school I had done it as if we were going to continue here, perfectly fine, no problem at all
Sure, of course.
then the kids will request a transfer, after, I'll request a transfer of school so that they don't miss so many classes
Okay, oh
and, you know that Knoxville from here is just like seven hours, well, the same from
Sure, Amintita, and you have to sell all your things?
No, no, we are going to do kind of like a move, we are going to
That's better, so you don't have to spend so much.
Yes, no. No, no, no. the only thing we had thought was with Coke, perhaps to lighten a little a little the truck and so everything fits in one truck would be, perhaps, sell the sofas, at least the big ones and buy newer sofas there, one thing
Sure, that's it. Sure.
but the other things, you know, you don't take the fridge or the kitchen so it's easier.
No, no, the things, the more personal things you do take them with you, the electric devices, you do, you take the beds, the sofas, you can move them,
Sure. All those things, all those things. Sure, sure, of course.
Hey Amintita, I'm glad, why don't you talk to your dad for a while?
Yes, oh, yes, put him in the line, exactly
I'm so happy but he also wants to talk to you, before the fifteen minutes end.
That's right mom.
Oh my dear Amintita, I'm so glad to speak to you, so so glad!
I'll send you a letter with more details.
My dear, I love you so, so much. Tell Coke that I'm really, really happy.
Mom, I'm glad, I'm so glad to talk to you, this makes me feel at peace. Hey mom
Yes, we are doing fine, my daughter.
Tell daddy that to talk to him, he also has to say the phrase I told you.
Here he is, here he is. Here he is, goodbye, kisses.
Bye, kisses.
Hey, and what about the kids, are they okay?
They are fine mom, no problems, growing. Goodbye, kisses, bye, bye.
I see, bye, kisses.
Hello?
Hello, daddy.
Hello my beautiful daughter, precious, how are you.
Hello, very well, daddy. before we talk you have to say that you authorize that this conversation is recorded, when I tell you now.
Okay.
Now.
I authorize the recording of this conversation.
Now, I also authorize this conversation is recorded. Listen, so you know the news, ah?
Yes, my daughter, tell me new things, something you have not told your mother, because she later tells me, ah?
Okay.Well, I tell you that the children begin school on Monday, tomorrow, on Sunday, eh, a day after tomorrow --
But in Raleigh?
Now in Raleigh, of course --
Yeah.
and are going to be here, more or least, around a month --
Yeah.
and the only one that is not going to go to school is Karina --
Yeah.
because as, she was at school, registered and all, but to her that is so young, it is going to be such a mess to take her here and later take her to another place, she is going to get confused, and it is possible she ends not wanting to go anywhere.
Of course.
So I am going to let her until September when we arrive there.
Yeah.
But the two little kids already went to school to one that they call, to get to know their room, their teachers, and Machito was super happy in school, what do I tell you, super. He will go to --
Ah, that's good. In the same school that Christian attended before --
The same one of Christian and he will be there until three in the afternoon every day, from eight thirty to a quarter to --
Yeah.
and Christian --
And, when do you have to be in Knoxville?
Eh, Coke has to be working on the first day of October.
Ah, and you when, do you think you'd go with him?
Yes, no, no, we're all going together, I think that from the middle of September onwards, because we have to look for an apartment --
Yeah.
and we will try to do on single trip, I mean, to go and rent there, because at least there is a Chilean couple that knows, that Coke knows, but that they
Ah, yeah.
help us too, and he knows another Brazilian over there, so a --
And --
those people will help us, I think, they will --
You will be closer to Patricio, too, well.
Much closer to him, well listen, and, and also that
Sure, he will be half way there, almost --
Sure, and you know, we it's so nice, well dad, because he is, is at the foot of the mountains, twenty minutes away from the ski centers, of all the things --
Ah. Ah, how nice.
So, of course, I think, we're actually content, that is this part here, Raleigh, fascinates me, but, but we'll be better there. Of course.
Yeah.  Good. Listen, Amintita, and the delivery of the department, they don't have to pay a fine or anything like that.
Right, that we'll see, uh, I think it's likely that yeah, but to go there
Ah
knowing that if you present a document like a job transfer, because the source of payment is the same as Coke, let's see, uh, it seems like that issue is eliminated.
So Brazil is going to continue paying? Yeah.
Right. Basically, let's say, and like that, that like it could be eliminated maybe, but I don't know, but in any case, I think that we're not going to worry about that because the most important thing is that we're better there, after well
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That, look, it's like, geez, we'll be happy.
Geez, how nice, Amintita, we're super happy about this news.
Aha. Listen, papi, I'll tell you some more news, we bought a big TV.
I can't believe you, wow!
A stereo TV, big, with cable, big letters come out at the bottom, in Spanish, to narrate for you.
Oh, wow, how many inches?
Twenty-five.
Twenty-five! You've outdone yourself now! We have a twenty-one inch one that we still think is enormous.
It's twenty-five inches, but it's
Shoot, what tremendous TV!
But it's that you know that it looks pretty on the table and still a TV big for once and for all, because we've never had a TV like that.
Yeah. Of course, well, listen --
Never, so it stayed for the, for the videos and for the other batch.
That's yummy! Well we are glad, for the machine, that's yummy Amintita! Hey, what about the car?
Hey daddy, tell me about the, no the car, we fixed it, it's okay now, but
I see, I mean, you are going to use it.
Yes, no, we are using it because we can't change the car here, that's the problem, we are going to need two cars.
Oh.
because Coke has to use one car for his work and I'll have to use the other one, so, we'll have to figure out a way of doing this, I think we rather buy another car there.
because we can't buy one here, as when we leave, Coke would have to drive the truck with our things and I'm going to drive the car
Oh, I see, I see, I see. I see.
you see? so, we can't have two cars here, not yet, so
Oh, I see.
But I think that when we get settled we will try to change this one for another car.
I see.
but we have done so many repairs to this car that  we already know it, that's what's happening
Yes, well, I see-
we have put money into it, oh, also, yes. Tell me, how are you?
Sure, well, Puchas, I'm happy, Nintita and the kids, how are they, are they excited with the move?
Oh Christian is really happy. He doesn't want to know more because
Oh, Christian is delighted!
Sure, he knows that he'll now have his own room, so it's going to be better for him, you know? So, he's thrilled!
one piece just for him.
Sure.  Hey, tell me a little, a little bit about you.
Look, girl, eh, I'm -
In health, how have you been?
We've been well, fortunately, in health -
Yeah.
I'm still a little fat, in any case -
Yeah.
Eh, no, I've been able to lower the kilos so I'm, eh, a little below -
Yeah.
but I should leave bread completely, you know?
Ah, yeah.
and it's hard, because at eleven is when I want to eat bread, since during the day I try not to eat it.
Sure.
But, in any case, I've been well.
Sure.
Eh, the other thing is I'm taking classes in the other school -
Yes.
in the Arancel industry, let's say, in what's left in Valparaiso -
Valparaiso, yeah, Ah-
there in the Italy park, there I'm going to take classes during all this semester.
Look, how nice.
And the possibility of going to Mendoza is pending, I mean
okay
I'm still designated on that, but in Argentina they had, it seems, some problems to organize the course better
Okay
and they don't have, it seems, the amount of people that they wanted
Okay
so I'm waiting and it can unleash at any moment, but not in September anymore
Yeah, yeah, yeah
possibly, I have to go in October or november, but it's just a long weekend
Ah, no, I see, I see, what
I mean thursday, Friday and Saturday - something really intensive, but with everything paid, I mean, all expenses paid, plane, hotel
Sure. Ah, great
and a hundred do- hundred dollars a day
Wow, nice, daddy
A hundred dollars a day for three days, that's three hundred dollars. Those are the conditions that - a coworker, but let's say, right now the matter is
the matter is pending because they've had some difficulties
Sure
So those are, those practically are the news, the briefest news, because the other thing, about Carli, I can tell you that
I see
ah, Jessica is two months pregnant
Yes, how has she been feeling, how has she
13 weeks, and the other day they did a test and they listened to the baby's little heart
wow! ay-
today, well we just went to see Jessica, because Carli had to play today in Santiago, in Alto de las Condes
I see
so we went there to say hi, a little while, to Jessica and we met with her parents there
They were at home, too
And who introduced her, Hugo?
Hugo, Hugo himself, and Hugo almost flew away because he was saying, make her scream, so we, the three of us started running and well
I see.
Make her run, whatever, and the dog was taking, oh?
And how did you go there, how did you?
Oh, Hugo picked her up and we went there by bus, well.
Oh, I see, And
And Hugo brought her to me.
I see, and the crook, Raul was saying that it was fine?
I was, sure, well, the Judge thought it was beautiful, the only problem was the little tail.
But, but it's weird, this this crook, Raul supposedly sold the dog to me and it's a well bred dog
Well but sometimes, the other litters are, well.
Maybe but he sold me, he had two dogs and I always had the doubt about if he sold me the, the, he charged me a lot of money, but
I see. No, but
and I always had a doubt that maybe he gave me the dog that, he told me that he was going to send me one but maybe he gave me the other one.
Well, it doesn't matter, it's perfect, well.
No, I guess this one, he has to be happy, yes, well, two dogs, the first and then the third place
Sure.
And no
And the dog, when she stood in front of the Judge
Hmm.
with the paw and all, it looked like a statue, quiet and staring, and the ears pointing up, everything -- it looked beautiful.
and the --
We didn´t have a camera to take a picture, but no --
And the other one, the "cabro" was not there, Alex?
No, Alex wasn´t there.
Yeah.
So what we have the cup!
how good, oh.
Imagine it.
So that,so Hugo have a good eye, it seems. when he said to present her --
Of course, well, and all the ones presented had a bad place --
Yeah.
and I when I saw the others dogs, I thought that ours was going to be the last one, and don´t, she was going forward, and finished like the third one.
in the category of eight, of --
Of category, ah
Six to twelve, to twelve months.
Of course, half dogs, yeah, well.
And of course. And how old is Aida, Isn´t she ten months old?
She is eleven, she is going to be eleven.
I see, did you solve the problems with the papers?
Yes, well, she's enrolled now, under your name, she's in the year and you are the owner.
Oh, that's great, I see. Fine, well I haven't paid the fees in the Chilcoa-
Well, you, are you calling later or until tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Hey, hey, call me tomorrow, didn't you do the technical revision?
No, we have fifteen minutes and we've just spoken for four.
Oh I see.
The technical revision to the van?
Yes, the paper said that it lasted until May.
of?
now, well, don't you have to do it every year?
No, I think I did it.
No, it doesn't have the stickers or the papers, nothing.
And what happens if I didn't do it?
We have to do it because if we are going to go to the airport if we are stopped they'll take money from us
Sure, but I thought that, that Carlos was probably going to take you
Yes, well, that's what we want to do
because-
because, Carlos isn't committing to it now, he's just, we haven't used it, we only used it when we had to go to the hospital with Francina and then we realized, a short time ago
I didn't remember, sure, it seems that --
Yes, well, and how did it go for you?
Fine, but my head hurts but more, I'm fed up, I don't know why --
Why.  You sleep badly, as they say.
No, I don't know.  No --
Did you get the faxes?
Yes, yesterday I got Francisca's one, yesterday, yester-
You got the one from Francisca?
It was yesterday, sure.  Yes.
And Claudia's one on the computer?
Also, also.
Ah, yeah, she says that it was up until the name of the boy.
Yes, I got that one too.  Hey, and so now I went, I went out in the morning, I went to the laboratory, after I went to have lunch, and then I went to see a movie.
Ah, that's great.  So you've become really up to date on movies.
I've seen two movies, that's it.
Ah, what did you see, the little ones say.
I saw a movie that just opened today, one day it's called.
Yeah, and is it less how now, Pato?
A bit less, but it's still really hot.  It's strange here, there are storms, it's hot, eh --
Yeah.
Today the weather was a bit better, but --
Yea, all the same. But, your things, have they gone well?
Ah, yes, yes I'm now --
Ah, that's good.
I'm almost ready to return, I'm coming -- in truth I could have taken advantage of a couple more months if I could, because all the same I have many things to do, but --
Yeah, and, wouldn't it have been convenient for you to stay?
No, it's that I don't, I can't.
Ah, because of classes --
Sure, and because of the scholarship, for three months, no more and all like that, I would, I mean, to do things, I could stay, because there are many things to do and here the only thing I have to do are experiments, I mean, over there in the laboratory it's not, it's different.
Yeah.
Here I'm all day dedicated to doing things in the laboratory, so it's much more productive --
Yeah.
But, but, no, I'm ready to go, just, not any more, I don't want to think any more --
Ah?
I don't want to think any more of staying here, yeah.
No?
No.
Well I don't know --
Well, my head is hurting, it doesn't go away.
But how much, I find that the other, the thing about the appointment, you should stay calm no more, well, that's what has you more neuro --
No ]
No?
No, yes, I don't know why, but they give me migraines, I --
But it's nerves, well --
No, no, I don't know if it's nerves, tension, or whatever, I don't know, but here they've given me migraines, several, and I've had like five in three months, strong ones, they make me want to vomit --
That, ah, how tough.  It's not the food?
Hmm, I don't think so --
The stomach, how is it, good?
Fine, no, my stomach doesn't hurt at all, yes it's as if nothing, I don't find any justification for it.
Yeah.
Today for example, I slept well last night and everything but suddenly, in the morning, it started with a little pain that was bothersome --
Yeah.
after in the theater it started to hurt more, I went to see another movie --
And you left.
but yeah, yeah, I couldn't, because it hurt a lot, and I came here to take some pills.  Hey, but you, are you well?
Chuta, be careful with the pills.  Everyone's good, hmm.
Yeah.
We're going, that's it, exhausted, as I tell you.
Yeah.  Yes well, you have to work hard there -
You, huh?
you have to run a lot here.
That was what we did the three of us, well.
Ah.
The other ones with a trumpet, with the eh, and us with just the name, and the bitch, but, fast.
And Letelier, didn't you see him?
No. Do you remember the little old man, that one, what's his name?
with white hair?
Mmm.
Oh which little old man, the treasurer, or which little old man, well --
No, no, no, the one that had a dog, he went with his little dog --
Munizaga?
the dot that ah?
Munizaga? Yes.
Munizaga, presented a son of his bitch --
Ah, yeah, a puppy --
and we counted there all the cheeks, third place, and we stayed all the time with the Cup there, so that everyone saw us, ah
And he, and how did he do.
Bad, just there, well.
Yes, because his bitch was not very good.
We, I'm telling you, and we were laughing at you, well, plus what you shouted and ran, we, right there simple, third place.
Ah, with the, with Agata once we came in third
Also?
It seems, it seems.
But the third get a Cup, so
Yes, then, no yes then we came in fifth it seems, we came in fifth
It has to have been fourth, sure.
It was the best it came in.
Sure. Imagine, I tell you that the Cup is very nice, it says, Third Place
Okay, I'm going to talk a little with the girls, for what I don't know. Tomorrow I'm going to call, anyway
Okay, yes, I'm going to put them on. Okay then, we are, you are calling in the evening?
Okay, ah, yes, in the evening, yes, a kiss, bye, hope you're well.
Okay, see you, likewise, take care, okay, bye. okay Pepa
Hello?
Hello
Hello, how are you?
Fine. How have you been.
Good, super good, in all the branches. Did you get my?
Yes, yes I received it, so
It's just I had to send it with the, with the issue of Cristian because they erased all our letters already.
Yes, and why did they erase them.
Because, well, the network was dropping, all that thing I had told you, so.
Ah.
and they did a reorganization of everything, and they saw the ones that had computing fields and the ones that didn't, they took out, simply like that.
I mean
We don't have rights us
Only a few students, have rights?
Sure, the ones that have computing, only.
Uh.
So there we are
In other words, that you don't have an account, then
No. Yes, mom, yes I'm just now talking, yes Eh, no well, he said that maybe he would see if he could get me an account, but legally, I shouldn't have.
Okay, He, he works there, he's not a student, isn't it true?
No, he studies also. Studies and works right there. I mean
Ah, okay.
He studies in the University and works in Cecom
Okay, because
So since he knows
Yes, since, it's supposed that the students should have access to the
to the ones they are giving to are to the ones who memorize things
Okay.
They were giving them access to the red-
Yeah.  I sent you a message too, I don't know if the, well sure, also-
in, in mine or in his?
No, to your account, but- no, to Cristian's, I don't remember.
Ah.  Ah, I'll go and see them, I'll go and ask if something came from you, so, let's see -
Hey, eh, and he, Carlos at least can take the little truck to get a technical review-
Hmm, I will tell him, I think so, I think that-
I don't have, that I don't have an extinguisher, or if there is, it's behind the seat-
I see, but him, I see, in every case, he must have, because the car he got.
Sure, he asked for it, I believed that my aunt would borrow it to him, the extinguisher and the first aid kit because
Everything.
Sure, it seems to me that I don't have an extinguisher.
I see. Mmm.
You would have to borrow one from, him or my aunt's.
I see. Oh yes we can get one, I'm telling you.
I see, I see.
I see, well, here's the Pelusita.
Oh, kisses, hope you are fine.
I see, kisses. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hello?
Hello, my love.
Hello, daddy.
How are you?
Fine and you?
Fine, I got your fax yesterday.
You did?
Yes, where you were asking me to buy the gymnastic Barbie.
We had there a lavish party. You know, and it was great, and I've had a lot presents, and now -- starts life as a worker, well --
my boss gave me a tablecloths pack -- my, my thesis professor gave me a ceramic plate, to serve cheese, hours d'oeuvres and so --
and a picture frame, and a coffee cup and some little things like this. So, well, imagine, great.
Right now has arrives Gati -- because since she lives like we do, she goes to sleep when we do, so she is here sleeping, that we don't --
Remember this is being recorded, don't you --
says - I don't care, Maria says that unfortunately she can't be like a cat. just imagine, she would get here like a ball, like a bubble--
The flower basket I have here has just fallen down
Oh, I'm so tired, well
Oh
Listen, there's one thing I've wanted to ask a couple of times and I always forget about it, did you get the postcards I sent you? -- of Marilyn Monroe and a pussy cat, oh, look
Yes, yes, of course I did
What does Maria say?
Oh, in the postcard you have sent t oMaria --
Yes
that comes the, I am dressed in blue because I am ugly, I am dressed in beige because --
Oh, yes
and the maroon one, that word we haven't found in the dictionary, what does it mean? -- Can't you? Oh
It means shit. The expression is like saying, I don't give a damn. But, anyway
oh, remember they are recording it!
Just imagine, it's recorded then. So --
It already stopped?
No, not yet, when it will stop, a voice will sound, there will be a recording that will say, say goodbye, this is ending, and there's fifteen minutes in total, so you calculate.
Well, when -
Quick, quick.
So when it finished recording, well, I-
Well you say goodbye, and there you go.
I say goodbye and there it is?  or I say, goodbye.
Well yeah, when it cuts of, it cut off and so, well, I was thinking that for these students, they won't find a nicer recording.
Well I can say, goodbye, to my dear public, no?
Sure in the end, when, when-
Well, the truth is that I don't car-
Good, girl.
Well, you know that I have a lot of sympathy towards the American public -
Yeah.
I have everything, because there everything works.
Let's see if they'll give you a grant, eh?
Well, well I hope they give it to me, that they give it to me because the truth is that the American people have never had a better publicist than be because-
and to me, since when I was fifteen they called me the yankee, well.
Look at that.
Because I really loved American things, and the truth is that -
Great.
I like the American people a lot, they have great virtues in the world, it's a large worker, so it's --
Believe it.
Imagine, so, then, I like it a lot, aside from the -
Good.
ah, well, good, yes, I like the American people and I like .
Well, that much we've learned, man, that much we've learned.
Right, but it's not a rally, it's the truth, hey.  Look, hopefully these people who want to say rallies won't know about it.
Nothing, and then, don't worry, they'll learn.
I would really like to have Celix's bible.
Ah, yeah?
Yes, but I can't ask her, have you asked your father for something?
No, because I haven't talked with him for about three weeks or so, because since I was running, running with the thesis --
well the weekends have flown by for me, I didn't remember to call or anything -- when I remembered, it was really late.
And, yeah, no?  And it finished for you?
Well, I have everything written here in a rough draft, now they have to revise it, make corrections, and so, no?  but this is better so working less with your brain, you don't have to think very hard to make the corrections.
So --
Look, Gloria, Maria sent you some pendents --
Ah, yes?
you know, with a letter from Marilina --
I see
so, I'd like to have a Bible, why don't you ask for one for you.
Well, I'll ask for one but they'll believe that they I've contracted a huge case of religiosity, but no
No mam, you know that I do believe in those things, I've live through so much, I don't know how someone like me believes in God, if you don't die
and then all the religions, I don't know if it's okay for me to say it but I don't think that any religion, they all make the sinner feel guilty
Look.
and I'm not guilty of anything, I'm not a sinner, I'm as good as the bread.
Look.
So, it's like
Well, that's why, don't worry, I'll speak to whoever I need to to ask for one.
Hey, it's just that every time that I think of Puerto Rico, and she, she's not there, it doesn't have the same meaning.
Sure, and so.
So, I feel empty when I think of that.
Well.
So, come
Well, woman, don't be such a wiener.
Hey, why do you say those words
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, they won't know what you are speaking of. Clarify the meaning of the word pachunga.
P, oh, that way they'll realize that Spanish is a language that is continually evolving.
Ah, yes, we have a language, also we the Andalusian are the people who speak the best Spanish language - see that. From the ancient Castilian there are unknown words, we are continually taking--
continually old words from the Castilian that are so pretty.
That is true.
Like "envagnecer", see, I want to say that word, "envagnecer", that is a word seldom used and it is when a person is very thin and suddenly begins to get like that --
eh, more glossy, it means that has "envagnecido" and that he looks fine --
Very good.
because you know the proverb, give me fat and I will give you beauty, but of course people don´t have to take that so seriously.
This recording is priceless.
This is like to get "envagnecido" but with moderation.
Hey the last day, do you know what I did, I made a chickpea stew that I have nor ate long ago. They came out very good.
But it would be the ones that are sold in cans, right, already soaked?
Yes, they are canned and yes, you clear them with some water and then you put them in a pan. No, well, I take out the stock they have, it's a bit bad
and it turned out fine. Now that we were just talking about obesity and beauty, I remembered about the chickpeas.
so you know, you must have felt good, sure, a chickpea makes you gain half a kilo.
Oh, that's
Maria is the one that prepares them here, why are you going to go to explain
Well, you are now making fun
And then what about that noise, it's a sound from Andalucia, it seems like, but the sound of the j is so vulgar
They already know that, these people know about it, these people are students, they know all that woman.
That the h, has a sound, it's so vulgar when we say, jace?
Man, those are characteristics of the Andalucia language, dialect or whatever, don't, don't worry about those things. You see, I was forgetting something that I wanted to ask you

but if you want a ninety five, a ninety five and the ninety four, ninety three
It's ninety five.

Yes.
Yes.
No, I tell you, I bought a ninety five once, man, it's really full --
No, it's the same shit.  Here it's the same shit, the same crap.  The same thing for one or two years.  The difference is really little.  Hey --

Okay.
so, it's depressing. But wait, it's going to get better, so, they will say, look, Monica is okay, now. I taped the whole cassette because if I didn't, all of you'd get depressed.
Oh, man! Did you speak to Lola or not.
No.
No?
No, no, I don't know what I'll do, it doesn't make too much sense now.
Mmm.
I don't know, I don't feel like it. Do you know what I dreamed the other night?
What?
I feel bad for having dreamed that but I dreamed that I cheated Matus, fat cow.
Oh.
I swear to you, I was
Mina called.
Oh?
Mina from Bariloche called Matus.
Really?
I swear.
Oh, and the other one that they'll give each other.
Yes, yes, what happened was that their schedules didn't match but they were going to have Monday or Tuesday in their schools so
Mmm.
they were going to meet.
Look at that, how nice. I felt really guilty when I woke up. I felt really bad
Poor you!
But well, how are you, friend?
Me here, I'm doing it for Martin's birthday, which is today.
Ah, today it's his birthday.
Yes, that's why I was taking a bath, for that event.
Ah. How is it going with him.
Fine, fine, more or less
.
He's going through a bad time, and I'm at my best time.
Ah, Carel
This,
what?
plus you know that, did you ask your brother about Manuel?
Yes.
And?
He told me, ah he's a really good guy, really great Ah, I love him, because I also liked Mariana, he tells me how nice, how great, he tells me, that
he says he's really good, he's the salt of the earth.
Really?
That he was his friend, but suddenly, since Victor is like three or four years older than him,
Yes.
at the moment he was a friend, but in the club, when they were there, they didn't go out because he was on another wavelength.
Yes.
But all the same he always seemed like a good guy.  And what happened?
Ah.  Tomorrow is the Reunion Festival in Bariloche
Ah.
And he won't go and I'll be desperate, then.
Hey, Tati!
What?
What!  Son of a Bi-!
I'm not made of ice, man, I'm human.
And, you can see that you're not good with Martin, son of a bitch!
I'm fine, he's not fine.
Yes, you're really good.  You, as someone in love, you don't seem like it.
NO, it's not this.  Aye, so.
And and but what's more, Martin, when you got back together you were good, but you don't seem as united as before.
I don't know if it's passing or not, but I'm on the other.  I'm in the moon of Valencia, I can explain it to you.
Being in school is one thing.
The, the, hmm, school doesn't exist, I sleep in all my classes, all of them.
.
All.  The other day we came back at one in the afternoon, and we left at four, Barros and me, and we slept, mom came and woke us up, girls you have English, she told us.
.
no, everyone's boring, no one cares about anything, no one's interested in anything.
Aye, my God, aye aye aye.
Boluda, you know what.
What.
that Jedy is the coordinator on his own, did you know?
Yes, Tati told me on the microphone.  And she told me that they said that, even Nelly, they were slept together.
Well, well, he wasn't only with this one, he was with four or five coordinators.  Carolina too, Geraldina.
Aye -
she was with Jose actually.
Man, yes I knew but, they didn't do anything, he said.  He was Geraldina's boyfriend.
I don't know, like, they were the root of ] No, you also thought that it was the boyfriend, it wasn't the boyfriend ].
Ah, they spoke in code.
So there isn't, huh?
Did they speak in code?
Who?
Geraldine and Paula.
Why?
because they told me that it was the boyfriend.
Oh yes, the boyfriend of Geraldine was in Bariloche. But I didn't get into their room, and there was a guy half naked turning then, in the bed with Geraldine
So, I didn't know if that was the boyfriend, I left at that very moment, but oh, it was José
Oh, it was José!
Yes, jerk
Oh, my God, But what do they say? did she finally go to bed with that Marcelo or not?
It looks like she did. She didn't tell me, but everybody says she did
Mmm. Oh, that girl.
And then there was Gabriela Karganski, she conned both of them, drunk, Diego Cantillano and Roman
No
Roman wants to cut off one testicle, jerk, it looks like
Poor guy, he is absolutely --
the thing is that she was about to have intercourse with Roman
Uh, he is repentant, Roman
And Roman didn't remember anything, anything, he was so drunk
Oh, come on
No, I swear, they told me the other day
Yes, he doesn't want to remember, you jerk
Gabriela, it seems that Gabriela wrote him a letter
then she is
Because Gabriela wanted him to leave his girlfrined
Hmm.
So what, Che, Did you know that Orlando Roman is in his house?
How?
Because the parents  are separated.
Oh, they separated.
Yes, well. The father made a really big shit.
What he did.
You shut up, don´t tell a thing. But, they won the trial, the insurance of Marcelo because of the accident.
Aha.
And with that money they were going to pay the apartment where they are living now, that they have not paid, and a  day before Roman´s mother noticed that the money had disappeared,the father had spent it all in a business, trying to duplicate it, I don´t know the story.
Ouch.
It was seventy thousand dollars, woman. What a huge amount!
Oh, And besides, obviously, didn´t enjoyed it, nothing.
No, no. So what, and Romy is with a depressive attack, I swear it, I see him very bad.
Ah, you see him frequently.
Eh. He was the other day at the school. He does not talk and I met him on Sunday at night when we were coming back from the airport.
Hmm.
Well I knew he was bad, Reyes had told me, I called him, we met, he told me -- And, well no, I did not see him anymore. He talked on the phone.
Hmm.
Nothing, more.
Ah. Send her my regards.
Mm.
I already sent the pictures to get developed.
Ah, me too, and I forgot to go get, I mean, the time went by and the business closed and I haven't been able to go get them.
What a jerk. With your parents, how are you.
With my parents, with my dad, really good, I mean, quite good, with my mom, I'm fine, but I'm worried about my mom.
She's doing bad.
Eh?
She's sick.
Very sick. I swear, I'm worried.
Mm.
No, I don't know what to do because, I was telling that the other day to my dad, I'm like alone, I have nobody whom I can turn to, nor with whom to share, you understand?
Yes, no, no, I swear --
Ah, no friend of your mom, someone who's also that nearby.
No, I mean, I mean, I'm alone, if my mom is sick, my mom doesn't have a husband, nor does she have another kid, understand?
Sure.
Listen and I'm Argentinian, I have to go.
You feel responsible.
I'm very, yes, I feel I have too big of a responsibility.
Mm.
So.
What happens is that you don't have to take it, I mean, you're taking it as a responsibility.
Is that it's inevitable, dummy.
But it's inevitable, but I swear that you will have to make an effort to separate it, Tati, otherwise.
Yes, but for example today, today I was lying down here about to go to sleep in the afternoon, she called me that she was sick, that she couldn't move, to go take her the medicine and I don't know what, and I had to stay the whole afternoon taking care of her.
And what did she have.
And see, no she's eighty years old, that, well, and my grandmother, my grandmother never does it.
But, why couldn't she move.
Well she got an attack in the liver and she couldn't move from the bed, she was a piece of crap.
Seriously, or she's too
And I don't know, see.
You think
I think so, that seriously, what happens is psychological from here to China, don't you see?
Sure, I mean it's kind of, if you don't come to me, I die. Fine that - That doesn't help you get rid of the
Yes, but I don't know if she does it on purpose or she does it unconsciously, but or, I mean, psychologically it's obvious, understand, I don't know if she does it consciously or unconsciously.
but I can't say no, understand.
Sure, in that situation no, it's hard. But, it's hard.
So
But no, you can't, as much as, that no, you're not you know, you feel you can't, I mean, you have to help yourself, not feel responsible, because it's not what, I mean
No, responsible no, I mean I don't feel guilty, but I feel responsible.
No but, I mean, it's just like you, in this moment, you can't help your Mom, even if you want to you can't so she has to take care of herself.
Yes, but I'm still worried, I talked to her the other day and I was really worried, do you understand?
. Yes, yes, I understand, I'm learning. But, yes.
So, that. Hey, and how are you doing with Jorge?
Oh, I, he's not in the right age. We are not super
In the best moment, actually.
Sure, super communicative, and warm, but he's calm, what do I know, so so. I mean, we are not, not creating
Can I tell you something, because of the trip.
No, no, no, we don't talk at all, the only thing he said was that, he said it but he was trying for me to listen to it, that I should've gotten there a week earlier.
But he just mentioned it like trying to get me to hear it. But no, we don't argue, lets say, no.
It's okay.
What do I know. I found out that there's a Brazilian girl in school.
What, what?
There's a Brazilian girl in school, a new girl, she doesn't speak English.
Oh, really?
I'm going to try to
Yes, what about the enrolling, are you doing it?
Yes, I know that I'm doing it but I don't know, unless I'm doing really bad.
Yes, why.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I might. The History professor saw me in the hallway the other day and she said Monica, where have you been
I was looking and waiting for you because you hadn't arrived, and I don't know what else.
.
Like, they do treat me well, I have to do the first part of the course and then, she was like, okay, fine
Yes, they gave him a visa, but they gave it to him for three months.
To where, Canada or the United States.
Eh, to the United States.

He told you?
What a dare, I didn't, I said, well, he told me, we have to talk and joke.
Aye, why?
I didn't do anything, like, she treated me well and everything but she said, I didn't like it, I felt bad.
That, why, she scared you?
No, not scared, if I talked, I don't know what she has to tell me, like
Ah, okay, that's fine.  Well, today, ah?  ah, tell me.
Look, fatty, I was going to tell you, I was going to tell you, I was thinking about what you told me about the --
Aha.
bank, I have all the papers ready, I have one here in the backpack, but the others
Ah, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, in any case it's like, it's like five dollars, it's bullshit, it's like one thousand bolivianos, that's it, like, don't worry.
But you don't need the papers, being there --
No, no, it's fine, no problem.  I talked with the bank and they're going to take half, I went to the bank today and I have enough money.
Hmm.
So, I did everything, I went to class -

So, hey, girl, I was in a class, I was talking with a professor, I wanted to get into a class, but it's only for those who already graduated, who are there to do the, a class of --
Okay.
and, and, and the professor told me, 'I think that since we have a great student', or some joke like this ', I will allow you --
to get in my class and I will send a letter to the dean for you to get in my class', listen, I felt so small in that class
eh? aha
Oh, I mean, it is --
It is like an auditor
No, no, taking the course, like the rest
OK
Super, I mean, interesting joke
That's it, darling
So, well, I was so happy and everything was fine, I finally can take all my classes, now everything is alright -- and well, what else?, mm, I wrote, I was writing a letter to Matox, telling him what I was doing --
Ok, listen, you have the same address, right?
Yes, the same one, the same one
Ok, as soon as I get there I will write to you and send you some for matox, and I will send --
Aha, ok. Then I will send to matox tomorrow
OK
and so, well, I think he would have it -*-
But with your address, right? in case he wants to write back
I will put both addresses, yours and mine, let him decide
So, if there is anything, he can write to you, and you tell me, or give him the telephone number in Merida, will you dad?
Yes, right. Yes, darling, I won't writ-
Write down the teleph-, in the letter, write down Merida's phone number and tell her that she can call me, joke and all of that.

Of what.
The offer of that
Yes, sure, from Venezuela to, yes. Let's wait.
Well, any thing I'll always call after twelve, for anything, did you hear me?
Sure, exactly, exactly, and you can call me at whatever time you want because now I have my own room like before, in other words, if you call me at three in the morning, four in the morning, five in the morning, it doesn't matter.
Ah, okay.
You call me, and well, I should be here, so.
Okay.
Because I, usually after seven at night, I should be here in my room,

My love, I adore you, honey, I adore you a lot.
I've spend all day thinking about you, love.
Really? it could be you have nothing to do there in Paramon
It could be love, that I cut my hair.
You cut your hair?
Yes.
But a lot.
Yes.
But short.
No, short, no.
Ah, ah.
I cut like six fingers.
You overdid it.
Ah.
I don't care, like that it's better because like that no one is looking at you, ha ha ha.
Ah, you, it came out fine, listen.
It came out nice, that!
I went to leave the bangs with the part underneath.
Ah, okay, that's great, baby.
I have it long underneath.
Yes, ah.
It is that you did not see that my hair was dry, not now, right now there is not --
Yes, yesm it was very dry, and --

Yes.

How come,

Fat, oh man, fat. Oh, mommy, I love you a lot, baby. I am happy, everything has gone fine, everything has gone fine to me. everything, everything, so, the classes, everything, I am very happy, what I know is that the classes are going to be very difficult, and I am not going to have time for nothing, to for nothing, for nothing, and now with this class that --
Well, even to go to Montreal, right?
nothing, I have not time for anything, I tell you that even on weekends I have not time for anything, so, from now to December, complete studying until December.
well, in December, yeah, in December I go on vacations, come back and that is all, it is over. So, I don't have time for anything else, not for playing, for nothing. All the classes I choose are very difficult. So I didn´t take any easy class because I want, damn, at least to have something, to get graduated and know what I am doing and I don't want easy classes, no like this.
Okay.
So, but the teacher told me, but well, you have finished, all the classes are ready, all the difficult classes are ready, now why you don't get easy classes, and that is all --
that if photographs, do you see the stupid, I want other classes, but difficult, from other careers, other things, but I want more, more classes --
You would get graduate, Can you take another classes?
Yes, is that I finished all my classes, what I am taking now are extra classes, yeah.
And that?
Yes, I, I am already graduated from, marketing I am already graduated.
Aha.
Well, and finances, the difficult classes I have already taken them, now what I have to do is to take the elective classes, they call them like that.
Okay.
I can take whatever I want, but I'm going to pick something difficult, and well, that's it.
Okay.
It's going to be, that way I can get distracted, I'm always studying and joking and the professors, they are really cool, I'm fine, I'm really happy.
Yes, well, I got the good news about the money that I'm going to get next week, it's around four hundred dollars.
Oh.
and wit that, I can pay, I still need money to pay the phone and I will get some money to survive till next month.
Oh, okay.
Oh, my love, my love!
Oh.
I love you so, so, so, so much.
Me too.
Oh, we'll see each other soon, baby. Did you tell your dad, about our joke, that you are coming over for my graduation?
No, I didn't, nor him nor my mom.
Oh.
because they were speaking to my Aunt Nory and
About what.
I left-
Oh.
I wake up around twelve today, I slept a lot.
Good heavens, how hard, right, your life, ah.
well, almost at twelve, then I went to Ramon, and I was there, and he cut the hair and I don't know, I got here a while ago and with my aunt Nora we made some really delicious cookies.
Aha.
Love, I make a cake that came out delicious, delicious.
Yes, my love.
And I did it with the exact measurement, the cake --
Ah.
measure, and then like that it came out good. Ah, Tinso I feel bad about the horrible cake I made for your last year.
What happened, what
Ah, no, it came out horrible.
Not true, it came out delicious.
It came out horrible, Tinso
Not true, not true, not true, it came out very delicious.
Yes I know that it came out bad.
No, no, it came out
But, well, I already know what is the --
Girl, what I haven't missed, right, thank God. I was already tired of the arepas, ah.
Yes, love.
Yes, I couldn't eat anymore arepas in my life, I'm not eating anymore arepas until next year. Don't you think we ate a lot of arepas.
Well, what happens is that, ah Tinso, yes here in Venezuela you always eat arepas.
Eh, I'm sure happy here, I returned to my normal life, I had four months that no, I love my room, my room --
yes but there's something
me waiting to see if something hooks there
okay, that at any moment you get something
Sure, see, but for now is all to clean the registers of the Municipality
mm
So for now by there nothing happens
but with time it'll come out
yes, yes, uncle. And kids?
yes Not yet
Ah?
Not yet
Not yet?

yes, a boy. He's five months
two boys ah, he's already five months
yes, he was born five months ago
oh, he is a little baby
yes, he was born on the twenty-fifth, the twenty-fifth of, wait, let me think about it, March. It is still so new, I must process it properly
Elisa, how is she doing?
Fine, she's fine, she keeps working in the same place
yes
And well, fine, fine
Good
we live here with my mother, you know, and my sister
yes, yes
we deal with the expenses all together, you know
your brother, did he go to Canada at the end?
eh?
your brother, didn't he go to Canada?
No, no, no. No, he hasn't finished what he was doing, he never finished it
oh, didn't he?
no, because you know, I mean, he has more work but he doesn't do it, you know, he just goes forward
Sure
And, you know, he hasn't finished yet, so he doesn't really know, you know
I am
And mmmm no]
I am about to begin to study again
there?
yes
What are you going to study?
hey, systems
systems?
hmm
that is good
and I am practicing here see, with programming language and everything else
yes
and I am very busy with that now
what, are you in a laboratory?
No, what a laboratory, at home
wait Do you find me a pen? Elisa is giving to me a pen
yes. I do all at home
All at home?
yes, yes
so you are in the first world
yes
ah?
I had a scholarship
you have a machine?
I'm connected with the Internet and all
how is it
is great
I wasn't able to buy the machine yet, crazy
I bought it used
yes
some three eighty six, old
yes
but it's enough, it's going well
I, I, I work now with this guy's machine, see
yes, that has
I made him buy one of these and he spent all the cash, see
yes
he bought a four eighty six with all bells and whistles, sixteen mega roms, a hard disk of five hundred C of of
all
eh, two accelerating local platelets
modem?
modem, we have it but we haven't installed it yes because we have some there to connect everything, because this guy travels a lot, see
to convince him to find an account with internet
to find?
an an account with internet
Internet
yes, is the international net there is yes, there are two companies that offer it, one is Satlink
Satlink
and the other one is CompuServe
ah, CompuServe
I
ah, yes it sounds familiar
when you get with them, they give you access to the internet
aha
if you get with those, and you have access, I have access too, we can communicate by by mail, like that
yes by mail with the machines
yes
of course, I have to find the trick, so he can see it and
See it
I convinced
I with internet get communicated with every place
yes
with all the universities have, for example, internet access
aha
of that I tell you, my cousin in Italy, he is in Padua University
yes
then I communicate through that here inside the United States you communicate with all the world
of course
with people from Argentina I am also in contact
yes yes
and and I know that in Argentina have that Satlink
and
and the the it looks like it was the most important
yes, no no, no, it must be working with the telephone company it sounds, it sound familiar
see
but I did not see it
I even know that some state agencies have internet access
aha that is good
so because of that you can
Hmm,yes that is what I find useful because he travels a lot, see it, now the last time he traveled he went to to Cuba and after that he went to Miami
Hmm
he bought some things of these that we put into the machine.
Yeah
he's always shopping, i don't know, he brought one of those, uh, ¿what's it's name?
catalogs
No, dude, no catalog, no, something else, he's bringing a BM from Germany now, and, ¿what's it called?, this thing, to ride in the water, a set of Skies
but the dude is loaded with money
Yeah, he's full of it
and, well, it's OK
he's got a treasure
that, convince him that, Satlink charges only twenty seven dollars a month
¿huh?
for service
yeah, yeah, i want to convince him to give me a loan, yeah, i run out of
No, well, dude
¿huh?
right know, you can hook up with him, like a counselor or something, an advisor
no, you, he's figured me out, you see
¿why?
i mean, he uses me for everything he has to do and he gives you a fixed amount of money, more or less
well, but you
yeah, more or less, sometimes that money saves me, so it's too much, i can't tell you
but you could get involved with the computing in the computer
yes, now the one who uses it there is me, see it
because of that and you could follow
of course, but, so, he, according to him, I am his partner according to him, isn´t that true?
the balls
of course, more than balls, the issue is the following, so, until now all I have seen are numbers in loss
of course
see it, without nothing
so you are a partner in looses
of course, do you notice it, then we have to see what happens even, is so heavy that thing that he is considering whether to continue or whether to give up
because if for September things do not get better, because you, the taxes are sent well, all the zone taxes are sent
yes
to charge them
yes
Did you see it, then well, we work, eh, we did it right here, suppose it, they begun I think with two hundred - two hundred sixty attorneys in capital
yes
so, the zone we have is to Urquiza
ah
and almost to Chacarita
yes
even the and even Constitution
yes
in in in five days we did two thousand seven hundred summons
aha
when he went to the meeting of attorneys they had all done one hundred, one hundred twenty they couldn't believe it, see
look, you
and, but like that also were the people that were the people that started to fall imagine, half the people, all mad because they were asking them for taxes that already, cars from thirty years ago that were transferred
that don't exist anymore, see, a tire! tremendous, then see, the man came mad, like that
ah, but look
more, more, more for good than for bad
for now it's the best thing you have, right?
and yes, and if not I handle myself see, with administration, of consortium
ah
I have two, I have two, yes and other works that appear but that also, see, this one has good work in two months
sure
and later then girl then you never saw, you never know how much cash you're getting in the month
sure
and also that here everything is legal, see, that you have the VAT, that you have the I have an accountant to whom I have to make payments a month
ah, you have to have all your things in order
sure, otherwise, you can't work
sure
so hmm and you have, you always have to be authorizing everything and there are things that, well, I tell you, I started two months ago
look, everything increases
yes
and just two months ago I thought, well, in the end it will start to stop, there was a violent dive, people didn't have a cent, jobs were cut, a disaster
so, so everything was screwed?
huh?
so screwed
it's what happened, you see, we entered into a crazy recession, you see, people didn't have anything, look, this guy has eeeee a Mercedes, Paolita
yes
that he wants to sell, he has a Mitsubishi, this little truck
yes
it's the nice one, I think it's the wagon
yes, yes
that he wants to sell.  Today he sold a Fiat for one thousand five hundred, no, one thousand five hundred, a newer model, like a little truck
aha
that was impeccable, he sold it for five, he sold it for four fifty, you see, to get some cash, you see, to
yes, to get some money
because, after he has a, he got it and with this he can buy a truck that's a bit bigger, like, I tell you, a lot of offers that I see, he puts up and people don't even come, because they don't have a cent
and so
Dude, Carlitos
the, the last ones
Uh, before it gets disconnected, why don't you give me your data
Seven, two, four
seven, two, four
south
yes
just put the S, and, uh
it's done, it's there, don't worry
oh, well, now, the street's name is C-R-O
C-R-O
W-N
W-N
And a second word, pointe
pointe
and then
right
D R, like doctor
yes
of
right
it's the city, then comes A-N-A
yes, i have that
California, C A
California, United States of America
exactly
yes
and then nine two eight zero seven
nine two eight zero seven
that's the zip code
the zip code, seven, and the phone, you also have
the phone, yeah
to call it, i
it's another thing that I want to tell you, that's more important, and it's the following
Yes
you are already receiving the
Yeah
Okay, in, in various numbers behind the
Yes
the Nations, the United Nations took out some ads
Ah
about
I was going to tell you this, about people in Political Science
exactly
all these things
exactly, did you see it?
Yes
Okay, so I sent to ask for some applications to apply to this thing
sure, of course
but what happened, someone told me here, an El Salvadorian who worked in the United Nations before
Yes
that to apply to the United Nations, the best thing is always to have leverage
Aha
I wanted to know if you know someone who works in the United Nations
look, in the United Nations, I´m totally lost because I don´t know anyone, Carlos
I see
you know, just now I was seeing that ad, but the only problem is, have you seen it?
yes, yes, I saw it, yes, that´s why I´m telling you
it, it, it says that, that it requires five years of field work
sure, yes, that, but
experience, practice
sure, but you can, a teacher told me to apply, that when the United Nations want to give someone a job
Ah, I see. I see.
everything else doesn´t matter, right
Yes, sure, sure. Look, and Saul doesn´t have any contacts there
No, he know someone in Venezuela, but that person in Venezuela can´t do anything, this is New York
Ah, really, yes. And what about Roberto?
I haven´t asked Roberto
maybe he has a friend there, something, because
yeah
yes, look and
Yeah
and you didn´t become friends with the ambassador from Salvador, Ricardo Castañeda
Sure, it seems he's still in New York, he's the permanent representative
Of course he's still in New York
still in New York, so i thought about calling him
why don´t you give him a cal- why don't you give him a call man
Yeah, I'll give him a call, i'll give him a call
you, you sort of know him, ¿right?
well, yeah, sort of, he told me that if i wanted to get into the INCAE, he could get me in, i imagine that means
maybe he remembers you, man, oh, well, so go and tell him, "look, I'm finishing my major"
Right
here in Political Sciences at this university
Yes
i have applied and I'm gonna ask you to help me, uh, for references or something
sure, sure,
¿right?
yeah
Sure, look, go there and talk to him, can't hurt to try
Yes, yes, yes
Don't be afraid, ¿right?, because
but i need, but i need more references, ¿who else?, ¿who else do you think i can point from El Salvador?
uh, from El Salvador, wait a minute
I had thought about engineer Reyes, but that, that
look, but Reyes is an unknown man already at those levels,
Well, but yes, but he's in Fusabe
Well, then put him right, I think that in case they ask you for references, yes
And, another person close to you who could be useful in this case
Eh
more eh, more eh, at a governmental level
at a governmental level of now, since I'm totally out and other people
Aha
eh, really I can't think of anyone at this moment, to say well really
and the ambassador in the OAS don't you say he's a friend of yours, Andino
Ah, well, he is a friend of mine, sure, yes
Aha
Roberto Andino, why don't you put Roberto Andino
Roberto Andino,
and talk to him - look
Aha
you can call Roberto Andino and tell him, look
Aha
my father is so and so and knows you
Aha
and he told me that he would talk about soliciting cooperation in this sense
Yeah
and I told him, look, I'm getting my Masters in Political Sciences but clarify yourself, identify yourself, you know
Sure, sure
I think Roberto is a good person, he can help you
And Roberto, you know Roberto Rosales
I don't think so, I don't think so
You don't think so, ah
No, no, no I don't think so, and since Roberto is so restrained, he's not really hurt, no
Yes, he's screwed
and the thing isn't like that, right?
Sure, sure
he has to be thrown
Yes
but talk to Roberto and tell him this, that he knows me
Yes, yes, yes
right?  Jose Maria Rosales, who worked for a while in the Foreign Ministry, in the central bank, he will, he will give
Exactly and, and, and
right?  So you have both
and this Fred Unger would be, he would be a good voice too or not
Well, if you talk to him and tell him
Aha
I believe that it might help you
I see
because you shouldn't tell him the case, just talk to him
Oh, I see, okay, well, I'll call him, I had planned on calling him
Sure, you do these calls and
Aha
it's easier, right, and
I see
and you look, this is how it is and this
And do you know if the people in El Salvador know about all these job offerings?
Look, the problem is that, lots of people, I mean, you get to know
the
the magazine, right?
Aha, aha
but the problem is that you need a little bit of, knowledge about the language
Sure
and to be interested in those things and I believe that it's not, the Economist is not an extremely popular magazine in here, right?
Sure
look that I had already seen that ad and was going to tell you
Aha
eh I had thought because really, right, it could be interesting, right?
There are two ads
Now that
There are two ads
Hello
There are two ads, first one came out where they were favoring the Salvadorans
Ah
but I don't have the age
Let's see
because you need to be less than thirty two by the thirty first of December of nineteen ninety five and I just turned thirty three
anyway they told me that
less, less than, less than thirty five, less than thirty five
less than thirty three, than thirty two, sorry
ah, but look, that would be but I think that you can fix it
The what
eh, eh, that small difference can be fixed I mean
how
because the thirty five, how old are you going to be? Thirty three?
no no no no, it says that I can't be over thirty two by December thirty one of nineteen ninety five, but I'm now thirty three, oh?
okay, lets see how old well, but it's just by a small difference, I don't think they'll be extremely
well, anyway, Fernando Flores is also here
Aha. Yes
I had already told you about him
Yes
he said, look, he told me, you should apply for both things, nothing,
sure, sure, sure, sure
you don't loose anything, right? He too, he's also a friend of Andino
Oh, how
so, maybe he
oh, maybe through him you can talk to Andino and tell him
Sure, maybe, maybe he's got Andino's house number in Washington, right?
Exactly, sure, sure
Sure
Sure. And if you can't, you should ask at the OEA for his phone number.
I see
and maybe they can tell you how you can contact him
Sure
Right, well, look, and, ¿how's that graduation thing turning out?
Yeah, look, the graduation, the ceremony is in Ma- sorry, in November
Sure, ¿what date in November?
I don't know yet, they don't know, because that doesn't, they don't know that upfront
Because i want to go to Canada this year
Right, right
But, if i can do it for a more [...] reason, i mean, that i can take advantage of an event like that, i could, and if not
Right
i might do it sooner, ¿you know what i mean?
Right. Let's do one thing, look, when i went to register for the graduation, they told me that they knew it was in November  but they didn't have a candidate date
Right
so, let me find out and I'll let you know the date they decide
Well, yeah because i wanted to be there then, but
Oh, right
But that's, that's
No, that's in October, yeah
October, you know, sure, it's gonna be like, it's gonna be like October thirteen, i think
Yes, i think so, yes
More or less, well
Yes
then already, already you couldn't
Okay
because I have, my plan would be to be between eighteen and twenty days in Canada
Okay
spread with all of them, with Ceci and possibly time will run out but that gives me a stretch to
to Washington
to Ci-no, to Cincinatti
Ah, to see my aunt
because I'm going to go with
Okay
Yes, because to Cincina- because to Washington I was thinking of moving it- leaving it perhaps for next year like in May
Sure, sure Okay
because I can't cover so much, you understand me
Okay, okay okay
and because I would have to because Tenchita wouldn't come with me but rather she want us to meet in Miami, perhaps eh for some ten or twelve days
Sure, sure, yes, yes, yes, okay
on the way back, right, then that's the thing
Okay
And what about, and what about, and How is Nury, is she okay?
She's fine, she sends her regards, she starts classes on Tuesday
Ah, Ah, and and what is she going to study
she's going to do a postgraduate in Public Administration
ah, postgraduate in Public Administration and I was trying was trying to remember that she wanted to study public
Aha
but that doesn't break your plans, already. Carlos?
what plans, if right now we don't have any plans
I mean in case that of the United Nations comes up
Ah well, is that if it comes up is an important opportunity, sure, sure
Yes is good, is good, sure, because if it was in New York she could also study
well yes, yes, that's what I tell you. No, that's not a problem.
Sure, sure Ah, she already agrees and all
Yes, yes, yes of course. of course
Ah well, perfect, sure well she's not going to
well, but also to see how feasible that opportunity will be
Look I was thinking something else Rober- Carlos, look what you can also do
Aha, aha
is because I've seen that they do it, right
Aha
is let's say, get also in that of teaching, perhaps not in Canada.
Aha
but in the same United States, because you know that in the United States
Aha
there are universities of first, of second, of third, of fourth, of fifth, of sixth, of eight, yes, there's of everything so
aha, yes yes
you have to be frank, see
What is that
There's of everything, there are all types of universities
Yes
In some they demand a doctorate, in others they don't demand a doctorate, you understand me
Mm
but that career at least to start, could be nice, man
Yes, yes, yes
And teaching is not paid badly in the United States
Yes, yes
all you could apply for let's say some ten universities, such as I've seen people do, right
Aha
that apply to ten universities, or to twenty universities
Aha
but I'm graduating in this and I'm willing and to teach in the department of Political Science, well
Sure, well I'm going
Listen, look, I had asked for the number and the number they had given me didn't work, so I had you in mind to call you
Ah, really?
ah, and now when I arrived, I found your letter, so I said I'm going to call her
Ah, Margarita
you see, we've both had each other in the memory
Alright, you already see how
Listen and the skinny guy, did it go okay?
it went very well, he was

He brought a new harp. You don't know, that he went up to Paraguay
Mm
From Paraguay he traveled to Mexico, he comes came delighted and fat, with three extra kilos
fat fat, I can't
yes, he came fat, how do you see
Ah Carmela, he looks like he's pregnant yes he's fat
Pregnant. Yes, he says he ate everything, the weather was very good, he was with the kids, with the siblings No, now he did come back really, really, really full of everything
How nice
then already, I hope he gets rid of that obsession that he had of staying a long time in Chile, he stayed there three months
Three months
And so then he was very good. He says that the weather, there was a lot of sun
Yes
I went to visit his parents
Yes, but my parents were very sad, because my dad says that the kinesiology was working with my mother
Aha
and and she couldn't move
Ay
and he vi- was there for a moment and said he would be back and never came back
No, he says he never came back, yes, yes
OK
Ramon says that he couldn't come back because he had to travel, that he went very far away, that he was in, I don;t know, he was only in Chile, that he went up to Montt Port, that he was everywhere
OK
well very good, he didn't get sick with that cold weather, well it's very cold down there
well, it's winter time
Yes, and he bought a -
don't worry, it's someone that is calling me, but I'm not going to answer
Ah, ah, ok. He bought some sweaters that made me sweat when looking at them and he says that he never got sick, not flu nor nothing in spite of the cold weather that was was
tough, right? Look, he wants to say hi to you.
Hello?
How are you feeling dude, well now that I have you I have to tell you chubby
Hello, hello, little chubby. Yes, right now he is some centimeters heavier. Yes, hey and how is your health
More or less, no more
So like always
I'm, look, I'm better, in reality
Yes
but, in any case we'll talk about this later.  Eh, for the letter better, because since this is a recorded thing
Yes
eh, but it went well for you, that's great that it went well for you, hey
Yes, so, I'm happy to talk to you, Margarita, why did you call at this hour when it's more expensive, why don't you call at night
well, no, yes, this is a free call for the, the job, but they're recording
Yes
you know?
Yes
so
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It makes me happy to see you with fair health, because we can't ask for more, I also had some little problems there, they're testing me with the doctor there in the clinic.
Hmmm
and so, it happens to everyone the same
Yes
but this is normal at our age
Yes, well, we're not getting any younger, so
More, that's it, then
as my dad says
you can´t ask for more
As my daddy says, it´s because of old age
Yes
yeah, well, what the hell
then let´s see if you can come here some time
well, look, right now, financially, I can´t do it
Si
Look, I still have a temporary job
Yes
And that´s not a sure thing. Think about Orlando, Orlando is unemployed since last year´s October
Yes, uhm
imagine how we´re all doing here, but, what the hell, maybe I´ll just go to your place
Hmm

Yes, whatever you want, say hi to all your family here

Oh Carmelilla, until I'm able to go.
Oh man, Margarita, man, one day, man
But we will Carmela, my
but now, are you working?
just temporarily, not more, the same job that I've had since this February.
You are not longer with Calleja?
No, it's been years since I'm not with her.
Oh no, she's not, oh that's true
No, I then worked with a woman from Puerto Rico, a real bitch.
Oh yes, the Puerto Rican, that's true, yes, yes
She was a bitch.
a bitch.
yes, and, but since she was going to close the office, well
Aha
she told me that, she gave three months notice which was a great thing
Aha
but, even so, well Carmela, yes here there are no jobs, here the situation is very bad
There look, no more
so then, and then, I who am not young, imagine
Yes, that it already becomes problematic
yes well Carmela, I'm now in November going to be be my good years
Yes
so that, no, well
Yes, well, like in all places, Margarita, when the people pass the forties already the issue of the jobs becomes more complicated
Okay
Yes
So that's
No, man, but let's hope that some day you can come one weekend, man
yes well, it would be ideal Carmela. Perhaps, look, I can get the long weekend in November, for perhaps for the
Ah, Margarita, it would be fabulous
perhaps, if not, maybe for Christmas, who knows, but it's that Carmela you need to have the money to travel
Well, yes
I, look, you can't imagine, I'm at three and at four, you know that
Ah
And then that we have to send money for my parents that here we are all full of problems, that what I make it's not even enough to pay the bills
Yes
imagine, how can I make plans to travel
Yes, listen and Chela? Margarita
Chela, look, yesterday I saw her coincidentally, it had been a long time since I had last seen her. She's really thin
Ah, poor her
No, no, no, she'd done a diet that the doctor gave her because it turns out she has diabetes and I don't know what other problems
Ah
then, she had to lose weight in whatever way
And
and she looks really good
well yes
but, however, her husband, Orlando, he's fat in such a way, I hadn't seen him like that, that he looks like a ball, yes he really is fat like a ball
God
I don't know what has happened to him that he's gained so much weight, he looks horrible!
Ag
And, well, from there well
And now in the morning we got the invitation of the, they are inviting us to the celebration of September the eighteenth with the honorary Consul of Chile here in Monterrey
Hmm
we were last year and now we are invited again
How good, so
that man has a house, it is a palace there in Colonia del Valle, there where live the
Yeah, yeah
the magnates and we all the Chilean join together there and with the new that Adrian doesn´t want to go, may he has done something over there that does not, he acts like he doesn´t know a thing and does not go.
Hmm
I don´t know what, something happens there because he does not want to go because, with those things that he loves like going  to parties and drinking and that
Hmm Don´t worry
Ah, well, go. Is nothing more that it is going to be pretty soon it is going to be on eighth because in September eighteenth, there is going to be, the consul of Chile is going to be in Mexico, his wife and other personalities
they will raffle some tickets from Mexico to Santiago, ah, hopefully we get them and I say to Ramon, Ramon and if we get the tickets? and he says, we leave
and so, yes, so, it is the next Thursday
yeah, there is  also going to be a party here, but I am not going
Aren´t you going?
No,Carmela, the entry costs forty five dollars. I am not going to spend forty five dollars in a party, I cannot do that.
Ouch
Yeah, so it is that, and and they are going to raffle two travel tickets too.
Ah, look that, last year we were told to bring something to the dinner, everyone should bring
Yeah
ah, but that it was Chilean food. I made two kilos of Chilean pies and that's what I took
Mm
and there was food there, but a lot, and now, they don't want us to take anything
Mm
but yes. And even, Leoncio Durandot, do you remember Leoncio Durandot?
Okay
Well, he - I called him because there in the letter they tell us to make extensive invitations to the other Chileans, and Leoncio tells me, listen, why didn't they send me a letter
And they did send Ramon his letter today, precisely, in the morning, it arrived
Mm
So, yes, yes we already talked on the phone that yes, that we were going to attend
how nice
so, I have to take out, I have to dust off the only nice dress that I have, ah
and when is it going to be?
on Thursday, next Thursday the eighth
Okay
then, there. Last year they took a picture of us, and it came out in the newspaper, with the Chilean flag very nice, very nice, there I met, it was there where I saw many Chileans together
Okay
Many, many, many people
How nice
and, in reality the lady, the wife of the honorary consul here in Monterrey is such a refined lady, so pleasant, and she has a house, Margarita, ah, that it's a palace, ah, how fantastic, no, no, no
open a branch in Chile, because in Chile there's no
Ah
this company
Okay
and it's going to open in Chile, Ah? it already opened in Argentina, and then now now it's going to open in Chile and maybe for that, for that reason, he might go
Probably it must be for that
Yes and and they are very interested and, yesterday an Argentinian couple was there that he's a doctor he was talking about this, of, in reality one invests, there's not much capital that you invest
and but, you do get it back quite good you can make good money, so
Okay.
so yes, there we are going to see everything, if maybe it's good for us, or maybe we also get into it, there we'll see
Ah
Sure.
how the issue goes
Sure
Eh mm Here everyone is fine
Listen
Yes eh Eric.
And Orlando is also working?
well, he's always working like that in a temporary way, mom ah
Ah okay,
but maybe this next week, maybe he is going to, going to work Eh in a form more of, yes it looks
more firmly.
Well, the, he passed the application, and the interview, and all but then they told him that they would call him the next week, so lets see it
Ah yeah, hopefully
but you never know, well, mom, eh?
And Miriam? Miriam
Look Christian is fine, I saw him, eh lets see? around a week ago, a little bit more, because the children were here, because his wife was sick in the hospital
Yes
Then she had a surgery and, and she is very sick at night, a , a day they have to take her to the emergency room and then at morning, the, On Saturday two weeks ago.
then eh, Christian had to go, with the three children, so young, there to the hospital.
Ah, yes,
At two in the morning, they were there, at seven in the morning she called me and then brought them here, here and then I took care of them
Yeah.
them the, the day the Saturday and Sunday
How many days?
Eh they were here with me, because their mother was in the hospital, well imagine it No and
Yes, yes
in the weekend, you don´t find anyone to take care of children.
of course
so Christian had to stay at the hospital, so I, we took care of them here, so and later now they sent me a thank you card and
and then they invited us, for Monday which is a  holiday, to go to
Mm
there a while, to have lunch or eat there
Okay
so maybe we'll go a while over there to see them ah
Sure
but he's fine, and, and he's working fine, Christian ah, so he is
yes
now they are she, they just had to operate her, but, but she returns to work on Tuesday.
Okay, and, things are going well for her at work?
And all the kids yes, they are both fine mm, they are fine
listen but and the, listen tell me something about Miriam
Mm Look Miriam is always working, and now , they don't work anymore in because since the classes already started then she had started working, Tuesdays and Thursdays in the afternoon
Yes
But she left it because here in the school they offered her, that if she stays two more hours, in other words from three thirty to five thirty in the afternoon
then she takes care of the kids that stay there in the school that
Ah okay
that they can't go to pick up earlier, let's say ah
Yes, yes
There's a group of kids, like twenty kids that stay there later
I see
So, she gets paid three hundred dollars more to do that, mmm
Oh sure, that's great
so, she had to stay there everyday anyways, mom, because she has to prepare so much material and stuff, oh
Mmm, sure
So, she stayed for one or more hours everyday. So, it was better for her to stay two more hours everyday and she was able to do her same work
and the kids were there, they eat pizza and things like that and she earns three hundred dollars more, mom
Sure, sure
So, it was convenient for her, to have to go two afternoons to work to the shop and then leave at night, well
Mmm I see
and earn less money, earn less money because, because, because, what she was going to earn she's earning it now working at the same school
sure, that was better for her
it was better for her and still she, she had to stay everyday, well, mom
And, how is her health?
oh, just imagine, she's fine mom, fine, that's it, getting ready, bit by bit, for her marriage, so
Sure, when are they getting married?
well, well, in March
Oh in March, hey Cheli, please give Miriam a big hug and lots of kisses
Thanks mom, now, tell me, have you seen my son?
Look, we waited for him last Monday but he didn't show up.
EH
Because since now it's in another sector
Yes
He has another helper
Yes
So that's probably why he didn't come
Yes
But, he's coming here, and he's also going to Graciela's.
Yes, yes, that's what he told me, he sent me a cassette
Yes, and
there I heard my dad, and Nena and Graciela, but I didn't hear you, I don't know why
Listen listen but I also spoke on the cassette of
But what you are saying doesn't come out
Oh
It didn't come out, I don't know why
Mm
But it didn't come out, only dad comes out, then that of Nena and Graciela Ah, so yours doesn't come out, so
Yes
let's see if later you record another cassette again
Sure
to, to, in one that he also talks, because he says nothing mom.
Ah, no
No!
I am going to tell him that too.
So, one in which he talks, so we can hear him
Of course
Of course, and but look he writes every, every week mom, eh
Yes, I was told that, that he writes to you every week
every week, all weeks, and his letters are cute ah very beautiful his letters and loving, Eric is very good listen.
How good daughter. Yes he is very good
Yes, he is a very good child and with a good heart, so I think that, he is going to be fine, and God is going to bless him, for, for
Of course
Because he does not change mom, be far from home for so much time And walking from here to there, and who knows
Yes, of course
No, ah so
And at, at night he must be very tired, well daughter so much walking all the day
But he, is Yes of course, so what, but he is happy with what he is doing and that is the important thing
Yes and
Eh
Look - this thing of be changed is also a good thing, because that way, he is knowing the city well
Sure, besides it seems that now where he's at, there in Quinta Normal, he seems to be well there, ah Better let's say
Yes, yes
Eh with more comforts let's say in the house where he's at now, it seems he's in a better situation, so to speak ah, than the other one where he was before
Yes
eh that though he says that the people are very good where he was, it seems to be that the people are more humble I think
Yes
Eh but that he says that here there are more comforts he says in that other place
Yes, it's like that, ah
I think that maybe eh - better there but but he, he look there he sends us, that he made copies there, some cards that the people there wrote to him.
Yes
Very nice, very loving, all the things, that they wrote him, and, and, they gave them gifts and everything when he moved, they moved him now
Yes
So it seems the people like him a lot mm
How nice, yes
Yes
it might be that look, Graciela is delighted with him
Yes
the same as Nena, but Graciela like doesn't, pass anymore in the house
Yes
so when he goes, he's with her
sure
and talks
yes, besides that she really likes all those gringo things, well mom.
He's very preoccupied, yes well
Oh, he now has, the new partner that he has, he's a gringo, oh
Oh

Yes
Because he stayed there, where he was

Ah, exactly, that day Look, he's fine, he's here next to me, I'm going, I'm going to put him on the phone, so that you talk to him
Okay, mom if I don't get to talk to you again, then I send you a big hug, mm

Yes, yes, in any case, what I will do, I'll send a fax to uncle, with my account number.

We have orientation for new students on September 6th, it's next Tuesday, and then I'll start classes the week after that one.
I have classes during the afternoon and evening. I'm going to have three courses, one from three thirty to four fifty on Mondays and Wednesday, that's it.

Yes, I got the papers, I now have to call the foreign student office and ask them what do I need to translate the vaccination certificate but yes, they told me that was enough
Oh, I was worried about that, please God, let him get the papers that he needs. Well, the lady in there told me that the vaccine was fine, the certificate was okay, as you had requested it. Well, my son, oh
How are things over there, how is my dad, his leg, when is he going to have the surgery?
We are thinking about it, you know that he was against the surgery, so he knows wants to have a new surgery, it's going to be tough, he hurts all the time
I see.
I, I have been sick too with a virus, the one that we are getting now. There's so much rain and I caught a virus that won't leave me alone
My grandmother, how is she?
She's doing a lot better, it's the same, her illness will take her away little by little, just like myself. I'm here, life is leaving me little by little, until God decides to take me.
Until God decides my son, hoping that you can come over in December, God and the Virgin.
Well, yes, I talked to Freddy about doing some business, as the tickets are cheaper if bought in Venezuela, I asked him to buy them from me and then I was going to give him the money in dollars.
Yes, I0m planning to leave on November twenty eight and come back, I'd have to leave Maturin on the first in the afternoon.
A flight to Caracas so that I can fly all that day to Denver and go back to school on the third of January.
So, you are in Denver now, and what about the man you were living with, did he stay over there?
Yes, yes, stays in, there.

For how long did you rent it.
I rented it for a year.
Ah, because Freddy is, he wanted you to live in a couple´s house where he lived there in Denver, three months, but at last he could not communicate with you to tell you, to see if you find.
Yes, he told me something of that, but I stayed in the morning waiting for a call, and, damn, I wanted, I wanted to move - I wanted to travel and let everything in order to sleep quietly
and luckily I left early, because it took me some time where to buy a shower curtain and the foam I am sleeping on.
Foam.
Yes, yes, it is a orthopedic foam, so what I did, I bought that foam, as I do not have a bed, I bought that foam, for a while.
Ah. Ah, ah, yes, the important thing is to sleep well, my son. Because who studies or works must sleep well. It is fine, as everything else it is relative, but the rest it is important to do it right.
And, How do you do with the issue, do you have a refrigerator and everything else?
Yes, yes, I have a refrigerator. I have a stove, so, I have a shelf to keep my clothes, a dresser, if you want to call it like that. I have a desk - and those are, and the kitchen furniture, where you put things and the laundry and that, that is all the furniture I have, nothing more

And you learned quickly
Well, I am, mm, I mean, I have got used to it, to the car, the accelerator and the speeds
Oh, good, that's good, great. I like to hear you are already used to it. So, then
It's just that I don't have too much fuel, and I won't buy more until I get the check
Eh?
Until I get the check, until I get the money
Oh, well, try to save, darling, because you know you are very far away son, I can't send you money here, and then you know about the problems here, with dollars
Yes, yes, I ask for money --
But it is difficult
I ask for money extremely urgently, I can't get it from anywhere else
Yes, well, the problem --
Mm, I won't be able to make international or long distance calls because I don't have the money to contract the service
Oh, my love, then, if I have the number, I will call you. I wanted to call you these days, but -- since nobody has the number and I was asking Freddy, well --
Come here, I'll talk to Freddy and ask him to give me everything, because since he arrived tonight, I will see him in the morning -- and talk to him to fix this matter

Ah, see, but take, even, take the olive oil every night, a little, three drops.
I prefer, I prefer to go there to Maturin and have a check over there, because here it is very expensive. If I go to the doctor here, I cannot go to Maturin.
Ah, well. Meanwhile, do that, Take your drops, that is not make any harm, olive oil is good for the body.
And lemon, also is good. Take some drops of lemon with a chamomile infusion at night, you sleep well -- it has vitamin C don´t neglect that issue.
Maybe it helps something. maybe it does, maybe don´t, but do . the try, do the try that maybe yes.
Don´t neglect that issue because it can be a cold that you have.

Fine, sweetie, fine.  Huh?
A pleasure to hear from you, ah, we were thinking about you, the ingrate, you don't call or a letter, nothing.  What happened?
My daughter, do you know what happened? Paulita will explain it to you, it's fifteen minutes the ones I have to talk but we've already been talking for ten, look
I see, I see.
This is the song, I'm telling Paula, that kills me
It's about,
this CD is the one that Kido gave me, the Ayllapu, hey
Oh, tell me, tell me Juanito, I'll listen to you.
Look, I found a man, he came from Santiago, a physiotherapist, so, this man, the physiotherapist.
I see. I see.
So, this man, he was going to go to Chile, so I said, I'm going to buy some postcards
I see.
and send them wit this man, I'm going to send them with him instead of through the mail and you know what? This man, he delayed the trip, delayed it and kept on delaying it and then, he left the day before yesterday and he was mad, this lazy man, he left and he didn't take the postcards with him.
He didn't send anything.
Nothing, he's such a lazy bastard.
Those things only happen to you Juanito.
Chilean. Hey, how have you been, Negrura.
Tell me, tell me. Well Juanio, that's fine, fine. There are lots of news, I'll try to tell them to you in five minutes.
Okay, speed up.
Look, oh Kiko, right now, is in Lima.
I see.
We might go back to Peru.
Okay.
Going like, eh, Leader of, of, of Peru, understand?
Sure, that issue which that kid rejected that time, well he
Okay, and he, now resigned.
Ah.
And that's vacant, and Kiko is running, and someone else, but, Kiko tells me that he has great probabilities.
Wow, okay.
So, it's not a concrete thing, Juan, ah?
Okay.
but there are possibilities that he wins.
Okay, that's good.
So Kiko it's so happy, imagine, the tremendous position they are giving him, in a short time.
No,well, if he goes to Peru, he'll take me to Peru, so.
Ah?
Tell him to take me to Peru.
With the honeys.
Sure, to take me to Peru like,  of Tatiana.
Of Tatiana. No, Tatiana is there, well listen, she doesn't move.
Okay
And how have you been, Juanita, are you working, what are you doing.
No, see, no. I have job possibilities, in a job I had before --
Hmm
Eh, they are going to call me, they said they were going to call me last week, but didn't arrive the -- who knows, parts that were missing to begin the work, so possibly the call me this week at the moment that work arrives, they call me, but if not I have to --
Yeah
begin to send resume here, there is work at the newspaper, and there are possibilities there -- but for the moment we are, yeah?
Listen, do you know who, do you know who asks for you a lot and says that you are ungrateful, Domingo.
yeah. Listen, but he, looks --
Write to him, Juan.
But that is the only reason, if I have postcards to send to all, but that is the only reason.
Send it, it does not matter.
Today I am going to see, now, I am going to send them this weekend. I am going to send them. Ah?
Hmm. and that, or call, because maybe has some work for you, I don´t know, well Juanito.
Hasn´t called you, for a work issue?
No, no, with Kiko,I was opening an account for him.
Yeah, but has not called me for a work issue.
No, no, has not say anything, but it is that you don't loose your contact.
No, I know, I know.
Hmm. And you, how are you, how was the family.
Ah, everything going the same, all without any problem and all --
Working the same.
I told Paulita, we went to drop Ximenita at University, last week, on Sunday.
Aye, imagine, she must be happy --
She stayed there, it's far, far from here, about three hours from here.  But she's happy.  The University is really pretty, it's really big.
I imagine, well, in the end it's the family yoke.
No.
Yes, well.  From the Mexican songs, --
There, there's she's sleeping with a stinking black girl, she says, why, why can't I share the room with someone else.
another girl.
Hey, I took a photo --
Yeah, and?
and there was a really pretty photo of Rosita and Sena, I took some nice photos, I developed them.
Hey, you know who asks about you like crazy, is Rocio.
Ah, this stupid, tell her that Constanza --
She said, mom, I want to go and see Constanza, every day she brings me
And the pools are open all year long, you can go and swim and everything is outlined, everything, the pools are perfect, the roads, everything
they are no small roads, they call them, they have, it's beautiful, everything is green. There's Coca-Cola everywhere. I went to the Coca-Cola Museum.
Oh, that's interesting. What did you see there, what do they have there? Lots of Coca-Colas?
skin, I drank Guarana, I drank Guarana, I drank Fanta, I drank a lot of things and I saw
In bottles, they surely have lots of different types of
everything. Everything, everything.
bottles, what, what, what does the Museum have? Since the Coca-Cola first started?
Since Coca-Cola first started, it's three floors, it's huge and they have everything, specially -
Three floors, what's in there? Besides bottles that is.
Yes, they show the commercials -
The different types of bottles, they haven't vary a lot, I think, since it came out
So, so, oh yes, yes, they've varied
They have?
yes, I have, this, I saw one commercial, I don't know if you remember it, it was years ago taped in Lima, in Machu Pichu.
Oh yes, yes.
That's it. I saw that commercial.
And this one is there, that's really good, oh
Yes.
Really good, that's nice, oh, it's a Coca-Cola commercial and it shows Machu Pichu, it's
Mmm.
it has so much importance, right? historically for everybody, right?
Mm.
only for us who feel so proud of them -- but, for the rest, I think that it's important --
Yes. There were, were commercials, yes --
No, a testimony like that!
from everywhere, there was, was a commercial from Rio in, during the carnival, there was a commercial, a bunch, a bunch, is --
Ah.
And this, --
You were remembering, I imagine, in the one of Rio, also --
Yes and, there, I spent a lot of time in the university, I think that I want to study Law, ah?
You liked the university.
I think that I want to study Law.
You are going to, you liked it?
Yes.
Really? But, well, I don't know much about law studies over there, right? I know what
Mm.
from Luis I know, I know how it is here, but over there I think that the system is very different, right? you have to study the cases --
Are cases --
yes, that each case feels jurisprudence, right?
Mm. Exactly, that's what they are doing now.
I don´t know if. Do you like that system?
Yes. Yes.
You should like that system, so, are you ready to make the effort, because I think it is like Medicine, you will have to earn an income again, ah.
I met, I met a guy. Yes, that is true, I met a Belgian guy that also, get into that university --
Yeah.
and, also, he is going to take International Law, and he wants to practice it in Belgium. So, that is possible. And I was talking to people. And I have liked it because I have been there, there are things I read and the cases and  reasoned about them --
and there, Mark, told me that, that he had not thought about it --
Ah, well, I
because , is that I took a course --
I think that. Yes?
I took a course at the university, Do you remember I told you?
Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Yes.
the one with the teacher, the teacher who told me that if sometime I would like to apply to law school, he could make me a very good recommendation letter, Do you remember it?
Hmm. Yeah.
well, that class is a base, is a base for all that stuff then, it was very helpful to that, I knew more than many of them, because as all were just beginning --
Of course.
they know nothing, they have never taken, those who never took a law class, in their lives, they had nothing. they had not idea, in this moment, because they had just begun it --
No, well. of course
The next week I will be passed by them.
You will be there. It is logical, They have overcome you. Yeah, but interesting. I, I am glad because you were a little undecided, right? looking for -- which specialize right?, then it looks fine to me that you have found something you like, like that? --
Mmm.
and it's I believe that Law is a beautiful career. It's very important, I'm more and more convinced, when I talk to Luis, that you are so alike him.
but in a woman, when he complains about, about your confrontations, I always tell him, you shouldn't do that because you are exactly like her.
she's you but in a woman, and if you are studying Law, that's it. Luis will be really happy.
Mmm.
But you have to study hard, you have to try harder, I know that you already do and I'm glad because of that. We feel so, so happy and proud of your achievements.
and the strength that you put into all the things you do, no? You really work hard and that makes us very happy, but, I do think that with such an important career, you  must really be committed to it, no?
Mmm. Yes, well, I don't know.
How is it
yes, it's like
what you are now doing in Dijon, how is it, is that good for you or
I'm a bit against it-
In, about that.
A bit
A bit against it, I'm worried because I think that Rossana abandoned this interchange so that she could have better options, more advantages, no? To Medicine
Mmm. Against it, because I could now begin to study
I see.
but, I won't be able to for a whole year, so, I'm going to have to, I have to take a test.
When are you taking it?
I have to take a test, probably around September or October of next year, I mean, I'd have to
Being in Dijon?
Ah, next year. Next year.
Ah, okay. I mean as soon as you get back, you only have a few months.
Yes,yes. Yes.
Two months, three months
It's enough, if I do study the whole summer--
It's enough. Okay. What you could do, maybe, I think, and about that who knows, can help you is for him to send you information, send you
eh documents, send you offprints, or recommend books to read, because I think that you will have time in the university like to, ah?
You know, what Mike did the day he took the exam from there, he go out
probably that he danced on top of everything, how fantastic!
No, he burned them. He got out and burned them. He made a bonfire and burned them all, he said, I'm not going to see them again.
Well, but there must be someone with less impulse who has saved something, tell him to collect. ah? There must be someone, but suggest to him, that, tell him that someone that has less fits of madness, should have saved their documentation
and it could be useful, because it would guide you, right? so that you there
Mm. It's, it's logic more than anything
Read, Read, read, and then. It's okay, but the logic has some guidance there's, well
What I have to do, what I have to do is take a course in the summer
Okay.
Logic is one of the courses that prepare you for this exam.
Okay. Well that you can do. Yes, yes I think you can do it.
Who knows, in summer
I see, it's going to be interesting, your dad is going to love it. Tell me, were you able to talk to your dad, or  is he just too busy? Was he very busy?
Mmm, just a bit, briefly. He called late in the evening and I was falling asleep, so we didn't speak long, he called late and when he called
I see, sure.
it was pretty late, I had just.
Sure, and did you agree on him calling again?
Surprise, oh. Had I known, had I known
Yes, I imagined that, imagine that.
Had I known that I was leaving, that I was going down instead of up
Sure, but you still wouldn't have been able to talk through the phone, it would have been a fraud to you because he is too busy
but I believe that he has, I'm sure he'll call you tomorrow, if you leave around six, right?
Yes, he told me he was going to call, he told me that.
Yes, because he was like, I'll take advantage of it, I want to talk to you more and and well, he'd say goodbye, he wanted to do the right thing, he told me that he caught a plane and was going to give him a kiss in the airport.
but he then realized he couldn't because the time was short and because he has to come back immediately.
Mmm.
so, it was a big jump and possibly, I don't know, he hasn't told you that he'll do it, he didn't right?
No, well, no.
he'll call you, I'm sure he'll have to work until the last minute and then he'll have time to have a good chat with you.
Yes, he said he'd call tomorrow.
No, yes, sure. You can you can keep some nice memories, to save them in small boxes, little by little, little by little and then the time will be shorter. No, specially that, no? And to think, look inside you and find everybody there, in your heart.
No? It's the most important thing I believe, my daughter, tell me Rossanita, how was your test?
Eh, she says she doesn´t know.
Well, she never knows, also she is so modest, Rossanita, what --
Hmm.
I remember a lot that time she was so frustrated because she had not done very well in an exam, and she was eighteen -- then, you are like this, I am used to it. But she is already more relaxed, I imagine it, she is more quiet, because already --
Yes, yes, but now. She is working right now, so what ---
Ah, she begum again.
Yeah. She begun yesterday.
Of course, She begun yesterday. Yeah. Now she is with you or, did she told you she was going to be on call --
I am going to, no, I do, yes, she is going to be on call, I will see her tomorrow.

Money, money!
Listen, Do you think those bastards present here? They don't make even one presentation here. Not one.
Yes, yes, it is said that since two months ago they don't make one.
Two months ago, Raul, since you left, my dear, they have never made a presentation
Ah, yes, Oh, nanny, I am dying for being with you.
how funny, that --
Nanny, I did not wanted to go, I was not thinking to go because the brothers of Abel called me --
No, yes.
and I was not thinking of going, and I told them I am not going,are you crazy, no, I am not going  to go and damn, I did not thought of going, ah? and later, so --
But why not, my love.

Why not, my love, you can't stay home.
Oh yes, I miss you so much Nany, I don't know
My love, you know what, you are going to get sick.
Well, then, the thing is that I caught, and well I was all quiet and Chino came here and he told me, he called me and he said, hey, and he called me the day before, no, the same day
and and he said, did you know that they were playing today and I knew that they had played about a month ago, so. Oh, yes, I did know so I started to read the note and, oh yes, it's here in the note, it includes the time and hour; lets go, lets go, lets go.
No, I'm not going, oh, oh, and he was pretty insisting, he kept going and going, oh?
Raul, I'm just going to say one thing to you, your friends are really pushy, right?
Hey, hey, that's not right.
Look, listen to me, to go to a concert in Ocaña I'd need to talk to go to a party  like that because, one time, he convinced you to go out with a girl, Juan Carlos did, do you remember?
Hey, hey, Claudia, baby, hey baby-
Yes, he did, Raul, you were telling him, no, no, no, but you go out on a date with a girl and he took another girl
No, I'm sorry, she wasn't a date, we weren't dating, you see? That's not right.
No, yes, she was your date, my love, she was, she was a date.
Oh, no! Which date? I don't know which date are you talking about.
You go out together, date. You go out together, both of you.
Oh, but which one, it wasn't a date, I had no date and Carlos didn't have one either, that's not correct.
Yes, hey.
Oh?
Four, four of you went out, tell me how that's not a date?
But, lets see, tell me who was my partner,because I still  don´t know  who was my partner.
Do you know what was her name?
We were not in couples, Nano, we were not --
Do you want me to tell you her name?
How, No, don´t tell me, because I don´t remember and you do remember.
Fabiola. Fabiola.
Oh, yeah. You remember me so I won´t forget it, right? I don´t know her name.
Yesm that, it is true that stays present, darling, yeah?
Oh,  cute Nanito, my baby.
Imagine, that, that, Bibi comes and tell me, yeah Claudia lets go, lets go, lets go, and Kiko, behind.
You have not paid attention You have not? No?
I go to women meetings, I go, to women meetings.
No, so, you have gone to parties.
Not to parties, Raul.
Yes you have gone.
I have gone to a reunion, gone to a reunion where there were men, there were men inside there and they had nothing to do with me.
Yes? That is worse, it is worse meetings with men, it is worse meetings with men, listen.
But I didn´t know, well see, I didn´t know. I thought --
oh no, Claudia, that asshole wasn´t there, eh --
Which asshole?. Which asshole? No, honey, no my little honey, you, Is Fabiola calling?
No one's calling baby -- Sure.  No one's called me, Nano.
yeah, same with this, same, Raul, ah?  Don't ask me why each time someone calls me, I'll hang up on you.
No, tell me, is someone calling you?  Is it ringing?
No, mom, I say, dad, no sweetie, no.
Ah?  What?  Ah, yeah.
No one, honey, I swear, no one, honey.
No one's calling you, baby?  Swear to me!
Sweetheart, I swear?  Huh?  I swear, sweet baby.
Hmm.  Aye, my god, I really miss you like crazy, Nanito.
Me too, my love.  Listen, my love, was this Raul Romero, was here there?  Did he sing?
Ah?  Yes, yes.
Terrace!
And I, and I, in the, with the girl from costal, I say, because he went out, no, but listen, listen to me, hello.
Hey.  What, hello.
I was jumping with the Chinese guy, I was jumping and saying and the girl from Costal asked, ah, Lucho came out, to tell him, to say, ah, well, and here they're going to present the Whatevers, so he got, ah--
and the one from the coastal said, ah, this is Raul Romero, this is Raul Romero, and the other said, no, this isn't Mr. Romero, Mr. Romero isn't like this, this isn't Raul Romero.
Liar, because they told me that he was really ugly, and she says, ] yes, he's ugly, but this is horrible.  She was defending an arril.
.
And I, aye, since they told me he was ugly, I thought that it was the other, ] not that, defending the other and I kept jumping.

It's very amusing, ah?
Yes, no, Chino has told me.

Yes, of course.
What have you dreamed of?
No, not lately.

Yes, I'll join back, yes, I am om leave there, a five leave but a leave after all, so, at least --
Oh
In January I will spend some days resting at home, and then I'll go back to the University
Oh, let me tell you, then, that here we have had the competition for civil law specialized judges
Oh, and how did it go
Well, I passed all my, fine, fine, and by the end of the month there will be the lists of the ones that have been appointed judges, right?
Oh, really? wow! Congratulations!
Yes, and it looks like I have, I think I have a lot of possibilities, right? because there are --
Oh, mmm, I wish so. Here, everybody I tell I have two sisters that are, one a doctor and the other a judge, they tell me, what? judge? no, judge!
Judge woman. Here in the United States judges are very, very, very appreciated
Oh, well, and fr the responsibility they hold, also, --
Mmm
it is a really difficult charge, isn't it? it involves a great responsibility
Mm. So, nobody --
And so, well, now the contest is in the hands of a minor court who are -- Catholic people --
Mmm. Mmm
specially all those who were, right? who were in the faculty of the Catholic of Lima --
And, and, aha
and they are, they are supposed to be very, mm, non political, very impartial, who get no recommendations from nobody, and they --
Aha Mmm
and right now, I mean, you give another exam and they are crossing information through their people, who have important studies
Mmm
that say, that say what person must be appointed for judge, or must not, and why not --
Mmm. Mmm.
So, through those studies, these persons, well at least since now -- for the references I have been given, for this important reports is that I have been put into the list
Oh, have you?
As the right person, yes
Oh, wow! Great! So you have been recommended, you have been --
I hope so, well, it will be so, obviously
Listen, don't be, no, no of recommendation of -- of card, if not of --
instead they are, eh, references, references no? of the person.
Eh, they have given a good reference for you, Ah, let's hope!
Yes. Well yeah, ah, ah --.
And that, that, is that's a charge, it's appointed, no? you're in the judicial system.
Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely because -- Now, it's good for me, because I have several years of service int eh Judiciary Power, no?
That, and all that counts for your time of service.
Sure, and not there are many opportunities because they are, there are in total, there are like a hundred vacancies.
A lot. Mmm, mmm, let's hope, let's hope.
Between labor judges, civil, criminal, no?
When would you get the news.
At the end of the month.
Ah, the end of this month, Uh.
The end of this month because I passed the test in August.
Mmm, listen, wow, and if it comes out your, your .
Listen, listen you, you sent it or not.
I already sent it, sure, I sent it in June. In October the results will come out. The, ah, have vi- they only tell the ones that. Mmm.
But they will wait, well, think about the licenses.
They only tell the ones that have passed, because there are --
Ah did I tell you that Hugo is in the United States.
Yeah, well, that's what i wanted, ¿where is it?
Uh, well, when he/she called, he/she was in Miami, and from there, he/she was going to New York, California, he/she said, and Houston
¿Yeah?
So it's all a period of about, from here, ¿do you have Mario's list?
Yeah, i think it must be, it must be the same than
Or Mario's mom
yes, i must have it
So, you take, from here, a week and a half, call Mario's mom
Mario Hernández, wait
And the, Mario Fernández phone
Oh, suddenly, ugh, ¿what's his name, Mario?, suddenly i don't have it, ¿do you have it there?
Mario Fernández
And, because i, yes, yes, i
Hey, and, ¿what's your phone?
Oh, write it down
Let's see, because the other day Hugo called and i couldn't give him your phone
Uh huh, Write it down, write, this is it, ¿do you have it ready?
Yes, I've got it
Four, zero, five
four, zero, five
Seven, four, four
Seven, four, four
One, two, nine, nine.
One, nine, that's all. right?
Yes, eh, yes, ah, and you also have to press the number to enter the United States which is one, right?
Zero, one, but since he's in the United State, what is he going to press it for, already.
Aha, Sure.
Here your code, only, okay.
Yes, but you don't have the phone there of, I, maybe I had it, I'll look for it in that letter, Ah, it was Mario Fernandez.
There's no-yes, do you have it?
It doesn't say anything. Yes, seven one thirteen, six nine one, three, three. Zulema says here.
That's his mom, I think. Zulema, is the mom. Then you call - You tell her you are the brother-in-law of Hugo
Mm.
of Janet, and then tell her to give you Mario's phone number, that you want to talk with -- with Hugo, because you can already call him in a week
Mm. Okay. And what's Hugo doing here.
You know that, according to him he wants, he's gone to forget his sorrows
Mm. Okay.
Ah, then he wants to find, well, what he does in life.
Mm. Well, that, maybe he stays here.
He wants to forget, that's why he says, he wants to be three months and return.
Ah, Well, he could do it, if he stays with Mario, if he stays with Mario, until
No but, that which, he wanted to stay in Miami just, for the language issue.
Mm.
That they had told him that studying six months he could renew his attorney degree, right?
Six months?
That's what they've told him. He says he spoke to some attorneys
No. Hard.
in Miami, and they've told him that studying six more months, or a year, I think, maybe they can give him the degree.
Ah, it must be really hard. I don't know how it is, but I think that the system in the United States and in Peru are different, right?
But they have told him and he's had a -- He had an appointment over there with the attorneys in Miami -- and they had told him that.
Perhaps, I don't know much, but, here the, the, oh, the
I think that in each state is different, so, right?
Yes, generally all that issue of law I think,
No, they had also told me, for example to be -- An attorney specialized in defending traffic cases, it's six months, a defender of
regarding criminal crimes, it's a little more, a year or two years. Depends on the specialty you want to do.
Yes, Here the, here that of law is different, how do you call it, to law in Peru.
Okay.
For example, me being an engineer, to study Law, one has to first study any career.
Okay.
For example -- I could right now, finishing, having finished my engineer career, could study law. I can't start law from the beginning. Eh, here they study like that, they study a career, in other words, psychology, eh
But Is that a requisite?
Yes, it is like that, the schools --
Is it a requisite?
Yes,you have to go through a career first and then get in the law school.
Ah yes, right?
Yes, ah, and, then, for example, If I am studying engineering  I can study law, but I cannot study law at first.
Hmm.
Everything is like that - it is like Medicine that lasts years, right? it is a career that lasts years.
Yeah.
So, and even, I think that here the judges are constitutional, I think so, then the structure, the law form is different. here a judge can change the constitution - can change a law -
in Peru, only the Congress can change it. But here a judge, in the moment of giving the sentence, can, if he considers the law --
is, is harmful, he can go against the law, and his, his words have the force of the law, ah according with what I have heard --
Yeah.
is that, the law and medicine degrees here are the most -- people involved in that are the most suspicious, because there is the biggest amount of money.
Of course. Listen and --
Ah, but, if you have been told in Miami, maybe, I don´t know --
Yes.
Well.
So, listen, and what was I about to tell you, so, Have you got in contact with Adela?
With Adela long time ago I haven´t, I don´t communicate with her. Time ago she called me --
With Rosa Maria?
with Rosa Maria either, the last time that we spoke, that we spoke like two hours --
You know that Marianela, Marianela has gone to the United States, did you know?
Marianela, yes. Yes I know that she was going to Arizona -- I don't know if --
Yes, she has already, she left already, because she called here.
Yeah, and, ma, ma, Rosa Maria, did she call you?
No, Marianela called from Canada, that Juan stayed with a Peruvian family --
Mmm. Yes, that's what Rosa Maria told me, and she told me that --
and that, and that she was going, she was going to Arizona.
Mmm. And that Rosa Maria also wanted to go to Arizona.
Ah, she also wanted to live in Arizona.
Mmm. But it's so hot there --
It's ugly in Arizona, well no?
Mmm?
Have you gone to visit Adela in Arizona?
Yes, already a --
How is Arizona.
It's nice, it has a, the houses have a Spanish style, but it's so hot, a --
Terrible.
It's an oven. When here it was cold, it was hot there, so you can imagine, that summer is much more, stronger. It's super duper hot, uff
Sure, you should go there a couple of times. The problem is that you may have gone there for many years
No doubt about it, no doubt about it. I myself felt like going, but well, I was moved away from here. And you know, for the same situation, right? Now, the other question is that I did buy the lot, listen
Oh, you bought it after all
Yes, I did buy it
Mmm. You finally decided
Yes, I hardly, I was hardly able to make the guy aware, listen. And I have bought the lot, now I'm going to fence it in completely, right? I wonder if I should do it with bricks or adobe
Mmm. I don't know, I think adobe is fine
Eh, it costs six hundred bolivars the thousand
with adobe?
Yes
And with --
and with bricks it costs two hundred seven bolivars the thousand
But how many bricks are one adobe?
Mmm, I guess that, that, about six, right?
But besides, how much is the laying, that we should know
Doc- well, the laying costs --
Because, making a brick wall must be more expensive, right?
No doubt about it, right? No doubt about it, but the other is much cheaper, but anyway I would have to do -- the, the, some parts, which are related to the wall foundations, right?
Mmm. Sure. Because otherwise it will fall off real soon
Obviuously. That's how it is, man
Well, that is enough
And there tell me something
here we are OK in the Americas
are you doing the course?
yes, yes, Its been more than a week since I started and I have a lot of things to do, and I don´t have enough time.
And well, do you think everything is working fine?
oh, I don´t know if you received my letter but it is just like I told you...
yes, so nobody tells you what to do nobody says anything.
yes, the thing is that no one would do it right?
I know. well, in fact, I am doing a lot of things so that way I am not going to have so much to do.
Mmm.
so then, I have no choise but to do it
of course.
that is the idea.
Obviosly. It is about the environment
Oh, you know that the environment in the USA is not very good.  right?
Mmm. Well, Monica is taking the first provisions to rent a house.
yes, I talked to her, If you rent it before it would be better because that way everything would be ready...
yes, yes, we are always going to see what is more convenient in all ways.
okay
Oh, on the other hand, they'll install the door tomorrow, the new door, right?
Aha.
They've already prepared the cement and all the other things, right?
Yes, yes, yes. Fine-
And then, some people, some people want for the school year to be shortened, right?
Oh, yes.
because of all the social issues that we are going through, really, you can't, one can't work here, hey.
I've seen that there are lots of problems because the coca producers are also
Well, everybody is in strike and so one can't work.
Mmm.
People, the ones that want to work are being screwed, no?
I see. Fine.
And they are on strike, no, no, no, no, no, because they don't get what they want, they go on strike and we can't go on like this, hey.
It's because the government wants to be with God and the Devil at the same time and that is not possible.
Yes, and it's so hard because, the others want to block the government and put rocks on its path, no?
Mmm. The problem is that even if the have the majority in the congress they don't do anything.
Well, you know that  these people are special, so?
Mmm. That's right, we'll see.
The, is the law eight hundred and three going to be amended?
Again?
Yes, there is it seems that the government is already on the eve of sending it, I imagine, to the congress right?
And there's some rough draft or something like that, or no.
For, what?
Is there some rough draft or something, to?
I've heard something, right? but we don't, it's the fundamental novelty that we have, for example, listen, is that, in a very special way, they have informed me that the authorities have indicated to the factory
that they can't do the double invoicing anymore.
Well, but how do they know that there's double invoicing.
They know, they know extensively.
Ah, well, ah, the double invoicing, I was not
Yes, it's true. Sure, the two tickets, so.
I was forgetting.
that and as far as I have already an absolutely real issue, the order has gone out today. Then, this, up to a certain extent, will continue quite - I won't say beneficial, but it will put a limit already, right?
At least put a limit to the abuse of those, right?
Apparently, it's like that. There we will see in what way all those things come out, listen, Mm?
You know, that when I, when I was in La Paz before coming, eh, I spoke with some people, one of my friends, Joaquin Antezana, was working as a consultant for the IRS
Ah
and he was along with someone else. In reality, the consultants, like most of the times, know very little about what happens in an institution, I mean, they are only hired for a specific issue and that's it, right?
It's like that.
but then I told them what was happening, with this issue, right?
Ah, sure.
and they, really, he and another one, were amazed of how it worked, and well, they said they were going to poke around
Yes, but it's to amaze anyone, right?
Mm. They said they were going to poke around about the issue. Perhaps they've poked around some, right?
Yes, I imagine it's like that, well, they have to fix this, it can't continue, right?
Mm. What would be good, but of what, I don't know, is that you look for another, another business alternative, right? I don't know some, not necessarily the matter of the beer.
Sure.
Something, something even, like see, I don't know, that the thing of the canaries, you were already seeing, something of, there was a store that wanted to sell or something like that.
something, especially in something that you can have some control, because being subjected here to the employees as well as the conditions is quite annoying. right?
Mm. Undoubtedly yes, a little, right?
I mean, I'm not telling you that you are going to have, I'm not telling you that you're going to have a very big business, but rather relatively small that always gives you the freedom to be able to have a little movement and not be subjected to all those conditions.
That's how it is. Yes, well, you have to see all those issues, to see how we can see them, right?
Because these people of the small
in reality we are just studying- we are getting out of the programs that we've had, right?
Yes, Well, no, what are you going to do.
Sure.
But it would be good that you start thinking about that, in some way. I in any case here, the plan I've made, which I already told you, and if I didn't tell you I'll tell you now, but I think I sent you a letter, I'm doing all my plans to be able to finish at the end of this year
I mean, it's not this one, obviously, but rather the next year, and not of August of ninety six, because anyway, it's time, right?
Sure. yes.
and, I'm making my plans to finish everything in December of this year, of ninety five, I mean
Okay.
you see that time flies and I mean, we are now
I see, that's right.
in the ninth month of the first year, it's amazing!
It is.
But that's a tentative plan, I don't know if I'll do it, I'm going to try hard but we'll see what happens, it's not a long time.
Yes, I think it's necessary because you have to take into account that there are lots of cases, for example, an individual that goes away from a certain environment, he looses relevance
Of a, like, what's the name, a group of universities was formed in nineteen ninety, something like that and they started rendering that service, they constituted a company and they started to render the service, all the private universities are with them now.
Sure, that was my understanding.
So, so, they have to enroll and it seems to me that they haven't done it yet, that's why the computers from outside can't recognize them I think even within Chile, the Portals are not intern, they don't recognize them.
So, I sent, for example, Alvarez, and then you sent me, I sent him a message.
Yesterday.
saying that I had received, yesterday, sure.
I see.
After you sent me the message, that I had gotten your message but that I wasn't able to answer, so that I was asking him to please send an internal message, letting you know. Did you get it?
No.
I sent several, I sent one to Reuna too and I sent one to Rutz, about the Portals, so you might get them today but I sent those and it seems to me they never go online, well, so no
I believe that the administrator, the administrator first sat down and sent a message and it seems that he sent to jota eight three
I see. yes, yes, I called him and sent him a message to the three and he sent it, and then, then
And sure, the administrator sent it
I see, I see, I see, I see.
Because it was, it seems to me, I don't know what happened, it seemed to me he had no glasses, he couldn't see the numbers, he was just pressing the keys and then he fixed it, well
I see. I'm telling you, I got another one too, the one from the administrator, it seems to me but it was just in white, three white lines.
Oh sure.
Sure.
He was doing a test, they don't even know if its right, they have a configuration problem.
I see. I see, I see, I answered and well, the message didn't go through, it was returned because it didn't find the
And I don't know, he said, there's one colleague that works there too and he told me, if I let you in, oh, you can do a, a, what did he say? You can enter to the Portales server and then
I see, sure.
from the inside
I see, and I can connect as you do
Sure.
Sure, but we  doesn't recognize it, that's what I did, the command is a Telnet, it seems
Sure, a Telnet.
Sure, but you can't it doesn't recognize it, it's not registered, your computer. NO, it's not, it doesn't recognize it.
Is it registered in Reuna?
In Reuna, sure! That's what, the Reuna has to update the files and all the files that are there and so, and then the computer has to contact another computer, it starts to look, to look
and then the files most be registered, if they are not, it doesn't connect.
Yes, I was using FreeNet yesterday.
Which FreeNet did you go into?
To, yours, well to the address that you gave me
How?
With a Telnet.
I see.
An Open.
I see.
The first Open.
Ah, so put it in my account, then, put, you know, the, A J, eight, eight, two, whatever, at, FreeNet, FreeNet, Carleton --
At Carleton, FreeNet, dot Carleton, dot C A --
Yeah, he's lulito two --
How many?
Lulito two?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so you put that, that's it, and you send from your account to this guy, eight, eight, three, so --
No, if I changed it, then --
Ah, you changed it?  When, yesterday?
Yes, yesterday, just yesterday, because I realize that this guy sent it wrong.
Ah, yeah, yeah.  So, sure this is what I was going to say.  Because if this guy can - but like I say, your machine isn't accessible from outside, from outside Portales, so
No, I changed it then.
Yeah.  Because you didn't get any messages from outside, no?  Did anyone get messages from outside or not?
Eh, no, well, it seems not, I don't know, I really don't know.
No, no, this can't be.  So there you are.
I'm going to try to communicate with a friend from Chile now, so --
Yeah, see if you can.
and I'll get something from here, then.
Yeah.  Because this would also be the other, if you can communicate with this guy from Chile, and from there in Chile you can get it here, outside.
Ah, sure.
Sure, who is it with, with the Maturana or with the other one.
Sure, but the Maturana, the Maturana has certain accounts that have been given to him by the Jaguer.
Fuck, the bastard, I see.
He has several accounts.
I see, and he uses none, does he?
No, I called yesterday to tell him but he was sleeping because he stayed up studying all night.
Fuck.
So he was sleeping yesterday, well
I see, fuck, I see.
so, there are some accounts that must be emptied, well.
You could use one but, from the school, would you be able to get one into Chile?
I don't know, I tried to do it but I couldn't remember the the server, well, it's Araucaria, dot, dot, sec, I think
Oh, wait, lets see, tutututu, Araucaria, no
Arauraria dot sec dot U C H dot C L
Sure, it seems so
That's it?
It seems so, I don't have it here at hand but wait, I'm looking, tututututu, fuck, wait, let me look in the other notebook.
here it is Araucaria, sec, U Chile, C L.
U Chile?
Yes, U Chile.
Oh, UCH?
No, U Chile.
Let's see, Araucaria --
Sec --
sec --
U Chile --
U Chile --
C L --
C L, there it is well, I'll see if I can now.
Yeah.  Okay, and how are they there at home?
Fine.
Yes, everyone's fine?  Claudia's sleeping?
Yes, everyone's fine.  Huh?

No, Claudia left for school.
Ah, she already left, yikes!  What time does she start?
Yes, well.  At eight.

Yesterday I called him, last night.
Okay. Okay, And you can pass by there by the -- are you working? I think so, ah.
Eh, no, he told me to go to his house
Ah, to the house.
because, he's arranging it and --
Ah, yeah.
he told me that he could go at any time --
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you have to go there to the house, it's really far, it seems like it's up there, near La Reina --
It's on the other side of the world --
It's seems like it's up there near La Reina
Yes, at the end, at the end --
Shoot, what will you do, will you want to go back to work or not.
Eh, no, I'm going to go, I'm going to throw the towel in, I don't know, well, one of these days. I'm going to tell a friend to --
Yeah.
to leave me close to where the cars go, to throw me out --
Yeah.
and leave me close and after I'll return to the mike, yes --
Yeah, because I'm sending you --
the old --- ah?
huh?  Because I'm sending you the check, now I put together two checks, now I'm sending them to you this afternoon --
Yeah.
and in them I was explaining to you about the discs from the agenda and I told you, electronic, from the --
Hmm.
what's it called, it seemed like the first disc is corrupted.
And is there need to clean it?
Eh, no, eh, it must be, there must be in the first disk files with the extension X C or extension T X T --
Yeah, as, text
text of TXT and it seems all are with a dot, how do you call the underscore -- and two other letters, so, some way those files were replaced --
so if you did not have, file, take a look in particular to  disk one if don´t, eh, because I had to install it with disk one, eh, if I didn´t have file XC it means that I will have to send it to you again --
Hmm. Yeah.
Yeah, or if not, take a look, or the fatass could take a look, because I gave the same disks to the guaton, to Jose Pacheco.
And Does he own a computer?
It seems he doesn´t the -- I don´t know if he has one in the pega -- you can tell him to lend them to you to take a look, in case yours are broken, I don´t know, because I donn´t think he has at home
So that, and I also sent another surprise package for you.
Yeah. One camera, he also told me, that would come, told me that buddy --
Ah, the fatass told you, son of a bitch the guaton frog, the guaton.
Yes,
I told that mother fucker that it was a surprise, son of a bitch mother fucker, he screwed it the guaton. Yeah -- Yeah, hopefully you like it, that it works for you --
Yeah.
And to send me some pictures, for that I am sending it to you, maybe the film is still inside it --
Hmm.
Did you took out the film at the end?
Yes, yes, it seems it was taken out --
Bitch, and -- and how was he, it is good or not?

Hey, and there pictures from here Canada,
Yes, I don´t know, the film must be over there somewhere, no, no, I don´t think they were developed yet --
Oh God, yeah.
It is that it is a robbery to develop pictures here --
Ah?

Well, I believed that he was here by eight and twenty, I'm such a mess.
To what?
Hold on a second, lets see, oh, I've made a mess, the flight is number sixty two
yes
the flight number is sixty two
you see
and I thought that he was coming at eight and twenty, wait, let me check
At what time does it get here?
How?
At what time does it get here?

and, is it eight and twenty then?
tomorrow, tell Lucy to call Continental and make sure at what time does it land
okay, okay
oh, is it nine twenty? It's nine twenty, nine twenty in the morning

Done, I've done it now. Mmm
Oh
and after I come, the tenth of October, the tenth of October and the plane leaves at eleven fifteen in the morning
at eleven fifteen, well I think that Angeline already got her ticket for the thirteenth
aha, she already bought it, did she pay for it?
I think so, I was going to try in any case to call her no when ]
call her now so she knows.  What's Angelines doing in Madrid?
on Continental?
yes
yes, at eleven fifteen, no?
hmmm
at eleven fifteen, on the tenth of October
yes, and the flight is sixty three
sixty three well, in any case I'll call her, but if she already got her ticket, well, you'll have to come on different days
well don't worry, tell her if she can change it, to change it, and if not, it's fine. Ok?
Yes, and how's Samuel?

but mom, Robert is driving me to the airport because I had to change the ticket, it turns out that Robert was leaving that same day, before me, so in order for him to be able to drive me to the airport I had to change the ticket, but, the trip is not going to be tiresome
hey, for example, oh, oh, mmm if Angelina bought a ticket too, they will change her ticket too?
yes, I believe so, they can change it without a problem
yes, and we know that for sure, oh?
I changed mine now, how?
are we certain that she bought the ticket?
go and ask her, I think she had to pay it at the last minute but anyway, I have now changed mine, I had already paid for it, I already had a ticket
so, can you pay it at the last minute?
you can with some tickets, you can book it and pay a month later.
oh, if you pay it with Visa
well, even if I pay it with Visa I still have to pay it a month later, I don't know, it depends, if she hasn't paid for it, she should change it and if she already paid for it she should ask them to change it.
fine, fine
to see if you change it

Hey girl, your mom told me that you made the mushrooms with vinegar
No
¿No?, oh

But you buy them like that?
Yes
oh, i thought, uh, i thought that you made them, because that time, well i really didn't look at the jar, ¿right?
aha
I said well maybe well Chucha prepared them, I didn't see if the bottle had a label or not.
yes, well you know how to prepare the chilli in vinegar
no no
ah
no, I don't know then I think they must be prepared the same right?
yes, I once, I don't know how but once I saw how they prepared it
hmm
Ah do you know how to do chiles in vinegar?  huh?  half cooked and you put them in the vinegar
ah yes I think that they put in a bit of bay leaf, no?
but they're raw, don't cook them too much or anything, right?  like, what you'll put in the vinegar, half cooked, can be carrots, chiles, mushrooms
any kind of vegetable
any thing, half cooked and then you only cut them with a combination of vinegar and olive oil
what kind of vinegar?
what kind of vinegar?  let's see, the best is apple
well, ah okay, well, no well I thought that the, that the ones you prepared
so
well this
ah ah and there's another - and the jar that you put them in is really boiled so you don't get any bacteria in there
the vinegar?  Okay, ah the jar, ah okay
a really boiled jar, so you don't get bacteria, and they won't spoil
yes, yes, okay, they're giving me all the instructions
and then, you put them all in the jar, and then you leave them for a few days so
so, hmm, yes
they're stewed, right, and then you eat them
ah okay, well, nothing, well, this is why I talked to you and to say hi.
Fatty, maybe nothing happened, my dear.
No I know, my love, calm down, I am fresh. I miss you a lot, so if I go back, I don´t mind it.
No, my dear, because you want your job and I also want you to be well,
How are you doing, did you called?
No, my love, because today we are ten.
No, at eleven.
Yes, they told me that, not eleven, twelve, because of that, but, but, I cannot call the exact day
At eleven. Well, yes, wait until I tell you tomorrow.
Because of that, my dear, okay, my love.
Wait until I tell you tomorrow, and if not, well we already know and well and you can call and have your interview.
Tell your mom that Constanza was going to call and wanted to talk to her to say thanks for the gift that Gilberto sent to her and all, but that she couldn´t communicate for something, because we accorded it, and I arrived from classes early today --
Hmm.
and I have just arrived, and told me, no, it is impossible, I cannot, that thing doesn´t work, look too see if it works for you, and so good, fat one, yes, it worked to me, fatty --
Ah, then when it finish they will tell us, when the time is over --
I don´t have idea, I don´t know, it is supposed to be fifteen minutes --
Ah, you were dialing at all hours.
but I don't know how much, how much we have, but she told me it was for fifteen minutes.
Ah, what?
Then, she didn´t say it was for fifteen minutes
so, look the clock.
well yes, I am --
Look the watch to be sure.
Well I don´t know what time I called, but well, it is --
But you are looking right now.
yes, and and you did, then my dear, what have you done. Is there a nice weather?
Well,
What have you done.
Of a pray, what, love. Yes, there is good weather, it has not rained. It rained one day, not more.
Ah, good, good.
It rained one day, not more. And, no well, here waiting all the day sitting, in the house.
Don´t, don´t be disappointed, fatty, wait to see, maybe suddenly, the list is not ready, my dear.
No, no, what disappoints me is that there is happening the same thing that with Avianca, that you have to wait and waiting and waiting and waiting and nothing.
No, my dear, but see, it is logical because the old one had twenty tests to, to review, not the --
No, but it is that the psychologist, the psychologist told us on Saturday that she finished the results the same Saturday or the Sunday, so on Sunday, Aerorepublica knew the psychological  results.
Well, and you took note of the telephone --
But, anyway, there is a delay, there is a delay because or if not, why they did not have the list, ready this morning.
and you did not take --
If there is a delay, who knows why, I don´t know.
You did not took note of someone to confirm if that person was called or not.
No. No, no, because I thought only in going to the doctor, because I, there was not need of anything else, besides ah, there directly, right? I memorized the name of one of the secretaries and called --
but she didn´t answer anyway, but I talked to the other one and told me that, what I said to you. Another thing that makes me suspicious,I don´t know if this was candy, see, because when I arrived to the test, I was not in the list.
Yes,
Others were called, they gave them a number to each one, they were all called and I wasn´t, then they added me to the list, then I was one of the lasts that they put in the list.
Or that they, or that they forgot it.
So I don´t know if they made it for a candy, for a candy, like for --
Oh, my dear, do you think so, do you think so --
No, no, not necessarily, I don't know if, listen to me, listen what I am telling, I don´t know if they have done it because well, they were in an obligation with Dr. Trujillo --
and put me in the list, I don´t have any idea, then, lets see, if not, this, in this moment, talk - having been delayed things, to me, the things are cold, but --
My love, do you think that anyone is going to play with a person that spends all that money that goes from the United States to Colombia only to, to --
well, sweetheart, they don´t, yes and not, because they are between the sword and the wall --
but what a people --
like here the relations, as here the relations are well ah -- the contacts are so important and the doctor had --
No.
talked to that guy, and had recommended so much to give a chance to me and to the nephew --
And the, fat one, and the nephew?
well they said yes at last, but knowing that we could be suspended in the process, but of course, it is very easy to take one out from the process, see.
Fat, and the nephew presented with you, my dear.
Yes but I have not idea who he was. We were thirty pilots there and, they were to take twenty but ten were for captains.
Hmm.
There were, there sere even captains from Avianca there asking for a place.
Good, anyway nothing has been lost yet. Wait until tomorrow, okay?
Yes.
Okay, my love.
Yes, so, I am, I am fresh, my love, I don't care, could care less, for one, to not, it's more problem coming, but you know the meaning here.
No, how is that - No, my love, it's not more problem coming, that's the least of our concern, dear, the going, the important thing is that you fly, my love.
Well,
Okay?
No, if I don't fly here, I fly there, love, but well sure, the chance here is bigger right? No, not everything is lost yet, let's see what happens.
Good, do what you can, dear, do what you can so it happens, my love, okay?
Sure, dear. No, tomorrow I will wear my best dress and I am leaving to go there.
Okay. Then we'll look, then the rest will be fixed, dear, that, that is the least of our concerns.
And how have you been.
I am very sad, my love.
Why you miss me a lot?
Oh, dear, I don't make, look you'll
I need you so much, for me too, my love.
All day long thinking about you, dear, I don't talk, in Suipco they are terrified with me that I was like that terrifying, I don't speak with anyone, I don't direct
Oh, how nice then, talking, because
Oh? No, no, no. Before I would talk a bit, do you understand?
Yes.
Let it go, what's up, and what else, but no more, now, honey, something's asking me something and i'm, umm, umm, ¿you know what i mean?, nothing, nothing, I'm not talking to anyone
And, ¿did you teach today?
Yeah, but I'm done already, i'm done, I'll call the
You're done with the group
Yes, i have one Wednesdays and fridays
Oh, well, you have classes
So there's no problem
¿Did you finish with just one group and now you have a new group or what are those classes about?
It's a group that came with someone else and now they gave it to me
Oh, well
Because they rotate them, it also depends on which day the professor has free, or something. Uh, well, honey, i think I'll
Oh, right, but did you say, you said no to teaching in a college, ¿right?
Yes, i said, i said that with Sally, because Carolyn was in Chicago then, all week, but I'll call her home, to talk to her, it's better
It's ok, well, and, wel,l the
Okay, fatty, hon, hone, honey, it's for, no, fatty
Uh huh
don't you bring anything, fatty, ¿okay?
¿What do you mean no, if...?
No, honey, don't bring stuff or anything, ¿okay?, what I'm
Oh, yeah, because, yeah, the thing with the house happened like that, so yeah, the money for the house, so we have to keep saving
No, none.  There, there, there they are waiting with the Dochester, fatty.
Yes, they're waiting for us, but how will it happen, to pay for the Dochester if we don't have a thousand dollars?
Well, this won't happen, this won't happen because you're going to take this test tomorrow, you'll see.  Honey --
yes, hey, and this is the thing, I didn't study today, I was worried about the call and I didn't study, but in reality, I think that I know everything, it's stuck in there, I know everything about aerodynamics, I have it in my head, ah, hmm
Ah, you know this, sweetie.
I have meteorology more or less, so I feel good for the exam.
Okay.  Did you hear about the plane in?
Yes.  In the end, they found out what happened
The seven thirty seven?
What happened?
It didn't last the turb- They say that it turned over.
Ah, son of a, sure --
They say, they say, and since --
They say.  This, this is the --
and since it was such a short time before they were going to land --
Aha.
so they couldn't, the guy, the pilot, couldn't do anything at all, they say, but there's nothing concrete.
But they already have what the pilots said --
Sure, and they took, and they took when the pilots said to the control tower that something's happening, that there's a failure and the guy swears and says and that's where it stayed --
Ah, this is the last thing they always say, how crazy.
Well, my love, I leave you, fat, okay?
Well. Take care a lot, are you locked?
Yes, I am locked and I keep the two doors of the closet opened.
Well, and Buchito?
Buchito is at my side, cute child. I miss you a lot,
Tico and Pecas, and Tico an Pecas clean?
They are fine, but they eat a lot, my life.
Don´t give them too much, once a day.
Eat a lot, I don´t know what to do. Yes, I am giving them once a day, but that Pecas --
But the water is clean --
Yes, it is clean.
If it gets dirty, it is not that, you take out with a cup half of it or whatever, and add a little bit of fresh water.
Yes, that does not matter. Well, my love, lot of luck, hear it? have, have, have faith in that, of --
Well, mochita. Is the time over?
Yes, I think so. have faith in that it is going to happen, because you are going to have it, my dear. Yes anything, call me.
Well, sweetheart, well, love. Well. Ah --
Okay? And, and, and, if don´t, don´t bring anything, if you have money left over --
No, I bring, bring, bring a pair of, I am going to see if I find the video of Carlos Vives, and I saw a book of --
have you spent,have you spent?
I saw the book, in the airport I saw the book of Mafalda, complete, it says --
Yeah.
everything Mafalda, and it only cost like five thousand pesos or something like that --
Well, did you spend a lot of money, my child?
No, nothing, I haven't spent --
Good, if you haven't spent, good --
Nothing, my love, if there hadn't been, fifteen thousand pesos, fifteen thousand pesos in psychology, that's all.
Well, yes, no, if for any reason you come --
Yes, yes.
you have to come, no?  If nothing happens for you, do me a favor, no?  Leave one hundred --
yes.
I, from the fright that Michel had called me at eight, I said, it's true, I told him, well, my son, I come with a huge magnifying glass to see the mess
And bad!, well, right?
and this, like a madhouse, because I have all the recycling newspaper here inside, ah!
I can imagine.
ah, my child, then I well, since I'm all polite and I'm not a liar, told him, well yes, look that I have my apartment a mess, a little, because of the newspaper, that I'm recycling, mm,  mention the newspaper.
It means that the people
The mother urged me, well. All the generation and would jump and
well, as long as that doesn't get to that country and all those things don't go, ah, how funny!
Ah, no. My brother is going to kill me from a heart attack.
Ah, yes. See
But the great beyond pulled his legs
Angela, come, that I wanted to ask you something.
What, what.
You that know all those things of law and all those things
Correct.
how are the things of marriages, that I don't understand. That they get married with their personal property separated, that they get married with their personal property joined
Ah.
I don't understand those things. How is that, that I don't understand the type of marriages there are.
Well. It means that if they are done eh, before getting married, through attorneys
Mm, mm
each one a declaration that their personal property is not going to be included in their marital property
The personal property that one has before getting married.
Exactly.
Mm.
Then those that are not included, just as the inheritance is not included, the ones that are testamentary
Yes.
that one of the parents receive or from the uncles
And it's a type of marriage.
only the things included from the date of the wedding on are valid, what has been valued real property.
Yes.
let's say that it cost thirty million at the moment, those thirty are left alone - but from thirty up, each million, that, it's included in the marital property.
Yes.
Then one can make. Is that right now I don't remember. Eh, a statement that you want to have marital property in force but with their, each one with their separate personal property, right?
Okay. And what other type of marriage is there.
If they don't do that, the marital property is normal.
Ah, okay.
Always and when they've inherited, if, if they've inherited from any person and they get married -- those, those properties are not included in the marital property, but rather the generated interest after the marriage.
Yes, ah, well.
No, I mean, not completely.
Yeah, is that, in conclusion, one is that one leaves, and everything is the other´s.
Yes.
and the other thing, is that before you marry, what they call here, ah --
To make an agreement, exactly, exactly.
a premarital thing, in English what happens is that, like the marriage is going to be with laws from there, right?
Yes.
not from here, then I don't know how things are going to be.
Yeah.
but, but Joie told me that his parents, don´t tell anybody I don´t want anyone to know so they cannot say a word about it, as they have their money, right?
No, no, no. Yes.
I don´t know how much, but I think it is a lot, that he stays with his inheritance --
Yeah.
I imagine --
Yes.
because they were talking something to her --
Yeah.
and he told me that we have to talk about the kind of marriage, that he did not understand those things, and I said, no well, I understand less, I told him, I am going to ask because I don't know, then they are going to tell him something when he goes now.
The same that Onassis did with Jacqueline Kennedy. that, that Jacqueline could not inherit complete because they made a premarital agreement. Premarital.
Yes, I don't know what they want.
You have to read before signing something.
Yes, but he must be like a progressive Chinese.
Ah, yes in the
that the other one tells me what he is saying
Yes.
but, I wanted to know eh, beforehand, because I don't care- if that is what they want, to me well, is not that I love it, but I understand them
Yes.
worked all their life, and, and it's their money, right?
Yes.
Then if, if it refers to the inheritance
Yes.
I understand that it's their money and ultimately, they see who they give it to, right?
Yes. yes, but also
but what I didn't know was if there was something else that can harm me in any way. I mean, they are very loving with me, they are very nice with me, but since I don't understand those things
No, what happens is, is what you say, that they want to safeguard their wealth and in case of divorce they don't want you to demand
from the inheritance.
from the inheritance, but
but, of the rest, yes
Yes.
at the moment that we both get married, that goes to me, also.
Exactly, and to him, too.
Ah, well, as I have nothing, to me --
So, what they want is you to take a small portion, not a complete one.
I imagine it. That is what I imagine, because he did not understood and get, mad.
Yeah.
Ang get mad, and he yelled and said things on the phone, and hung up furious and told me that --
But what happens is that, they have made a will, because you always do that when, a will has been made --
Yes, yes, they have -- it is that imagine, that people is very wealthy.
Yes.
and I imagine, of course, as they do not know me, they don´t know my family -- I imagine,right? that they say that, they --
yeah, Aha. They could think you are a fortune hunter --
no, I don´t think so much, but I imagine that, they want to take care of their health --
Yes.
but since I, I don´t want Alfonso to know this, I don´t want that --
No, no, no. no. no.
nothing, because this is a problematic issue.
Oh, Alfonso is an ignorant in relation to laws.
No, and that is, because I know what I am talking about, I said, I am going to ask to Angela, to see what, okay.
It is that. So what that means is that the portion you are going to have in the marital arrangement is going to be less --
Okay.
but the children will not lose their heritage.
Yes.  No well, I see, because he'll explain it to me when he returns, no? --
Yes, yes.
from his trip.  He'll explain to me what they said to him, but I want to know on my side, what this is.
So, these, they're prevented regarding a divorce --
Yes.
since marriages today don't las--
Ah, like, as long as you're not divorced, everything's good.
Everything's good.
Ah.
This is for the future of a gold digger who only gets married for money and not for love --
Ah. Well they don't --
And have international lawyers, who know everything --
If I was in their situation, I would have done the same, I imagine, no? --
Well, logically.
because you never know who the other will be, and everything, and no, and money is for no one else, I imagine.
But the laws are there as a mockery, honey.  There isn't Jacqueline Kennedy with all this prenuptual agreement and Tina Onassis got out more than the portion that they had said.
Listen, tell me, and what about the mom of the girl.
Ah, honey, they don't want to turn to me.  I lent her fifteen thousand dollars --
Ah, because they knew that you knew that --
No, no, no.  I didn't tell them anything.
Yes.
I told her to come and I lent her, borrowed, fifteen thousand pesos, and I told her that I was going to test her because, to see if she fulfilled
Mm
because I couldn't continue giving her money
Mm
then, I called her and told her, what's up, and why didn't you appear on Monday
To the girl's mom.
then she said, no that until Thursday that they pay me, I'll go Thursday and pay you
Mm
then she's going to come tomorrow.
Ah, God.
I told her to stay, she said, no, no
And are you going to tell her something?
I would always talk and when I win the lottery, and could tell her, momma walk, I show you a house and, it's for you
Ah, what a sin and the
they are exploiting her for that sin. You understand me, right?
Ah, God. Yes, I imagine.
I tell you that Claudia Lopez, the daughter of Teresa Lopez had, Manuela's sister had a baby.
And Manuelita's sister, ah, yes, she's her niece.
Yes, Manuela's niece.
Ah, she had a boy?
She had a baby by cesarean.
Ah, see, the first.
Yes, the first, because she had already lost three.
Ah, how much of, what?
She had lost three pregnancies.
How come?
Eh, because, it seems she has something in the uterus and they would come out.
And Teresa, how has she been.
Bad, bad, terrible.
Ah, what a sin, poor woman.
That lady is going to be an invalid
Ah, God.
Because of the weight, since she is diabetic
Yes.
the, the change of hips got ruined
when are you going to record soap operas for me
Ah, child
Oh, aren't there those miniseries that seashell presented?
Yes, but what happens is that I live sometimes in the moon
Record me a series so that when I go I can bring it
Okay.
Ah, don't be bad, remember. Ah, that of Rete is what fascinates me, because here the only thing you see, is terrible
Yes, I've remembered but I've been -- really, I'm very sick because Alfonso has me with the hairs standing on end
But that, what good is that, what good is that
Well, okay, I'll tell you that he already gave me permission, because my
For what
To recycle the newspaper
Ah, what
I would tell him, and why do you recycle -- well to eat, my son, because you cut my budget and my dad doesn't increase my salary.
But what, ah, no, my God.
well don't eat. Ah, my child, I'm not the holy spirit, to not eat
The invoice is going to be issued to the university
something like that, right
that's not important
it's not?
no, that's just as you said, because, do you remember that we had made the calculation and it was going to be around one or two hundred colones, right?
yes, yes
so, I think that you were probably thinking about valuable articles
yes, that's right, they have to be for a professor nor for students, right
mmm yes
oh, for a professor or a professional that needs this information for a conference or to prove a point, whatever
yes, yes.
Now, how long do you think it would take for the information to get here to El Salvador?
look, if you are interested in that you can do it through the university and I'd look for a way for them to send them because, you know they don't act quickly, they would send it through regular mail
yes
so, I would, I would try to have them send it to me
it'd take fifteen days
and I could then fax it to you, if you have a fax
yes
Oh Maria Cris-
yes, we have a fax in the university.
Oh, that, yes, yes, let's say it's short, ¿right?
so
yeah, it's about ten pages, yes
yes
Yes, it's very large, Maria Cristina can send it quickly, ¿right?
yes
And so it's
¿And this would add to the cost, right?, uh
In the quick thing, yes, oh, oh, fifteen days
Yes, yes
to, i think that the fifteen days might not be too much trouble as the fact that it might not get here
in fifteen days, it would be which day, ¿daughter?
¿how?
the fifteen days, ¿in which day do you think it might arrive?
¿like which day?, uh, by air mail
yes, yes, for those fifteen days, air mail
yes
Now, at the time, for example, a person, lets say i want an item, ¿right?
Yes, uh huh
so i call you on the phone
mm
and I tell you I need this, right, and I'll give you all the details of what I want
aha
then you can connect with those people in the university and they look for it, right, no, they tell you to go find it, right?
first, the first thing I would do is let's say you need an article, you call me
no, how is the thing, listen
and you tell me
yes and I give you the information
look, here is the information then the next thing I do is look in my catalog in the university and see if it's in
because if it's not there for the process, right?
okay
then I can do it for you, from my computer in, in the office
yes
and it's very simple for me
yes
then I see ah this is not there, then I call you
okay, there it ends
and I tell you it ended, if it is, I write it in that little form that you are going to give me right?
aha
I'm going to make a lot of photocopies of that and I'll send it to
yes
and depending what we agree with them eh whether they send me the article to me so I send it by courier or by fax or send it to you by airmail
yes yes, well we could try the airmail and assume that the information will arrive here in around three weeks that it goes and comes and all and they send it three weeks
well yes, hmm
right? -- now see that talking to the dean, daughter, he told me that instead of the we were going to take another wider
aha
see, it is wider besides the information includes other things the university is going to pay even more money for that and then are going to have more information besides the medical sciences, it is other
how good ah
see how good, to me it looks very good, because of that I want to be very informed of all this, to get the most of all these questions, really
now maybe what I am going to do is, I am going to make an essay with some article, right
aha
and then I will ask you to send it to me to see how much time it takes, now. Eh, purposely daughter, I wanted to tell you about the articles on streptococci
eh those you have there collected did you send them to me?
so you, the abstracts
I don´t know if they were the abstracts or full articles but I remember that Maria Cristina told me she has some and you told me that you have others besides those you brought when you came
no, I had a lot of abstracts
aha, well
eh I Arturo don´t and the, and Mena I don´t know if, she went and found more I don´t remember if she told me, because I sent her by
I sent the abstracts and all to, with Cesar and they arrived then I don´t know it is possible that she had found more
aha because I have not received any, daughter -- fortunately a teacher came
well re-
he has come twice to El Salvador from New Mexico and he brought me
oh, the one I spoke to? yes, with, yes with
yes, what's his name, oh, Ma Cla- Mac Claning
aha Mac Claning aha
Mac Clakling, that Jim Mac Clakling, oh, he told me
this, isn't it Mac Cluffen?
no, Mac Clakling
oh I see
Mac Clakling, it has a weird pronunciation, right?
yes, yes, I was saying it wrong
so, he told me that he had talked to you and that he had also talked to Maria Cristina
oh, oh
so, he brought some articles and he left them here
aha
but he told me that he had talked to you and that you had other articles so, I wanted to ask you if you were able to put them in the mail or not
well, let me ask Mena because, as I said, I don't have any more articles, I had some abstracts
ah I see
but, if I remember correctly, you told me to send those, right?
yes, well, yes
well, I'm just remembering what you said and no, I haven't send them but I can send them, I have them in the computer.
oh well, if Maria Christina has hers send them all, send them by mail
yes, yes, I'll tell her now
send them by regular mail, don't send them through overnight mail, just regular mail
yes, yes, yes, yes
airmail, right?
that's I'll do that, I had forgotten about that and I forgot about the other articles but I'll call
well, so look, when I get one of those things, my daughter, I'm going to try and do a test to see what happens
aha
now it has to be something that is well worth it because in reality, it's expensive, so I have to wait for something that is well worth it.
yes, yes, yes
and I'll try and see how this fits with the system that we are buying in our university too, oh
yes, yes, yes, you've already told me that you don't have to do a minimum of anything if you use one per year, it doesn't matter, no?
because it's not like, it's not like, it's a service, right?
yes well, the university service
yes, it's like a library, the library
library to library
that's the name
and you don't have to and that way we don't have to do any additional paperwork, no
oh yes, I don't know if you need to or not, I'll find out, I wanted to see if you were interested and oh, as I now know that you are I'll find out what we need to do
yes sweetie, perfect, perfect.  Look this call that we're doing is fifteen minutes
aha
does someone else pay it or do you pay it?
no, someone else, it's free for me
ah ok, for the fact of being
this is ] it's someone who's doing a study, studies on conversations in Spanish
yes for the
in reality on conversations with, with other languages and
aha ]
it's well, this is part of, of Spanish, Cesar sent it to me, he sent me a form
aha
and everything and so, I did it and
perfect
it worked out
well eh, it's been really useful because in reality I'm going to try to have a connection at the right moment to see how this works and so when I have a better of idea of how this works
so I can tell you that us in the best case with this service, we'll buy, we'll have the, let's say, some references
aha
but at any rate if one wants the whole article because he the, he has given directives that in order to be useful he has to ask for it, right
yes
so we can use that one, that other service
yes, yes
and that's what he .
And eh and for, and on the other hand I want to tell you really quick, Carlos is already taking his classes and he's taking Chemistry right now
Ah yes?
look he words and goes to classes like from Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays from five to ten at night
good heavens!
can you imagine
and where, and where does he go there
I think he goes to San Jose
aha
or he's going to transfer to San Jose he's going right now to do his, his to
that's good
and on the other hand he stayed without like it's that, Sean left with his girlfriend and Alan went with his girlfriend and he stayed
silly like that he is that he's seeing if he's a bit sad for that
all alone, and who is Sean's girlfriend?
but.
and there, at least now, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, like ten Venezuelans, that I know.
Listen, but you have your friends there, among your fellow countrymen, right?
Yes, yes. And in total, in total, as of two months ago, there were like fifty Venezuelans, here.
Very good, great!
Yes, what happens is that many have already left, others left to another state to study, and --
But all, to study, all, with scholarships.
Yes, all. Well, not all of them have scholarships, some on their own and others, with scholarships.
Ah, okay, but all of them students, anyway.
All students and eager, well --
Always, postgraduate.
Yes, others. There are some postgraduates, there are some doctorates, there are some post-doctorate -- We have a friend who worked in the and he's doing here well, the doctorate.
Mm.
And there are people that just come to learn English and leave.
Ah, okay,
Yes.
Look, and now, in, in what season are we, what are we in?
We are in, in autumn.
In autumn, have the flowers, the leaves started to fall?
Not yet, but, but the cold is already starting a little.
Mm. Sure. You arrived, then, in summer, right?
I came in, I came in March, I came in what they call the spring.
Ah spri- hey, ok, how great, you know!  Supposedly the most beautiful season, no?
Yes, they say that, but, but it was snowing, buddy, ] yes, yes.
It was snowing, in spring time, so, ok.  How can in snow in spring, man?
well, it's like that.  The snow stops in May more or less.
Ah.
Like we had March and --
And I think it's ok, sure, that it's OK and --
Yes.
Look, and so, and right now, what's the average temperature, because the yanks always want to know, no?
Well, right now here, we're like, in the day, full day, we're almost at ninety degrees, it's Fahrenheit, it's like thirty or twenty eight degrees centigrade.
Ah, okay.
And, and in the morning, it gets down to like sixty five degrees Centi- Fahrenheit, which is like fifteen degrees centigrade.
Okay.
But -- Tell me, tell me --
And the, the music, how is it?
Well, I haven't done much with music, because -- There I was playing with a friend who's a professional musician, he, also in Venezuela, he sang professionally --
but he's also an engineer.  So eh came here and he's doing his masters here.  And here he's pretty famous because -- because he's played several times, so --
So, what's his name?
his name is Juan Carlos Salazar.
Mmm.
So, he, he was playing in the University, in public shows the University,
And which instrument does he play?
He plays the guitar.
And sings
oh, he sings. He has a nice voice. He has a very oh- voice
Hey, that's great, oh
Yes so, we were working but we stopped because we both went back to the university, I'm trying to adapt, I have to get good notes and I have to study harder and all of that, you know?
it's taking all of your free time, university.
Yes, sometime ago Monica and I had time to, I don't know, go out and everything, joke around, but now I'm focused on my classes.
Well, that's what you have to do, for what you are saying, to get good grades, right?
Right.
and your doctorate.
Sure.
So yes, so, you told me that the mood there is a bit country, like a small town
Yes, a town, yes, yes, it is  but it's not like, like the towns in Venezuela, this is a city to me
Sure.
this, it feels like a city but imagine that here, the cars, the roads are so wide and so, yes, yes, it's huge. This town has one hundred thousand inhabitants.
I see.
supposedly, right? But, but I believe that there are more, because of the students, no? The university has twenty thousand students.
Sure, no, but then what happens is that the population density, no?
Sure.
but, the services, it's something that there they're really aware of, it's more isolated, they always have complete services -
Everything, everything.  Everything's complete.
Sure.  Look, and Pablo told me that you bought, I saw it via Fax too, that you bought a nylon string -
Ah, yes, yes.
How's it going with this
Hey, good.  It seems really good.
Yes.
Yes, the only thing, I don't know why, those days we were playing, and, well, about two months ago, and the bridge came off -
Hey, the same thing happened to Pablo's one -
Aha.
to Pablo's guitar, to the-
Well-
the bridge came off and he had to send it to Gutierrez to fix -
aha, but at least his bridge broke from the base -
Yes.
where mine broke, it was where you push the strings, that's it, this piece came off, where the microphone goes, well.
ah, but
So, I also, I glued it because I couldn't go, what happened is I bought it in Denver -
But you've asked to go have them change it for you, sure.
Yes, I know.  I bought it in Denver, and it's a little difficult coming from Denver, because Denver is like, forty five minutes from here, you see? --
Sure.
so, so we have a ca- we have a little truck but we can't drive it a log, because, because if it hurts us, well --
Sure.
a little truck that our friend lent us --
Ah yes.  How nice.
Yes, a Ford, a Ford, a Ranger, eighty four.  So the little truck is good, but it's not like we're going to start traveling with it, you see?
Sure.
So the thing was, I could have gone to Denver and gotten, hopefully, someone who would give me the tail, but, I took it, but it was stupid, so I stuck it on and it was perfect.  Anyway
And you can be there or something like that, no?
Yes, well since it sounds good, it didn't lose sound or anything, I left it alone.
Hey, but how strange, right.
Yes, hopefully it's a problem of the
I'll tell you that I'm starting to believe it because it's the second time that this happened.
Yes but hey, the sound is really cool.
Yes ah
When I can, in a while, God willing, I'll see if I can buy a small amplifier.
Ah, because there you're connected to the equipment.  Ah, yeah.
Yes, well, an equipment that, that we have here, that they gave us, because we, we couldn't buy anything, because everything here is really expensive.
Yes, true, it's like dollars.
I mean, for us it's expensive, for the people that live here, no. I mean, here you come and buy a new car in seven thousand dollars and that, maybe that's what you make in half a year, see?
Sure, sure. And for example, the clothes?
And without having a -- The clothes are expensive,buddy. Well, I don't know what Monica says regarding the clothes. I find it expensive.
What do you say, Monica.
It's expensive
Like I say, like Monica fell asleep, already.
No, it's expensive. It's expensive, Buddy. Yes, that it cost
Yes, but for example, here, so you have an idea, right? I bought these days some clothes, right? that's why I have the prices in my mind. Some Levis
Aha
that I just bought one because it was so expensive, some imported ones, brought directly from as they say
Mm.
they cost me fifteen thousand bolivar, that it comes out to be like one hundred dollars, or something like that.
No, no, well, here you can find it in thirty five or forty
Correct
Ah, well, imagine.
But, But it's expensive Buddy. Yes the clothes are expensive.
Mm. Okay.
I mean, we that are here on a scholarship, it comes out expensive, but, like Vladi says, the people that live here and make their monthly salary, forget it, they can buy
a pant each month and in a year they have twelve pants, and there's no problem, I mean, fine, they are not going to starve because of that
He doesn't hit him or anything.  Yes.
but the clothes are expensive, Guy. We haven't been able to buy hardly anything. We've bought the most necessary.
but in the in a condition of someone on a scholarship, right?
Yes, yes, correct.
Yes.
And one thing, the possibilities of a job position, for example, in Monica's case, who has a little more free time, nothing?
No, no, no here, she can't work because -- we, with scholarships, don't have access to work.
But not even as.
Look, that is not possible. I mean, maybe she can do it for a few days, but, but is not something like that that you say that is permanent, so.
Ah, sure. A temporary job.
Yes, yes, and suddenly a person comes and tells you, Damn and take care of the kids here, and they leave them and come to pick them up and maybe they give you something
or, or brings you something to eat, or, understand, but there's no fixed salary or anything like that fixed.
Sure. What
Look, and how are things in Venezuela.
Look, well, here, they already did a currency control. The dollar is at one hundred seventy, fixed.
Aha.
but, as it was to be expected, there's a black market, around that supposed currency control, and there are people by there, I don't know where, because I don't
without any need of dollars, but that have told me that to buy dollars at one hundred eighty, one hundred ninety, in the black market.
Ah, what
then it's generated a parallel market, so.
Here in the news, when the exchange rate comes out, it always comes out ninety five bolivars per dollar
he, and if he pays for it, if he is winning, then those are fucking excuses, they are there because she is lost
Listen to me
Oh
Let me ask you one thing, even if it sounds weird, one of these days mom told me --
What --
well, you know, I mean it is clear the Cucuta distribution among the three
Oh, at this moment I don't remember that nuisance --
Oh, because I hav- I mean, you know, I had understood it was half for each other, one half for you one half for me, and the other day mom came up with that it wasn't like that, that one half was hers and the other half, one half was hers and we only had, I mean it turns out to be a sixth --
Oh, I don't know, yes--
so she came up with that, and, and I told her, but it is funny that I didn't know, and she told me you knew, right?
Oh, that's nuisance, I don't feel like fighting for the money, not at all, no way
Me either, exactly
I remember the argument, I remember that moment, and I remember I told mom that because of the marital society she had --
She had one half
that she would get nothing of dad, that it was you and me that would get from dad, that she would get her part from the marital society
Aha, aha, Oh yes -- Yes, yes, yes, when --
then she came up with that it was her who had put the money --
Yes, she did put a little there, Mmm, yes
that she had got from the grandfather, that it was an inheritance and it was out of the marital society, so --
Yes, I know about that --
according in exact terms, those are not into a marital society, but all the revenues that have been produced, that has married daddy --
yeah, oh, no. This is a mess. Oh, no. Yes, I understand, yes.
it was in marital society, so, that if it has a percentage more, so the half of the other half, no, but --
Hmm. Oh.
Anyway, when you talk to her.
No, I go very bad there, because, because --
neither you nor me need the money, if that gives her --
yes, that was what I told, and then --
if that gives happiness to her, in her sixties what have --
Hmm, hmm, hmm, that we, yes,I understand -
gives more happiness, and she thinks she need more the money, she takes it and nothing more, I am not interested in that --
I think the same, yes, yes. No, I think the same, I think exactly the same as you, what happens is that it made me angry, like she telling me that as it did not matter, know what that is like that and I mommy, more than four years I know it now and then I had a discussion with her and told her exactly the same,
mommy, you need the money, we are professional, the she got offended because I said that, that I, That I told, and it became a mess, but I didn´t paid attention to it to not get into a discussion and I stayed quiet and told her and acted like a dumb.
Yes.
but, well, if it is a thing there because of that, she told me, if you want come and read, I didn´t, I didn´t read it, nothing, what a bullshit, neither that --
well, then it could not send or rent, we are getting out from so much exclusivity, and put it in another agencies -- that has a very bad image, some sellers have told us, in the moment, because it was the station Villa, many years ago, that is very hard, people has a very bad idea of that sector and that it is very hard to be sold, there we go with patience.
And hmm --
doing all we can.
Aha.
But, no --
Yes, no, you don't have anything, well that.
You can do nothing because it is out of our hands.
That gives you, gives you the recommendations, the only thing is the price of what they have constructed and have rented it, they have sold it for how much to know that --
Yes. The problem is that the sellers told us that while five properties are sold in the east, so, in this sector, one is sold over there. It is a thing that is more attached.
Yeah.
luckily that the property of Reyes is getting a value and sold there too. Very dirty, and cleaning and at last, say it is not worth to sell, that we have that, at last it is better for us to get a higher value.
It would be --
I have been in silence and -- then, well, you clarify to me and to talk to you too, for that part.
No, no she is the most harassed with her famous five stars  apartment , that is
Yes. But Ted has stopped her, because see, she has not be felt and she is inside a very big apartment. That is boring. Hear to me --
What --
between other things, you can, that if, if you need money, tell me with confidence ah?
Later, later.
many greeting to Luis.
Ah, thank you, the same for him. Eh, later. I have to find out about this hand that the week is over and begin to find out this week --
I don't know, as I see it,I can find a ticket more than fifty hundred, is harmful because --You know, in fifty hundred I can find it to Panama --
Hmm.
Ah, you should find out that, how much money a ticket costs, the cheaper you could, to Medellin, from Panama.
Ah, ready.
Or, or Medellin, Caracas, to say something, that is what --
Ah, well, even if it's a milkman
Yes, the cheapest that can be obtained there, I mean
Yes.
because here you find rates for students relatively easy for Panama or for Caracas.
And not for Colombia
Not for Bogota.
Ah, well, Luis.
And that does cost me like five hundred dollars fixed, already sure, then
Ah, well, and you tell me, what you need. Ah, what was I going to tell you, anyway I'm saving for the upcoming year, it will be to go to your grade, whether in March or whether in June.
Mm. yes, it's a long way to go yet
What, yes.
yes, yes, yes, what other
Ah, well,
Well yes in, is that it's no risk at all, if at the end you can't, well the worst that has happened to you, you've stayed with the money you saved and the money is good for other things you have thought of. It's not that I see that it can't be done, well, but
if I organized the trip, and, and we are counting with that, the worse that can happen is that we can't make it, and you didn't lose anything, you stayed with the money saved there
Finished. Ah, because if it's in March, I'm planning on not getting vacations in December
Okay.
to save them, because if it's in March, I'll request them, it can be at any time.
these days I developed some pictures. I have some pictures but I don't want to send them because I'm scared they'll get lost.
Ah, those always get lost
Mom's pictures, some pictures there of my mom. Tell her
You sent them too fat. Eh, dear me!
That you seemed
You sent them super fat. My God, what is this.
I, I lost, I lost weight with the first month of my vacations, and with them, with them I gained back what I had lost.
Eh, ah. No. And, it's the weirdest thing in the world, well since I didn't eat anything. but is that I hardly ate, I got fat and that's why I tell you that ah, no, a box of cookies daily
]
You looked like a little girl.
and I didn't know how to tell them that they looked like a ball, I felt so bad, listen - and I have her there kind of convinced, because I started there a diet and the story, but no
and she's exercising
Yes, at least she started, after a struggle and me after her, you'll see- because look is, that here, mom's situation is very sad, is very sad.
because, because she doesn't go to Cucuta anymore, she's like the whole day inside there, and I'm like working a lot then I barely, go one day of the week to her house, weekend that we go to the farm, we are going almost every eight days to the farm.
Mm. And how's the farm. Good?
It's good, it's nice. Eh, we are, with a used gate this Saturday.
Mm.
But it cost the same as the new one, which doesn't justify it.
Ah, yes, yes.
Then we are going for that, we talked with the locksmith.
Mm.
and we invented a so that the kids don't swing
I see.
and we had to order a new one because it was not worth it. It cost around four hundred thousand pesos, with columns and all
Mmm. I see. Mmm.
but we are running out of money Santi, that's the problem.
What is it, you are running out of money?
The account that we had before was named finca, it ends with the cover.
Oh yes oh but that's where the money from Cucuta came from, it was never missing
Yes, but it's over now.
Oh, yes.
I see well I think that it was a  bit of Cucuta but you have to continue paying Cucuta and all that
Oh.
and now with all these problems, now that it came out, if you'd see if Cucuta would lease it to you, that's where would get money but that's what we must consider, to see what we are going to do
so even though he wanted to give you the cover for when you come, well, the new cover. It's so pretty, we've changed it a lot, the curues are falling
Oh but why haven't you taken off, then.
yes, we are, we want to do that and also plant Lulu's crops because it's growing quite nicely, it's complicated.
And they promote it and they want to sell it, for whoever wants to sell it.
well mom, no mom, sold it to my neighbors and  only for our own use and now that it's night, Lulu would get mad, and see if we never ate
Yes, that's really good.
we are going to see if it's good, yes. So, let me found out about the ticket, anyway Santi. And is it going with apartment?
Fine, fine, oh, well this is the first month that, just now I took some money from the ATM, it's the first month that I finish the month and I get money from Co-futuro and I still have some money left in the account.
Ah, well, just as well. Listen, Santi, what do you think of and that we sow the lulu.
But I say that the crua, if the crua --
Or in blackberry.
if that was like that, if there are --
Yes, it's fallen then.
If they are not doing anything to him, well yes, and they are seeing that all that crua is bad, it seems silly to me.
Mmm. It's not that already --
And they should. And the lulu that they don't have to fumigate --
No, there's no need to fumigate it. Even in some things that came out in the paper about farming lulu, that I clipped --
Aha.
it says that yes, that it has certain, but Mario's grandfather says that no and, and, they swear that every three months of fertilizer, and they come up pretty
Ah, no then --
so it's like more uncomplicated, and then the lulu is more commercial than the curua.
Yes, that's also true. It's much easier to sell it.
It's easier to sell it, yes.
Sure, sure.
So those are the advantages and, maybe, I mean it's not with Roberto, that place blackberry, that, that --
Ah, with the blackberry --
The blackberry, you know that daddy gave him a lot and he gave him everything, what happens is that there they are fans of the blackberry. Roberto is a fan.
But, but that, that should really get fumigated a lot and --
gives so much trouble, aha.
Yes, and Yique then, what then, her stomach is big?
Yes, well. There you notice the belly. We already took some pictures. Well --
Aha.
I took, first, when it was starting to become noticeable, one
Aha.
and now that we went on a trip, some two or three --
Yes.
but it depends a lot on the clothes she wears
Really?
because you can't see it that much, sometimes --
No?
MM. She says that now you already see it with everything -- but I've taken pictures like that --
Ah, how nice.
Ah, there we send you some pictures --
And how has she felt, fine?
fine, she hasn't had any problems --
No?
no.
Good, good.
Fifteen days ago we went again to another ultrasound.
Ah!
Mm.
And is already very big.
Well yes, is not like the first anymore.
No, okay.
Mm.
You already saw it completely?
No, not anymore.
Okay.
You could see it better at the beginning
Yes.
Aha.
Yes.
And we took video and everything.
This time?
Yes, both times.
Really? Ah, how cool!
There we have the video and the pictures that they give
Aha.
Aha.
ah, how nice.
Mm.
Mm.
We already saw his hands and feet
Mm. How nice!
the second time, aha. Mm
Ah, that's good. And then you left on a trip to
Mm. We went to New York.
Mm
Mm
And very nice?
Yes, very nice. We took a bunch of pictures.
And you also went to Washington, or no.
Yes, yes we went to Washington, also.
Yes? AH
Aha. There lives, there lives Fernando's mom, right?
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
Carla is asking if you go her letter --
Ah, yes, that thank you very much.
Aha.
End, that I owe you.
Aha, you wrote me one also, one, saying --
Yes. The, you already also, I already got it, hallelujah.
Already got it. You will get another one, soon.
Ah, good.
Yes.
Let's see if it's true.
Yes, so that I seen you the pictures from the trip.
Ah, okay.
Mm.
Listen, And Danes, how?
He's here, yes.
yes? Is that my dad told me he was sick.
Well he gets some attacks there, suddenly, like he faints --
Mm. Ah.
but he's okay.
Really?
Mmm, mmm.
Ah, poor guy!
Who knows what it is.
And how did it go with the pension, good?
Good.
Yes?
Yes, and when we arrived, happy to see us, he was like crazy, very affectionate --
Ah, poor guy.
Mmm, and on the third day he had already forgotten it.
He didn't even recognize them.
No.
Bah. Well.
Mmm.
And how is it going, how is it going.
Good --
Yes?
Good, good. My mom told me that, that we're going to have a nephew
Yes.
Aha.
Yes, can you believe it.
And why in the letter first you tell me that is a girl and later
Is that the doctor said it looked like a girl --
Aha.
at four months, I think so --
Aha.
but he didn´t was sure of nothing --
Aha.
that if the next month he told us that was another thing, we should not get disappointed --
Aha.
but that doctor is very wise --
Aha.
then, because of that he told us that --
aha.
then, well, yeah, girl --
Aha.
Right?
And now it is
And the next month, the baby didn´t let him see --
Aha.
and now, the last month --
Mmm.
he told us already, yes, it's a boy --
Aha.
look, what's more, here are the testicles, one and two.
Aha.
There's no mistake, then. It's a boy --
And it cannot change.
You see that, when he saw it the first time, he was very small, that's why he said that he couldn't say anything for sure --
Mmm.
No but now he even said that, if it's not a boy, we'll see what I do --
Aha.
Because he says he then bets on the sex, and if he doesn't get it right, he pays for the birth.
Aha, aha, that's good, mmm.
So, because of that, well yes, but now, now yes, he's a boy.
It will be a boy and he'll be called Rodrigo, aha.
Yes, yes, and you?
Did you see the names that I wrote down? The same ones.
Yes, same as us.
Ouch.
Yes. Oh, that's great, but you wanted my mom told me, that you wanted a girl, no?
No, no, we like several, we like Ximena, Mariana, Fernanda, Isel-
Right, yeah, oh, that's cool
Uh huh, Ameyali
Oh, that's cool
But for a boy, we don't know
¿You don't know what for a boy?
No, no, we liked Rodrigo
Rodrigo and us, from the beginning we said, "no, if it's a boy, Rodrigo"
Rodrigo, right, and Fernando
Yes, uh huh
Right, do you remember my friend Rodrigo Fabela
Yeah, right
He has two brothers, one is Fernando and the other is Jorge
Oh, that's funny, that's why you don't want to name him Jorge, you don't want to
No, No, No, so he can have his name
Yeah
That, you know, with little Fernando (Fernandito), if i tell you Fernando, i know who I'm talking about
Well, who knows
Uh huh
Yeah
And like that you too if you tell me that Fernando whatever, and I don't know who you're talking about.
Yes.
mmm.
Yes.
So it's better that he has his name
Yes.
Mmm.
Yes. But it will be Georgina, no?
Well, according to my mom -- Eh, but, who knows --
Yes.
Let's see, what comes out.
And what, are you not dying to know?
Well, in part yes, and in part, no.
Aren't you tempted now that you're going for the ultrasound?
To know, no. We don't want to know.
No?
But afterwards we're going shopping --
Ah --
and we don't know which color to buy and then we buy everything green and red.
Oh, how nice.
Uh huh
Oh, because we, well now, with the kid and everything
Everything
Well, i have barely bought anything
Uh huh
but well, it's all going to be Fernando's
Right
i, i don't know if it's a coincidence girl, go figure
Right, everything new, ¿right?
You know what i- ¿come again?
Everything new
Yes
Uh huh
And it's gonna be a tomboy, because, [it's] all blue
Right, it's OK
Yeah, very cool
And school, ¿are you going or not?
Well, i signed up but only for two subjects, i already had to get discharged because those clowns, well, professor clown told me i had to meet eighty percent attendance
Uh huh
To earn the right to present to the finals
Hmm.
That I'll see, that I'll make my decision.
Aha.
What blood, hey.  They were looking at me with the panzorron, and --
And this teacher, from --
from industrial administration --
Aha, a vacilada.  This is optional, no?
No, it's obligatory.
And how many of these teachers are there?
Three.
You can enroll with the other.
Well I already made my change, but Adela didn't help me at all, nothing.
Hmm.
And I was, ground up and ground up --
Aha.
she didn't help me.  I went to look for her like five times --
Hmm.
I saw her once, I gave her my papers and my things, and she didn't do anything for me.
Aha.
And then she was never there and the inscriptions passed, so --
Mmm.
I already put in my change. If they give it to me, let's see if the professor with which I put it in accepts it --
Mmm, well --
and the other subject, I don't know, I haven't seen the professor --
Mmm.
but since it's of, subject already in my major, it's like it's a bit easier
Mmm.
because they're more accessible --
Mmm.
Don't you think?
It's fine -- Mmm.
Mmm.
aha.
And you, and what --
And I well, here, working --
Yes?
Mmm.
And if they let you come, if your supervisor lets you, to come in June?
, well I think so.
Haven't you told him?
Maybe in June, but, we'll see
You told me that you were going to talk to him, no?
Yes, we talked but the plan is for me to finish by next summer
Mmm.
Mmm, I don't know if in the beginning or at the end of the summer.
Well, in the summer.
Mmm.
You had said that maybe, no, or yes?
No. Yes, I believe that it'll be in the summer, yes.
Yes?
Mmm.
Oh, okay.
Mmm.
Mmm.
But I don't know if in the beginning or at the end.
Mmm.
and then, I don't know what I'll do next.
Oh?
Well, because, I don't know, if
You, my dad said that I should, I should ask for an international job, if you are going to try to come back to Mexico.
Mmm, mmm.
You get into something there and they would send you to Mexico --
Mmm. Yes, what happens is that since I haven't talked to him --
Mmm.
when I was going to come, everything was like I was going back to work with him --
Yes, but now as, well --
but not it's practically impossible --
well now dad doesn't even have anything --
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
where would he give you a job now
Mmm. So well now I don't know what I'm going to do. Eh --
No well, become someone's employee.
Aha. And maybe I have the chance of doing a post-doctorate.
Ah!
why do you say --
What horror!
It's good, work's really good --
Hmm.
aside from work, I'm doing a lot of translations --
Yes?
Eh, the last time, yes, several from German and from --
Aha.
and now, including one in Russian, one in English, you see --
Look at you --
Today, today they have to send me, they send me the work by fax, you see --
To see what level --
To see, this, this different -- but it's good for me, the people in the center, who doubted before, I tell them, no, well send it to me by fax, I quote it, and voila --
Aha.  That's good.
So it's, it's like, for the situation --
And what, and what did you have to translate --
And I had to translate a, do you know what one is?
Aha.
It's a landing bill, it's called --
Aha.
it's a document, you see, between the transporter, for example, and the --
Yes.
and the guy that sends the merchandise. After I had to translate to a musician
Mm, aha.
to a pianist, a couple of, a couple of things from, from German to Spanish, and others from Spanish to German, because the guy was in Germany and he wants to present something with the works in German, and later,
I had to translate a commercial letter also to German, and then a common letter from Russian and now I have to, today I have to translate a claim from Spanish to German
Look at you, good.
but all from different clients, see, so it's very good.
Mm.
so that no, no, with that you are, are, are very good.
And
So, I was saying no, see, no, that of your mom,  what at some moment that I can, but now it's the time, no it's the cash.
Mm. When do you have vacations
No, I don't know when, no clue
Mm.
no clue, but when, see, but well, when I have a girlfriend, I'm not going to have that much time neither.
Mm. Yes.
and when I have ten days, around there, I'm going to think if I can split, something like that
Mm. Yes, ah. Trying to combine it with a long weekend
Sure, do something like that, see, well, the desire I have, I don't know, you
Mm. And, trying to hook up again with the work, I'm being quite lazy lately, like
Mm.
nothing to do with the time when you were there, when you had the obligation of going to the faculty every day, and so. On one hand, I have my computer at home, that
allows me to work at home, but you know, that's quite a mess, because it is always easy to distract at home -- telephone calls, radio news, a TV program --
Of course
it is not that productive, I don't know, well also in the Faculty, there is always someone to interrupt you --
It's true, but it is less, it is less --
Eh?
There are less things to distract you
Yes, but there are the students and you start talking and so, at least at home I am always alone, in the Faculty there is a lot of people around you
Yes
Eh. No, it's just, let's see, in the times when I had to make a lot of calculations, mm, -- even without feeling like, I did it. Now I have to write more, I have to be inspired --
Sure, and he told me you had chosen a pretty tricky matter for your thesis --
Eh, yes, I wonder if you knew --
That you had a lot of calculation, how you call it? --
Yes, it is ha- it is harder to come up with a conclusion --
Sure, but besides they told you to justify all what San had told you and why, which is the hell of a work, he told me, right?
Aha, it is quite a big job, but --
Yes
No, let's see, right now it doesn't overwhelm me, I don't feel like the work overwhelms me, but -- eh, I don't know, I haven't managed to, it doesn't stimulate enough, I don't feel concentrated enough to --
progress. Lately, we finished the report, I had to write a previous report and I finished it, and then, since I had put so much effort in that, now I need to recharge energy, second chapter let's say --
and it's hard, mm, to get going
Yes.
or to get hooked again
Mmm.
Oh well, we little by little find some very interesting articles, so we summarize this article or something like that, and then we go deep into it a bit more
And what are your plans, what
doing, on the other hand, I'm doing some work for a professor, I'm trying to publish an article with another one and well
Oh, I see, you have lots of things going on at the same time
Yes.
Mmm.
And mmm-
that's the plan for the following months, do you plan to leave for a few days or something?
No, I'm taking a few days off, we are planning, we are kind of going out, I don't know how.
Mmm.
oh, to go out for a walk, he might come here, oh.
Oh, really? For Thanksgiving?
yes, yes, for Thanksgiving, it's a long weekend so we might go somewhere, she's from Connecticut, I went to Mark Twain's house.
Yes.
We went to visit it
Oh, she told me, your parents told me that you had
Aha.
being there, in Mark Twain's house, when you were in Connecticut.
Yes, and he's also the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin --
Yes.
Harriet Stowe or something like that --
Hmmm.
so, these are, these are interesting, let's say --
Mark Twain and then I read some stories --
Aha.  By whom --
I read a lot of stories by Mark Twain --
Aha.
They're really good --
Yes, they have many, many good things, that --
Really good --
He's the Woody Allen of the past century --
Yes, but no, no, but it's crazy.
Aha.
Crazy, you die laughing sometimes with the
Yes, there's a lot of irony in this sense the writers, so, critical, satirical of the reality around them.
I discovered some, well, little North American writers, who were great.
Aha.
You see, some selections, of stories, are really good.
You got them at school or where.
They had a bunch of good ones.
Mmm.
So, this, is that place okay?
Oh, yes, it doesn't make too much sense but it's interesting, oh, to see where that happened, they now have a museum, it's not really extraordinary or artistic, I don't know, I don't really care about that, they have all these Victorian houses.
Yes.
this, I don't know, it's silly but I don't really like it, the place that, with so much
That type, I see, did you go to Poe's
No. I was waiting, I told Mariza that we'll go there when she comes over to visit me.
Mariza, no, she asked for the address a lot of times, you have to have a couple of letters from her.
Mmm. I got them, I got one and I have, look, aha.
don't you have another one? She asked for your address just a while ago.
look, I haven't replied yet, sure, I don't know if I sent the card, I think I did but I have to write to her and to you too. To Mariza, her birthday is coming, next month.
Sure.
So, so, I'll use, well that will be an excuse for me to greet her for her birthday,
Sure,
to write to her. I'm so lazy but at least we can catch up through the phone.
Mmm. Hey, no, what was I going to say? Oh, I played a couple of matches.
The teams and then I played in the Metropolitan
No, no, no, the two in the, the two in the inter co-operative
Ah, aha and
yes one and a half in two
How big!
No, but the control, the control level that before would've won in simultaneous easy
Well, that, neither.
Yes, it sizes me, it's a detail. The second one I played
Aha
I sit next to the, the bear, who's a thief, that on top of that is the only one that plays and would get to play third or fourth board
Gustavo at first that they were killing him - when I went, I put it in -- That, Gustavo played two games and lost three.
But he's so strong, right, what he's too lazy
No, nothing like that, but, against Juan Perez, but in white piece, lost in Now besides see, like sacaque, that there's a bunch of guys that
Okay.
that don't play well, but that are not fools
Aha.
If you make a mistake, they kill you
If one makes a mistake
see, that eh, sure, when you make a mistake, and then the second one, I go to play, and Marcelo tells me, be careful, that this one plays well. In eleven, he lost.
The one that played well - Aha.
the one that played well, good the comment, and then didn't understand how, but listen to me, Marcelo, that guy
had lost --
That, we played, we play- played a Slav variant of the change and lost in eleven, listen, how will you do --
eh, what happens is that --
and the worst is that he abandoned too, he abandoned when everything was fucked
Marcelo says that he played well because once he won a ping-pong in the plant plaza.
Sure, surely, absolutely sure.
How is the plan going e-
No, he doesn't know, the guy was terrible, so that, well --
How is the school plan going.
Eh?
How is the school plan going.
The school plan --
Yes?
and well, for now until December they will be fine. From December until March they will --
I went, aha.
in April three will go up -- and, and apparently, as everything is coming, it's very fucked, you see. My brother is in the Municipality, now, working --
Aha. Who, aha.
Gustavo, and, and, he's still fine, he still didn't charge anything.
Aha
mm, I bought the kid a winter outfit ans hoes, no, not shoes, sneakers
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, of several sizes, I will send you. If it is too big, sell it.
Oh, right. This fatty. What do you think?
No, otherwise, save it, because the sneakers are very comfortable.
Sure, listen, thank you fatty
Yes, and, I don't know, I bought you sneakers, and some other things, but if you want something, tell me. What do you think? I bought Fino some ties, I don't what else I can send him.
I would like some sweaters
Sweaters. Oh, alright
Sweaters, aha, thermal sweaters, you know, that last for long, or otherwise one of those thermal jackets
Jacket, look the problem is that I will have it brought, I mean, a friend from here will bring it --
Oh, yes
I can't send things too bulky, you realize. A sweater --
I see, I see
sweater, I may be able to send it. But jackets, jackets would be a big bulk. When I come I would bring you a jacket, but --
I see. Listen fatty, by the way, when will you come? is it going to be awhile yet?
No, no, next year for sure
Oh, next month? November?
No, next year, next year, yes
Oh, I see. I said, already fatty. Are you fat or what?
Yes, No keep talking, keep talking, we still have time; the call is free, so, take advantage of it eh,
You're still fat, dear.
Ah, more or less, but I keep losing weight little by little.
Ah, okay.
I'm going running, I exercise a lot, and all that.
And the English, dear, how is it going.
You can already imagine, morning, afternoon and night, I even think in English already.
Listen, dear, and that techno course, how is it - how in Hypnopaedia, Hypnopaedia, how is it, ah?
No. It's a silly thing. It's not good for anything. Aha.
A silly thing? Why?
Nothing. The only thing it does is stress you out. That's my opinion, only, it stresses you more, just, because it doesn't let you sleep peacefully.
Okay.
Eh, in my opinion, the best way is, studying English.
Talking?
Talking, no, no, if you can't talk with someone, with cassettes, or books or with the teacher, right?
Okay.
but that of, of
Okay, okay, okay.
studying on your own, if you don't have the foundation, it does you no good at all.
Aha. You need to have a good foundation. But, it will have some result, I say. Something, ah.
¿Which one, the hipnopedia?, i don't know, i couldn't tell you  about it at all. But in my opinion, i don't think it's gonna work out right, compared to a formal learning, yeah, through cassettes and all that, the other one is better
No, no, right
¿And what news are there?, ¿what can you tell me about my dad, my mom, how are they?
Oh, yeah, mom's fine and all, shes at... my mom, she'll probably come this week
Uh huh
Angela traveled yesterday with merchandise, dad's fine, he had a problem with his tendons, it seems he's suffering from overweight
Uh huh
But he's better now
Uh huh, right, uh
And Finito, we operated Finito this month because of his hernia, in November, yes
Yeah, but nothing serious
Yeah, because... no, it seems it's a little of, ¿what's it's called?, it's decreasing, ¿what's it called?, oh, i can't remember it
¿All the testicles are descending?
Oh, no, uh, that thing we have near the stomach, oh, ¿what's it called?
¿The belly?, ¿the belly button?, ¿what?
No, well, the thing is it's necessary, Jorge too, no, not the belly button, oh, the intestines
The intestines we have near the belly, you're more
Well, in the belly then, Margarita is laughing
That's fine, you don't change
Well, at least i explain myself, oh, Fatty
You are, hahaha!  And now it's Wednesday, I think.
Yeah, and what does he say.
He was half asleep.  Ah here he is.  He's good.
Ah, he's there near you, if you know how he is.
Yes.  Tona is studying there in Orolla, no?
Yes.  Yes, she's just here now, he traveled, but --
And how is it going for her?
According to Jorge - yes, more or less, here she's starting, well, introductions, all of these things.
Yes.
Yes.  It seems like she's taking an interest.
What plans does Angela have, do you know?
No, nothing.
Nothing.  She's in the same thing.
Angela, ah, Angela needs to grow up, I say.  Mature to the thirties, I say.
But she's in the same things.
Yeah, in the same, even if, a little, she's a little bit realized the situation she's in, no?
Hmm.
But, to change totally, she has to mature, mature, if not, she won't get ahead in anything, neither forward nor backward, hmm, so.
Hmm.  Yes, well.  Manuel?
Manuel is, well, here he's not studying any more, but he's in the, with the store,  He's more driven, more responsible.
Yes. That he doesn't waste his time that mate. That he studies.
Mm. Yes well, the problem also is that the money goes flying in everything. It's not enough for anything and
Mm.
Bonnie is finishing her, her class. And she's well, advancing on her own on the computer and also there studying.
Mm.
Mm. Yes well, besides all that, we are fine, trying one way or another.
Sure, it has to be like that. And, what is it called
Mm. Listen, Dear
Mm. What.
Listen, Dear, a car, can you buy it there for here?
Yes, but taking it costs more than the car.
Ah, really?
Yes, well, here
A
here it's cheap, okay?
There are
Good cars and cheap, used or new, whatever.
Okay.
but taking it from here to over there costs a lot and also they charge taxes in customs, and also they give you a big hassle, you know how customs is in Peru. It's better to buy it there. That
Mm, And, listen dear, and speaking of problems. You think the Chinese will win?
The chinese, well, i don't know, this punk is picking up
¿Toledo?, ¿Toledo?
Toledo, but i don't know, i wish, i wish the Chinese loses, because he's an asshole
Oh, that's true
But, well, i don't know
But the people, polls and all, there's a high percentage in favor of him
Oh
The chinese, because it says that no, he's gotta end his work on the second period, if not, another will go in and
And will slap the, he will slap the offices of the, of the Intelligence Service everywhere and it will be a dictatorship
No, ¿isn't that HIS goal?, i don't know
He, yeah, everything that has happened is the work of the Chinese
That isn't, i think so too. The paper says that he endorsed, that Manrique had paid for his previous propaganda, something like that
¿Do you think that, do you think he would be so...?, that's politics, those are scapegoats
Oh
The big fishes are the chinese's people, huh
¿Which one?
And you, forget Manrique, they're not gonna get him, and if they do, he'll escape again, they'll put him in a golden jail
Uh huh
Uh huh, yeah, for all of that, the Chinese is an asshole, and there's nothing to do
Yeah, yeah, it's true
So they are going to a wedding they say, right. Whose wedding.
Mm. the cousin of Joy's sister-in-law.
Cousin of Joy's sister-in-law, ah?
Aha.
Ah.
Yes, a little while only, because
Listen, it's true that, it's true that the sister-in-law got married
I don't know, that I don't know. Who told you.
Oh, the drunk.
Ah, that I don't know, but the drunk always lies, mm.
Yes but you know, yes but you know how the drunk is, mm
No, I don't know anything.
But I think that yes, ah, because do you remember the stuck up sister-in-law, of the, the skinny one
Yes, yes.
I mean that they already had, they were going get married like twice, that was
Ah yes? Mm, no, no.
They are already bored, already.
Yes. And how were they going to get married, then. I don't think so.
No, well I don't know. The same it could be that they got married. It could be.
Mm. No, they haven't told me anything.
Mmm.
He didn't say anything. Oh, the one that is going to get married is Kike.

Yes. No. No, no, no.

Please get me Atahualpa's phone here in Canada or his address please send it to me by email, please.
But, how can we found it? Through his sister?
No well, I can call you next week or in a couple of weeks and you should have it by then, okay. Who are you asking for it? His dad or his mother, his brothers

Nine p.m., oh, so it must have been around six p.m. here, ¿when did he call?, yesterday
Sure, oh, right
We were outside
Anyways, he'll call again anyways, since there's a competition here of, of
Sure, of course. The offer, sure, uh huh

Yeah.
But I'm well phisically, what happens is that all of a sudden I --
Ah, yeah. Mmm.
I don't know if, well according to the doctor it's like a psychosomatic reaction --
Yeah.
the colon, all that type of things, it's resented.
Have you felt problems?
Sure, and that makes me feel like poorly, somewhat depressed like the organism is, I don't feel very good --
Mmm.
So it depresses me a bit, so it's like a vicious circle, so that me--
And they are
That what it, Ah?
Are they, are they giving you antidepressants?
Ah, yes but he told me to continue with it because he doesn't like that I'm with the antidepressant, too long.
Okay
because no, he tells me that it's more of a thing of anxiety, distress, but it's gone away, ah, I mean, I've been much better,
Listen, weren't you going to go to therapy with a psychologist, And, have you gone? have you continued going?
Yes, yes. Yes but what happens is that it does me more good going to the psychiatrist.
Why
Because they handle the therapy better
It depends on the psychiatrist, logically, because there are psychiatrists that don't do anything, but I tell you
Ah, sure
but is a good psychiatrist, I mean, is it a woman?
It's a woman. And since she's a woman, it's better, then I'm going a while with her, and the other thing is that
Okay. Okay.
is like more, more since, they can give license.
She gave you the license.
Sure.
For how many days.
Eh, for ten days.
Ten days. And which one is the
No, she's really nice, oh?
Oh?
Oh?
What did you say?
What? No, that she's nice, I mean, a good psychiatrist.
What, what's the goal of the license now?
To rest. She told me that I'm so stressed about the trip and the routine of going to and from work, I'm a bit scared by it, I got scared of traveling because I couldn't get out of bed in the mornings.
so, the fact that I had to go to work, to take the bus, to spend two hours, oh?
Are you going to the same place? Are you going to the same place?
Oh, yes, I haven't been able to change. So, she told me to rest for ten days so that I would break the routine, sure.
I see.
But it's something like that.
Therapy, yes.
You know what, I'm still very, after my surgery.
I see.
It was too much for me to have to take the bus.
Oh I see.
it hurt, my tummy hurt-
I see.
for the movement, do you understand?
Sure, and that affected you.
so, every little thing
Mmm.
that I felt in my body would scare me so, so-
Sure.
Oh, I started to feel a bit
No, I see, fine, the physical part and the emotional part of it.
I mean, it's connected. She told me that it was a psychosomatic reaction and that caused me to
I see. Yes. No, sometimes, sometimes, it can be both things sometimes.
that I would worry, lets say. Oh? Sure, it's connected but I'm fine, I mean, she told me that I should rest, in reality, well, if you calm down for a while, and and
Fine, you have to try to help yourself because-
Sure.
we are all worried about you, specially your mom and dad, isn't it? They-
Sure, yes.
they are worried about you, so, because-
Yes. Yes, well no and now-
Yes, no-
As I said, I'm resting and that's fine for me because that way
Sure. Go out a little
by being outside sometime, oh?
you break your daily routine, as you say.
Sure, I break my routine. You know what, George, I'm going to have to change jobs, I mean,
Mmm.
from work because it's affecting me. I realize that it is affecting me.
Hey, because you give so much, thought, to the same issue, the same one, when you realize something you must change and that's it.
Sure, the problem is that there's no much change here.
No, yes, I know.
I mean, there are not lots of change possibilities, they are all in other places that are full, do you understand? I've tried to look for a different place because I did get an offer but it didn't materialize in the end, so I have to start over again, the man
Hey, but that's good, you should put more work into studying English, Betsy.
Yes, well, I'm trying.
Oh, but try hard.
I spoke with a lady.
Hey, look, listen to me.

Well, yeah

Well, well, take care
Long story short, i don't know if mommy explained it to you
Right
the thing is that this is being recorded by a computer
Right, right
So we should try not to speak nonsense
Well, right
It doesn't matter what we talk about, the computer is recording all our way of speaking
Right, right
Because computers, later on, will be keyless, they're gonna recognize our voice
Oh, look at that, yeah, right, yeah, that's nice

and we were singing really loud, eh, loud singing singing Luis Miguel songs, and making a mess --
Ah.
eh, it was like in the south part --
Yes.
but and and we got there and they were setting up a, a Latin party
Oh, what
and they played merengue, salsa and I was trying to teach an American that worked in the University, he's a black guy, he's really nice and I was trying to teach him how to dance merengue and
To dance?
and salsa but it was hard, and then on Saturday I was barely able to get out of bed because I'm not used to walk with flat shoes.
Oh boy.
And as I brought no other shoes, I had to buy some flats, black
Yes, sure.
and it turns out that they didn't have my size, mom because everybody here has big feet and then Susan had to take me to a children's store.
Big?
to see if I could get some shoes. In the end, we did find a store that had small shoes for me.
Oh. Oh, great.
But no, mom, it's great. What else can I tell you? What can you tell me mom, tell me something because they are taping us and we need to speak, mom
Yes. No, everything has been fine, thank God, Yolanda is so fat and all, but everything is fine, she went to the doctor last Tuesday and he said she was fine.
Oh, that's great. What did he say?
And I, that the baby is misplaced but she shouldn't worry because she's doing really well.
Oh, great.
She just needs to rest a bit.
Oh, and she told me yesterday
Yes, all of us are fine, German, Hector, we are all fine, thanks.
Hector's working with those at Uniplan.
Yes, yes ma'am, he will have to travel to Medellin again to resolve a case there.
Ah, good.
But everything's good, he had the idea to call Patricia Mendez, but --
Aye mom, yes, call her and tell her I say hi and that if she got the card that I sent, I sent her a card.
Aye, but we moved about a year ago from hers and Susan's --
But it's very strange, mom, because I didn't get anything.
Strange,
Aye, and, last night was the election of the Miss Colombia?
Ah, yes ma'am, the one from Cesar one.
And who won, and how was it.
Hmm, good, we all agree.
And how is it this year, was there the same mess from last year?
Well everything, yes, the one who wasn't happy was the little black girl from Choco, but no.
But was there the same problem for last year, or was it less messy.
No.  No, no, less messy, and there were smaller ones, eighteen candidates, but they were very pretty --
Yeah.
But really pretty dresses.  And last night I saw the whole reign here, but well, I reminded my daughter --
But my mom's, but my mom's good, or not.
Fine, fine, thank God, logically I miss you, but I'm very happy --
Oh well, mommy
to know that you are right and that you are studying and happy in the university
Yes, that's
I felt really bad yesterday when the call dropped, but, oh well.
I was like, God knows why things happen because when I heard that you started to cry
Mmm.
I was going to say, no, no, no, because you are going to be heard crying in the tape and that is not good
Yes. No, no, no, it's because Yolanda had just brought me breakfast, a fabulous breakfast and
Mmm.
we had just finished having breakfast with Natalia.
I see.
Mmm and with Juan Camilo, they gave me some really nice presents and flowers and we had, well we had lunch with Carlos and Olga who were there
Aha.
at the state, in La Calera-
Aha.
for a while but German was drunk so we had to come back around six.
That's weird.
And they stayed there.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ah, mommy.
Yes, ma'am. And what else. And Susan, fine?
Fine, fortunately, yes, she's very good. Sometimes, her back does hurt a little, but
Ah, jeez.
but, but no, she's already fine, ah, and the cats are gorgeous, mom, here they are next to me
Yes, you've become fond of them?
Yes, mom, that, I, one should say in life, nothing, that I would say that I couldn't stand cats
Yes, nothing. Yes.
there's one that's very funny, small, he sleeps on top of my leg
Ah, ah
he would always sleep on Susan, and lately, they hadn't wanted to sleep with me, but lately
He got attached.
yes, he's very funny because one moves and he moves and positions himself on top of the leg again, is
Ah, well, how nice.
so funny, but they are cute, they are very nice.
I'm very glad. And how's Susan family.
No, mommy, there's hardly any contact with them. Hardly none, none.
No, ah, well.
Oh, that is, plus is that she has friends, and with the friend from Boston, ah, I didn't send the picture
Ah, really.
When we were in Boston, we were at a friend of hers, his name is Joghn Yuyo, he's from an Italian family, but
Oh
But he's, he's from here
Oh
And it's so funny, oh, we were so happy in Boston, because he's really tall
Oh, well, I'm very glad. Greetings from Olga, oh, i almost forgot, Lucia called

Mmm, and what about Orlando

Because I called him brava, brava.

He was not brave enough to tell Nora, because they never talked about it again.

Nothing, in fact, the called just happened a while ago, but that´s it
OK
good job, I got very angry that day

Yolanda What?

Mmmm
since you live there , you know.
Mmm. I told you
Mrs.
Well, since you already have Nora and Lidia helping you in Bogota, i mean, and you have time to travel to Spain, no, i didn't tell you, but almost, put yourself upfront, i told you, please, i cannot waste, i cannot waste money because I'm already very deeply in debt with this trip and
Sure
Oh, well
Yeah, i told her, they don't have, but well, no job
Yeah, oh, uh huh, it's hard
Oh
That's hard, and since my mom knows i have the visa, she's
Oh
Well, it's complicated, but we'll see if
Yes, ma'am, oh, well, i was very glad when, when i heard about
And, ¿what else?, oh, mommy, yesterday i got upset too, because we were starting to talk now, it's just
Yes, yes
This is a new program, so they are still making some changes to it
Oh, a promotion.
Yes, they are fixing it and the computer
Yes, that is mentioned in the brochure.
They do?
Yes mam.
You see, that's what they are doing with the
The parabolic, mmm, yes mam.
the university, then. And mom, tell me what has happened back home, is it over now?
No mam.
Is she still on it?
Oh, she's still in it, I think she'll finish in
And what has happened?
I think she'll finish in January.
I see.
Oh, fine, fine, she's alright but the other man is pretty jealous, he has gone and make a fuss with the boss
I see.
her boss.
I see.
But, she's doing alright.
Mmm.
So, well, it happens to me often. I used to walk straight and nothing would happen, I would spin but now it's like I get dizzy and I have to wait a bit before I'm able to keep walking, I'm in lots of pain
in my elbow, you can't, you have to wait for the pain to go away and even now when I'm not turning or spinning, I still feel it. It bothers me a lot.
Yes.
and well, I'm worried because I'm in a insurance policy from my work but to belong to it, I mean, you have to
there are different levels, bronze, silver, gold, platinum
Yes.
so, it depends on which level you are, the insurance amount and it's a bit, you have to do some calculations, it's like a prize.
Aha.
But they also take in consideration the conservation, I mean, if the clients doesn't cancel it
Mmm.
And this year, I've done horribly in the conservation, last time they bought me a huge insurance, a thousand dollars every six months, a professor from the Technological, he was the principal of the Economy course.
Oh
No, not Economy, Marketing and they gave us a course, lots of people, I talked to him and everything and he did buy it, he paid the first year, six million but he hasn't paid this year and that has affected me
And the conservation, well I'm not doing fine in it and so I lost all the prizes because I do have sales but not conservation, and well, I've lost millions of Pesos.
Yes.
So next year, I mean, this club is an annual thing, they lower or increase it depending on your income.
Mmm.
but I'm sure they'll take me out because I have earnings but not conservation. Sadly, I must hurry and have surgery because I'd like to be healthy when you are here and to use it while I still have it.
Yes.
Even though anyway I plan to buy the medical expense policy, but here they have a system that if you have a group policy, I don't know what happens they do not take you into account for-
for the things you previously had and since this is a previous process, in other words, it is not something which appears from one day to the next.
The problem with the knee.
Yes, and with the gall bladder also. Then,I will have to do it and do it now.
Yes.
I in fact had postponed it because there are weeks of recuperation and I have no way and the this has made me miss certain bonuses which would have increased my, my income_
Yes.
But since I have also been paying two and a half million monthly mortgage payments, well things have been rough, as you can understand.
Yes.
Then, but now, now thank God, this month I will be done, I will finish paying off the loan the last day of Ju- of November-
Aha.
And, so there, there we go.
Listen, what happened, Rocio told me, Claudia that the Rocha bit Baltazar.
So look, what has happened is Baltazar has always played a lot with Rocha and they rough house  then they say she was very sad because I left-
See, who knows if it's true, it should be,because I, for example,if I don't go out at night to shower him with love, caresses, sweet talk, the dog will not sleep, goes around peeking through windows, desperate, barking and everything, I just go out, caress him and he falls asleep, believe it or not.
What happens is no one gives affection to that poor dog.
Exactly, then well for sure what do I put, look, they put croquettes and he doesn't eat, I go and caress him and he starts to eat. Then Licha says he didn't want to eat, the dog was too sad, Baltazar starts playing with him in that way, well the dog was not in the mood.
Yes.
And he says he put his foot on his back and the dog - bit him really bad. Today Baltazar showed me the-
the bite, and they had to give him three stitches, and the strange thing is I don't, I don't know how he could have bitten him, I feel it is the strength of the dog who weights forty five kilos and who, well was very angry.
Yes.
Because it didn't break the pant but it did break the leg.
What happens is that the fangs, the fangs are very sharp.
That's why, Jorge, but since it didn't break the pant.
Well if the fangs didn't go through, well anyway. What happened with Rocio and Baltazar, they already went back or what.
Well yes, they've already been two months.
Of being boyfriend and girlfriend again.
Sure, no, yes Rocio doesn't learn.
What an idiot.
No, and well I tell Rocio, abused, Rocio, abused, because she now well, now already with a car, realize that Baltazar doesn't come to her anymore she goes to his house.
That's why I don't see it right either, I told her, Rocio why do you make it so easy for him, now he doesn't even come, you go
But well, she says she prefers to make a mistake than to regret it later on.
Well either way she'll regret it. right?
That's why, but make a mistake of, of that it was my own fault, I decided it, but remember that I'll decide it, not you.
Well yes, yes, but yes is yes, you see, she wanted to be like my aunt Chata that everyone told her not to marry my uncle Raul.
What happened was that, remember the people, the marriage is not to change, the marriage you don't change anyone, neither one nor the other, if you go with the idea that we get married and I make you change, it's a lie, later the school, the marriage is not a school, you are not going to learn
mmm, you have to be very sure that the person you are marrying, his, his defects, which we all have, are not important enough to make your life impossible
Yes
Because otherwise you're gone. But anyway. They say that everybody wants to try it in his own head
Oh, well, hello?
Yes, I'm listening
Oh, it's alright, it's just that my telephone fell
So this is what we found, and the dog is quiet. Some time ago came Baltazar, he brought a little goose and gave it Baltazar, perfect, the dog didn't try to attack it or anything, he was quiet, and he told it sit down, and it sit and he gave it --
breadcrumbs, Rocio didn't want to, she gets very nervous, but it doesn't do anything to them, it plays with the children of Manuel, and Manolito is smaller than the dog but it didn't do him anything
Anyway, Rocio says that Baltazar didn't do him anything, but he plays to kick him and that's how he played with his dog, you know, but one thing is your dog and anoter thing  is someone else's dog. It's just that the dog was in a bad mood
And it's funny, because the dog usually enjoys seeing other dogs, that's what all dogs do, but that's why it scares me taking him out, because besides my knee doesn't feel very safe, and he is very heavy for me, very, mm, he is too strong for me --
he pulls me and knocks me, I could take it out every day and besides I would like to go for a walk because I have been sick, but I am scared because I limp a lot now, and it can hurt my
hip, the other hip, or the spine or something, because well some consequence may have the limping
Yes, but you're acting bad with that dog, honestly, you never take it out, the dog is always inside
That's true
So, I wonder if Clara brought the mail I sent her toady, but --
She brought it a minute ago, she came for the money
where I tell you that what called my attention since the first moment I was here is that the dogs are not aggressive, not even to other dogs or humans, ah, there are some races, a German Sheppard for instance, and --
if you want to enter the owner's house, the it'll bite you, but if it they are walking it in the street, bah, bah, bah ]--
In the street, first of all there ain't, in Canad there are not loose dogs in the street
There are no dogs, no loose dogs, it's just that an annoyed dog, dogs, when they are so annoyed, neurotics, they are like --
yeah, that's equal to four milligrams --
Yeah.
of Dexametasona --
Yeah.
together with a cubic centimeter or a thousand milligrams --
Yeah.
or a thousand milligrams of vitamin B twelve.
Yeah.
Yeah, both together, in the buttock, as an injection.
Yeah.  Both together, yeah.
This is to lessen the inflammation of the nerve of his brain and all that.
Yeah, but they're giving him, they're giving him --
Through his mouth.
so that he, yes.
But the injection is more effective.
Yeah, but no, it's not crossed if they also give him the injection?
No, no, no, it's not crossed, because they give it one day but not the next --
Yeah, Juan.  Great.
or giving, or giving two days --
He's worried about --
or from --
Yeah, Antonia was worried because she didn't have an answer from her letter.
Yes, yes.  I didn't answer anything, because I've been really busy.  I have a lot of debt and I've tried to bring the mom of Irma because we need her.
Yeah, the last time --
the
the last time Antonia came here --
Yeah, how is she?
She came here on Monday --
Yes.
to tell you something because the sister of Irma came and said that Monday you would call here --
Oh, no.
and this of the --
he says that
Yes, he said that, that Antonia had been there from three almost until seven thirty, when she went to see the baby.  They now tell my dad that the baby --
so, because it was very late, and --
Yeah, no, no, no --
we were waiting for the call here --
Oh, look, they say that they said I was going to call you at home, your mom, she says -- Yes
like she said you would call Monday, that Irma would have called, that Irma had called her and said that Monday at five, that at four --
Monday at four was when you were going to call her house fro-
it was about, about last week, this week
of July, you told your sister, you have told your sister --
Then Antonio has come with Diego
Yes she hasn't talked to her sister, she has talked to her mom. Which sister?
I don't know which one, Bety I think, but he says to go and see if she would give a call to Antonia
she says that you have called for Anto- mom to go to your house so I call, I was going to call on Monday and mom would be waiting all day long for me to call and I didn't call on Monday. No, it was not like this, she's wrong, she understood it wrong, your mom understood it wrong.
Sure, sure. That's what I thought, that she had understood it wrong
Yes, otherwise I would have --
No, Antonia, no
otherwise I would have called. Look, this --
I know, but anyway
Ok. You wrote down the medicines, didn't you?
Yes, yes, here it is, already
Alright, look, Mauro, if you can, find him--
Yes
Alberto Gallardo --
I know
do you know him? do you remember him?
Where is he?
I don't know where he is, but asking the friends, there --
Yes, oh, I see.
Farias or anybody else, Meza, to them
I see
it depends on whether they connect the phone, then you call them
Perfect, tell me about the
he's, he's the
didn't you get anything in the lottery?
Not yet.
I see.
This, he's a neurologist.
I see.
I see, he's my friend, so, he can, he could take a look at my dad.
I see. We'll see, we'll see
I already asked for his number but he hasn't send it to me yet, not yet
We'll see. Okay.
he hasn't, he hasn't, if not, I can call him from here
Perfect. How much-
this, but he's, he's, is my dad better now or not?
Yes, well, I haven't seeing him this week, what can I say, but Antonia
He was doing better.
Yeah, he's happier now, because Antonia, uh, what... his arm hurt and the way i gave her more or less, to put an... to strap him up, because yeah, my dad was walking with his arm down, and well, his blood was getting stuck there, since he doesn't move it, it gets swollen
Right, no, right, right, they didn't take him to the Tesa, right
No, no, no, they haven't taken him to the... they were thinking about taking him, yeah
Right, look, just buy him those two, those two remedies and apply them, leaving one day
Right
Afterwords, if it improves, leaving two days apart
Right
And after that every week if he gets well
Right
And later on, if he's better, he doesn't need it anymore
Oh, right
¿Okay?
Yes, yes, ¿how much, how long is this call?, ¿how many minutes?
About half an hour
Oh, half an hour
Yeah, there they, they
Oh boy, Antonia should have been the one talking to you
Yeah, well, we didn't know
Yeah, because she, she wanted that half hour, ¿right?, they said that half hour was gonna be on Monday
Of, no, no, she says you told her that the half hour was gonna be on monday, to talk to my mom, and well, the thing is we want to bring her mom, Irma's, but we couldn't, her Visa has been denied
Yea.
There there is a, there there is a lawyer --
Ah, yeah.
that is dedicated to making those papers --
Yes.
yes, I don't know how much he will charge, nothing, we're looking into that because here we need someone that helps us,
Yeah, yes, well. Sure.
and you mom would be, would be eh, a good help --
That's very good.
for us and I could try to dedicate myself to passing my exam because I'm more prepared and I also really want it
Ah, that's good.
I want it more to pass already --
Yes, well, that's necessary, still the time that you are there.
th- then I need someone to look after my daughters now that they are bigger and also, eh --
That's very good. Yes.
Yes, eh, what other thing, I already received many letters from Diego that says that he cannot come because my dad, yes no,I would bring Diego, with the lady, because Diego --
Yeah, but there is a, there is a, there is a that they have sent yo since about fifteen days ago like that, that there is no response, where they told you all the problems, ah?
Yes, yes, I already received it.
Ah, yeah, Very good.
that Diego that he didn't want to come for the thing with my dad, but well, it now depends on him, but if he wants to come we can bring him through Mexico with the lady, let him come if he wants to
Okay.
because he he here if he had a job, here he would make good money, since he's single well -- he could help more, help my dad better and all from here, sending money right?
Very good.
he's single, he here would make at least his six hundred, eight hundred dollars monthly
Ah, okay, okay, okay.
and here there's plenty of work for
Sure, sure.
here there are a lot of Peruvians coming, they are coming so, they are, are with their jobs so
Yes, well, that's very good.
There's a man of, there's a sixty seven year old man who has arrived and he's working peacefully
Good heavens, how nice, ah? how nice, how nice.
Yes, but he can't get accustomed, he can't get accustomed because this man is married and has all his family over there
Ah, sure
here he's making his seven hundred dollars monthly, but he tells me, no, I don't get accustomed, or I'm going to save up until December only and I'm leaving, he tells me.
Ah, okay. That already
He saves a little money and all, his kids are over there, he's alone -- but for Diego that would be a different situation, except if he misses
No, Diego would be fine, yes so
if he misses, well, he can go back, there's no problem, I rather have
No, he would be fine there.
I am rather getting accustomed already, everything is more tranquil, I'm more used to it already
It's going really well.
but in any case --
There you have a lot of --
in any way, what I want is to pass my exam.  Irma can put her clinic.  We're looking to put our clinic to care for births.
She got her, she got her license already.
Very good, ah.  This is perfect.  Great.
So we're seeing all this, this --
Ah, sure, sure.
And how are things with you over there?
It's perfect.  Well, here, well, it's going.  Ah?
You're things are OK with your sciatica, with your sciatica.
Yes, I feel good, so, thank God, above all because the medicine, I was taking medicine.
Yeah.  Look, listen to me.  The same medicine, the same medicine that I gave you for my dad --
Yes, yeah.
it's the same for you --
Ah, yeah.
every other day, in your buttock.
No, well, I've been, I've been taking vitamins, all the B vitamins, B two, B, B one, B two, B sis, B twelve --
Yeah, yeah, yes.  But it's better to inject it, brother.
And I stopped taking them and this happened to me.  I was taking these vitamins for like a month.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Because somebody recommended to me for, it is said, for hair loss, for all.
Yea, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
A doctor, and I was drinking, well yeah, and later I stopped drinking and began to carry water --
Yeah. Is not water there?
Two buckets of water --
Is not water there?
No, there is, but so. There is water, there is, but what happened is that the service was suspended --
Yeah.
And although I gave to a neighbor from here to pay it well right? --
Hmm.
I thought he was going to pay it, two and a half months later, I thought he had paid it and --
Hmm.
suddenly, one day I arrived at night the service was suspended and in the morning I fixed it myself and fixed it the same day but I had to carry water --
Yeah.
around five buckets of water, with the fifth one I couldn't move, like a board, like if I had a board in the lower part --
Yes, you have made a big force.
and I could not bend down or climb, and could not get in the car, or the bus, a problem, ah.
damn you have felt bad with that.
Happily is gone and now I am, it is that I stopped doing exercises. Yeah.
Yeah, this recipe that I gave you, this recipe that I gave you, it's for sciatica, for all the nerves, this recipe I gave you.
Ah, yeah.  How are, how are the girls?
They're all good.
You're all good.
I'm better, I'm better, I'm going to therapy, well brother, psychology.
Ah, yeah, that's good, ah, that's perfect.
Eh, they give you a lot, a lot of crazy tests, considering that I studied medicine and everything, eh, how to apply it.  I'm doing tai chi -
yes, well it's another area, you learn a lot.
I'm doing oriental medicine too, tai chi -
Ah.  Ah, yeah.  yes, yes, yes.
Do you know what this means?
Exercise, it's an exercise in concentration.
Yeah, to enjoy your movement.
Yes, yes, yes.
Like they teach you certain movements --
I have a little book on it here.
Yeah, it's good.  Mauro, I just wanted --
I have the little book here, but it didn't give me the imp-
I wanted to talk to you about this --
This is for kung fu, then.  For kung fu.
Yeah, no, no, this isn't, it's kung fu, no, it's tai chi that --
No, this is for kung fu.
No, no, no, no --
You use, it's the base of kung fu.
Yeah, sure.
Yes, I have a teacher who's from kung fu --
Yeah, that's good, but here, here the --
he told me that this was important, complimentary --
here the apply it so that --
well it's a therapy then, for health, it's a therapy --
Sure but the philosophy is that the movement --
movement doesn't have space, it produces pleasure.
what movement does is distribute energy through your whole body.
Yes, well.
so you have to concentrate and see that your whole body is full of positive energy, only good things --
Aha.
eliminate everything that's --
Yes, well.
negative ideas, like, eh --
Yeah.
here there's a great psychiatrist, I'm reading one of his books, that says that simple, hello
give me my shirt, Esther.
Hello.
Yes, hello, I'm listening to you, I'm listening to you, hello, yes.
that simply, everything, everything is our idea, that if there's a negative idea passing through your head, well your body breaks down.
a while, okay, yes Juan, continue.
Your body breaks down, then
Okay, is that I was going to, was going to, was going to bathe and I'm without a shirt. Yes.
Ah, put your shirt on, you'll see.
I was just now going to bathe, yes.
Put your shirt on, old man.
And they can't give you like that so one day Antonia can come?
No, not yet. Thirty minutes only and that's it.
Ah? With?
No, is that talking with Antonia
I mean, now you have half an hour. Ah okay
Yes, they are, look, you know how much I paid on my phone bill this month?
Yes.
Two hundred dollars and I'm going to pay this month another two hundred dollars because I've talked too much.
Because uses like that
Ah.
on one hand, I think that yes, you would spend Christmas over there in the house and you come spending Christmas which is the week after like the, like the twenty seventh perhaps
I would arrive on the twenty seventh.
Yes, twenty sixth or twenty seventh, aha.
Well, to return, when do you return?
I - I return on the seventh, the seventh of January.
Yes, well. I would return with you the seventh
Yes, well, you I mean, you could come by here to the university or would fly back to Guatemala
Ah no,directly, directly, directly, yes.
Well, but if you can, we can leave the same day so that for them it's just one trip to the airport.
Aha, aha, yes well.
It would be, they were very happy and all, so how nice, your mom is in such good spirits because you are coming, I told them that it was because you had found a special package with a special ticket
Aha, Well yes.
that for, that you wanted to go see me and all that then they said that yes, that great and that yes I mean that yes, that it was going to be cold, that if you could tolerate the cold that it was perfect
In other words I have to take a lot of clothes.
I mean, yes they have over there also she says, I mean, no, but that it's going to be cold, they say it's going to be cold although they say this winter it's not programmed to be as cold as previous ones.
Ah, well, then I'm going to plan for the twenty seventh, girl.
For the twenty seventh, is that, it's Tuesday, yes okay, aha.
Twenty sixth or twenty seventh, yes, aha.
twenty six or twenty seven, that's what a ticket cost, how much
Look, I don't have it now and I'd loose sometime trying to go look for it
Yes, aha, yes, yes, yes.
I have it in my mind because they calculate it in dollars and they convert it to Quetzales so they give you several prices and they told me to go through Little Rock but I then decided against it.
Yes, well, yes, well, because otherwise, I could try to find out which airlines operate here and I could try to buy it and send it to you.
Oh, no, lets do that here, and the next time we can connect better.
Well, okay, that's fine, aha.
Oh yes, fine
It would be like, look, you come here on the twenty seven and it'd be like two weeks
Sure, yes, yes.
Right? You can take two weeks, twenty six or twenty seven is okay then.
Look, it's okay baby.
Yes, mom, thanks, it's okay. I now have a day off here

Ah, okay.

Ah, fine, yes, well.
Last weekend we went to Antigua and we came today in the afternoon around a half past four.
Yes, well, ah good, yes well.
Yes, here the situation in Guatemala continues, it is bad as always but it seems it is going  a little bit better.
It is --
Monday tomorrow a mission from the United Nations will start to verify the human rights, so this will improve the situation of the country in general.
Ah, good.  That's good.
In a --
Yes, almost no news from there comes over here.
Well it's better, because they aren't good.
Yes, well, yes.
In general, you know how it is here, but it's getting a little better.
And the situation of the buses is better.
Ah yeah, yeah, normal, it's all working and well, I think that this will be fixed in the coming year, ah --
Yes, well, that's good.  And so -- and how's it going with the running, good?

Ah. Ah Juan, to tell him.
Hello, Maria.
Hello, who's speaking.
How are you.
Juan how are you. Fine, fine
good, good, how are you and what a pleasure to hear you, how nice that you've called.
Yes, is that I have a free call of thirty minutes .
Yes I already heard, I was hearing the whole conversation, don't be embarrassed, I already found out almost everything, I'm not going to ask you much, what I did want to know
Ah, well.
of the Nosas, it's important that you get with it to make the Nosas see that it's good that my mom is over there, the only thing I wasn't like hearing too well is the date of the twenty seven, look that my mom spends Christmas is not a shame , but rather if it were up to us she would leave before to help Jean with the wedding and all that
No, because the wedding is the sixteenth, they told me
Well, and my mom can leave the sixteenth she says.
Mm, mm
Tell that to Jean so she takes it into account, if my mom also it's not embarrassed to arrive after to stay here with us, that's not embarrassing, for us it's better that she spends more time over there so like that she can see the season before Christmas, how everything because after Christmas you know that gets awful and ugly so
Yes, aha, yes it's true, yes.
Aha and then it would be good for her to accompany the Nosas for Christmas and that my mom is with you there.
Mm.
Because my dad is going to be here with us, anyway.
Yes well, yes.
You understand me already?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, that's good.
Ah then, talk to Jean about that, to see what she says, and about the room in which to stay, look, there in their apartment they have an extra bed, so, there's no headache and
No, it's better to ask, ¿which one of them?
In the newspaper, of course. You wouldn't let anything go there
The one who gives you more income
Sure, but the one that most... no, it's not true
Oh, dear Chopi, ¿what?
Uh, i spoke to you buddy Max
Oh, ¿yeah?, ¿what did he say?
Nothing
He's got some luck... i looked for him at his house, at Gina's , i was looking for him
But they left for Ina's Estate on the weekend
Yes, i was trying to call them there, but it was impossible
Uh huh
Anyway, i couldn't get them, the phone was broken, i called him at his house again and he wasn't there, so i said, ok, enough, he's older now
Uh huh
Hey, Chopi, one other thing, ¿don't you, don't you want anything from here?
No
If you think of something, let me now
Just a gringo [an american]
¡Chopi!
Kidding
Malonda, good.
Well, they're a joke, you know that I hate them.  And what's more, they're being expelled from California --
Eh, well, the Mexicans?
Yes, you didn't know?
Not really, the one hundred and thirty seven.
No, but, yeah.
No, it's not exactly this, what happens is --
Yeah, I no it's not, but not services --
Yes, besides, no, no, there's something else from the scrub, this --
And this is discrimination
change the teachers --
into spies --
in, into spies, and what I say, what scum --
but I've read a lot in the newspaper that many teachers say that they won't be anyone's spies --
No.
and the doctors say that as an ethical professional, they can't not treat someone.
In fact, in fact it's contradictory that a doctor, like, you get sick --
they legally treat you.
you go into an emergency state and they have to, they have to --
Treat you fully.
treat. If they don't treat you it is a crime
I know, that law is unconstitutional --
It is un- yes, yes
What this guy wanted was to be reelected, afterwards I don't think it shall never be put into practice
Yes, no --
But, poor band, oh, because I wouldn't either, honestly, I wouldn't want them here in Mexico either --
Who?
Poor band, you know, the --
Oh, the ones who don't belong here or there
Nobody wants them and honestly, if you consider it objectively, it is an undesirable race
Right Chopi
Enrique, they are not, they are vandals, they don't spaek either English or Spanish
But more or less, eh --
Los Angeles is disgusting, Enrique
But, Chopi, mm, look, alright, Chopi, Chopi, Chopi, Cho-
Dad, let me tell you, they have a lot to loose, wait, in California they have a lot to loose because, because if they leave they will run out of labor force and workers, right?
Yes
they are poor, they are vandals, but they work and it is over half of the people in California working there
Yes well, here in Arizona there is also a --
There is a --
It's quite thick, well
I mean, no, i mean, i don't want to be, uh, to turn you down, but that's, that's the reality, if we're racist among ourselves, ¿why would we be surprised when we go somewhere else and they don't want us?
Well, anyways
Or ¿do you love them?, Enrique, ¿do you love them?
¿Huh?
You're the biggest racist, so shut up, you're racist
I don't, shut up, i only think about it, i remind you this is being recorded
The idea amuses me a lot
Hey uh, hey, wait, one question, ¿what are your plans for Christmas?
Spend it at home
Huh, yeah it figures, besides, on vacation, ¿do you have vacation or not?
No, not at work
Don't screw with me, ¿seriously?, ¿and a few days?
Seriously, i even open on the twenty four at noon
Wow
yeah, id you don't open, and work, it doesn't pay up, son, it's finally selling like it should. ¿Why, what were you thinking?
Yeah, yeah, oh, well, to know if we could go somewhere
Oh man
My sister asked me why didn't i invited you go skiing in Denver, well, not Denver, but Vail, Colorado
Oh, uh huh
I told it with my pleasure, but, let's see what Sofia wants.
Hmm.  Aye man, how dramatic.  Look, I'm really sick with the flu.
My Chopi's sick.
Yes, no, really, well you think that I'll tell you that I'm going to spend the summer with you, do you know what they'll say to me?
Yes, I know
Eh, that if, sure, that then in a second, since I don't have a cent, they'll give me the paychecks, they'll start sending me money, since I owe money.
Seriously?
Aye, I swear.  I haven't finished paying the Guanajuato trip.
Hey, but anyways, well, if we don't go, if we don't go anywhere, we can do it, no?  Don't you figure?
Well, I don't know Enrique, I don't know.
I say for Christmas, I say, I agree that they have stores, but anyway --
I'm going to go to Tulancingo for a few days, because I'm going to spend New Year's there.
Hmm.
With my parents and my sister.
With your parents and your pisternas?
Hmm, yes.
Hey, so, you're able to get there.
What?
That you're able to get there.
Yes, but, well I don't know, I don't know what will be my destiny, my uncertain destiny.
Yikes, I don't know, we have to, told everyone that we went to Puerto Vallarta, but this isn't very clear.
Ah, well, I doubt it, firstly, like, I have to work, then, well, no, first I won't have a lot of money, let's say.
Well, so --
so I have to, I'm thinking about doing something to save, son, because I'm not going to spend my whole life like this, so, well, then my sister will come here and then I'll go with you --
Well, some days.
and you, and besides I told you that my future is uncertain, man, what you're doing, yes.
Your future is uncertain?  In what sense?
Aye, don't joke.  It's uncertain.
Yes, everyone's is I think.
Yes, but well, I'm referring to me, it's really uncertain.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I hope not.  Sometimes I don't know if you understand everything I mean, and it's a desperation --
No, this is why I want us to talk.
It's, it's a desperation, no, but I think it's better when you come, no?
Yes, yes, of course.
Because it's a desperation, I hope that you answer something for me, you wait for me to answer another and --
Yes.
we understand each other, no, and on the phone it's pretty annoying.
No, not on the telephone, it doesn't work --
Well, yes, it works, but not how it should, no?
Or, at least if it does work, it usually works but it's at a high price
Sure, pricey
and, oh, Chopi.
Yes, so-
Mmm, so, I think I'll have to kidnap you for at least a weekend.
Oh, you are nuts!
I am but it doesn't matter.
Oh yes, it doesn't matter.
I'm going to kidnap you.
Oh Enrique, this life, this life.
Oh.
Oh, you stay like that.
Well, believe that this time I won't remain silent as I used to do when I was in Mexico.
Mmm, but, oh, the only thing I was missing was for you to call me and be quiet.
No, no, no.
The only, that's the only thing I was missing. I talked to Hector, no, I haven't seen his friends, I never do now, never.
What did Marquez say, oh, I ask.
Why, how was he, so, he started telling me stories, yiak! That he wasn't before, that he used to be a child and that he now wants a serious relationship, like a man, and I was like
please explain that to me, and I can stay, and lets go
What, that was what Julio said or
and I, and I -- no, it's just that we were quite philosophical, right? and I went 'come on, tell me' and he told me 'no, I can't because my mammy is there'
'I'll tell you later', and I, alright. Well, he asked me, he made questions about you, I have told him what --
Mmm
you knew, right? then he tells me, 'no, they are just kids in this love affairs', he was a bout to continue
Oh, mark, in a while you'll come up with another lover, mm --
Listen --
Eh, sorry, sorry, no, it's Mark Luna.  Mark Luna the -- No, there are more than two lovers at the same time, eh?
and yeah, right now I think that it's all really calm, eh, but what never happened, that you only know when you feel it, and you know, a locked stream and so, it's good, mark, because the man laughed at me, no?
but well, it's the same as always.  The same, Hector, but I tell you, I don't see them, because Hector, well I'll talk to you and he never calls me, so I won't go running after people either --
No, sure.
If they don't want, if they don't want to see you or can't see you, pssssh, -- That --
Hey, Chopi, do me a big favor, no?  Look, so, tell, tell, talk with Marqui's wife and tell her that's she's, well, no, to the bitch --
She knows what you called her, eh?
Eh, well, then screw it.
She told her, because I called her --
Hmm, ah, okay.
on Saturday and then I talked with Hector and he told me that he talked with Enrique and that you talked with him.
Well, we'll see after, well what I need to do is agree with Juan to see if we can, because --
What for?
everything, well Fernando wrote me from Paris, what?
Ah your guitar, no?  Your guitar, no?
Ah, he will send it down here.
Aha.
And so, I'll bring it to you.  I'll also bring you a program from Daniel's mom.
Ah, great.
Eh, my Chopi.
Eh, is not, aha

Yes, they come out to one thousand three hundred quetzal with what it charges the, what is this company called

Ah, okay

Six hundred
No, one thousand one hundred and some.
Ah, okay. Aha.
Plus another twenty three dollars that
That they charge

Mm, ah okay.

Of, we'll see to it that it's on Monday and they are working days all.

Yes, true.
Yes, but how do I guess when you are there or are not, well but --
Yes, man, there, there at Angelica's house I was, aha.
Yes, but it doesn't matter, the thing is that you don't have any problems, ah.
Mm, no.
Ah, well. Look, and you didn't go to Soloma, right?
Mm, tomorrow Cesar's girlfriend comes here to the house.
Ah, well, aha.
Mm, okay, we already made plans with her, we already spoke with her on the phone
Aha.
and it was already set that she's coming tomorrow to have lunch with us.
Okay, she's not going to take Cesar's things, right.
Ah, she's only bringing information about everything from over there. Aha
Ah, well, but she at least is handling it. Look, look
Aha.
aside from this half hour, I have another half hour
Aha.

Ah, it's better not to use it in case we have things to tell each other, right.
Ah, well, aha, I'll use it later.
Later, oh, oh, you use it later, aha.
Okay, look, another
Auri, Auri came today.
¿He/she came?, oh, yes, ¿and what?

She was there with Marlon running errands on her car
Yeah
Right
Look, I'm eager to get you the TV

Soon, look, i wanted to give you the date, it's on the sixteen, sixteen
Right, the sixteen
of December, right
Right, december, ok. Thank god you're coming, yeah
Yeah, man, oh, i need to, i have a week now, I'm on a holiday week this week, if not
Right, oh, well, ¿and how have you been since you left here?
Well, fine, I've been fine
¿Have you felt well?, ¿have you been in good health?
Yeah, healthy, right -
Right
Perfect, I haven't had anything.
Aha.
Oh,
Oh, did you get the letters.
No, you always say that but I'm sure you haven't sent any, I haven't gotten any
Fine, you haven't gotten any of our letters?
None since I arrived here.
Wow, since you got there, but did get your message, the one you sent.
Yes. The fax, right?
The fax, aha, and
Yes, that's quick, it is.
Aha. Look, by the way
Aha
lets say that if I wanted to send you a fax
Aha
can I do that?
Yes you can, aha, yes you can.
Is it expensive?
No, it costs around ten quetzales, I suppose.
That's better because you get it that same day, right away.
In that same moment, even Santos, Santos might give it to you, I think.
Aha, so
Yes, I just have to send you the fax number because it's different
Aha, you can't give me that one, you can't give me that one  now, right
I don't have it right now, but I'll give it you on Monday, on Monday.
Oh, okay, mmm.
It's because I'm not even in the U right now, I'm still in the apartment that I was borrowed.
Aha.
because the U is closed, it's a holiday.
Yes, it's true, mmm.
Yes. And, how have you been?
Well, look, we are trying, really, asking God to give us spiritual strength because we do need it.
Mmm, aha, yes.
That was tough, so tough for us
Yes.
it was very, very tough and only God can give us the strength that we need, that we need to move forward because, it was really,
Mmm.
do you remember what we used to say to Cesar
Yes.
all those things we talked about and because of him, we have to do it for him. Mmm.
Exactly.  Eh, me too, because being alone, it's nice to be in the United States, but --
Aha.
but being alone, you also want your --
you're right, you have a lot of --
yes, it's hard too because I can't find refuge with my family because I'm here alone, right?
you're right, but --
I come to my room alone and everything, but --
yes, well, I've thought a lot about you --
Hmm.
so, right, about, hmmm ---
Yes.
eh, it's when we need to be together the most --
Yes, therefore it's --
and I thought about you, that here, well, eh, with sadness and, all the times that we build ourselves up spiritually, and times that we cry, too, --
Yes.
but, but being together and feeling less, we'll go on, because we're together --
Ah, yes.
and we think about you, and it's true that here there's a lot of people who can help you spiritually --
Aha.
and give you spiritual support and advice, right? --
Yes
but it's not like being with your own family
It's not the same. Mom, ¿what was i gonna tell you?, you see, if dad sends me that money, I'll send you a video recorder too
oh, that's good
Yeah, but don't say anything to my father, so he won't
No, well
right, because i know how i do my math and calculations, but, but
Oh, well, it's ok, oh, well. Your dad is going to talk to you now and he's gonna say goodbye already
Well, OK then
Yeah, it's just that it's very cold here
Right, here also
and we have to go to
¿To what?
To Soloma, and they say it's really cold there
¿When?
That i can't even find what to... we're leaving on the fifth
Right, and you return
on December fifth, because I'll finish vacation courses here
Yes
But they say it's really cold there because you have to go through the Cuchumatanes
Aha.
Worse than Cherla.
Worse than Cherla.
Worse than Cherla and to me the cold kills me, let's see what clothes I take over there. We have to be
Aha, yes, there you always go
Ah?
There you always go bundled up and all, ah.
Ah, a sweater, jacket, sheet, whatever because
Yes
it's three days, we have to be in Huenatenango, to not travel at night because it's dangerous
Aha, dad and no
arriving to no- right?
You are not going to stay very poor by sending me that money, right?
Well, regular, but that there's here, that, they even out the carts, right?
Wow, well, look, yes at the last minute, you feel that you are staying too poor, just send me a thousand quetzals and I'll see what I do.
Ah, no, better at once to fix it, because here you can get it.
Okay, okay, that's good.
I mean that
Look and how's that of the lending going, that's taking long, right?
Yes taking long but that would be for example if I take some money from other payments I had to make, but there's the comfort of that, right? even if it takes long, but it is really.
Aha, yes, aha, aha, yes.
Of the insurance is not sure, nothing can be sure.
Ah, okay.
Because, the insurance companies put excuses and
And, yes I understand, yes, aha
Now the other thing, it is, even if it's little
Ah, well.
and that would help us to kind of even out because let's say that the tickets are going to be from the Christmas bonus, practically.
Aha, ah, well, yes.
Then from there we normally even if it's poorly, the important thing is to be together, I mean eating a tamale here, like always.
Aha, ah, yes, aha, well.
Yes, so that's the important thing, that you come, the ticket, Monday we are going with your mom, it's thirteen hundred quetzal, one thousand three hundred and something quetzal because
Dad and if you already have it, why don't you send it tomorrow
Tomorrow, look that I'm giving some vacation courses and Cesar's girlfriend is coming
Ah, well.
Or if you want I send it on Friday.
Friday is better, the later, the better.
My problem would be that it would be Saturday and Sunday there, no, I don't like it, man.
Ah, well, then Monday, the thing is to send it, then Monday.
Eh, Monday it goes like that the whole week is already secured-
We-
those companies I suppose I that they take about three days.
Ah, yes, yes, and here there are, I already went there to that company and there is here yes,
The Western I went yesterday, yesterday I went to find out. They made me the mmm --
Calculation and everything.
in quetzals and in dollars.
Aha, OK.
So I was going to take quetzals, one thousand one hundred and sixty seven quetzals plus twenty three dollars in quetzals are about thirteen hundred and a bit.
OK.
So that is for sure.
Mmm.
And you calm down because spiritually, as I tell you, God keeps giving you fortitude.
In the- yeah.
so she got there, she started saying stupid things, I raised my hand, then I her him, like, she threw a punch at me, you know.
Aye aye aye aye -
like it was something more or less, and the thing is, we started to talk, my girlfriend was there, she started to cry and the thing, the littlest problem that we got into here, man.
Yeah.
It's not that -
Yes.
I'm, I'm fed up with respect to her, but when she, no, I don't know, she's really sassy, I don't know -
Yeah.  Pucha, I really can't do anything from here, but eh-
Hmm.
I don't know, you'll have to, like, wait until things calm down, that's it.
Hmm, yes, and how are you.
There's nothing - fine.
Fine?
Everything's fine thanks - yes.
I know that you got your engineer.
Well, yes, I took an exam here and I- I have a certificate here but I still have to have another exam.
Yeah.
And maybe the one next year -
Yeah, is it really difficult?
Surely the next year, anyway.
Yeah, eh --
And, hmmm.
And how is Sarita.
Well, here all are fine, I, with the desire to go to Chile, nothing more, listen.
Yes? now?
Of course because I am still trying to find another job.
Yeah.
And I was not sure if I could travel if I found a new job.
Hmm.
I would not have a permit to, to travel, well.
Yeah.
But like this is better, I better go to -- surely if nothing happens this year --
Hmm.
eh, I am going to be able to go more or least in March.
Ah, in March, but anyway in this year you come.
Well, yes --
or the next year
for, for example, if I stay in this job until the first week, second, or the second week of December --
Hmm.
maybe I will have the chance to go in December, the third week or at the end of the year --
Yeah.
but I don't want to go at the end of the year, every time that I've gone to Chile it has been at the end of the year --
Sure, sure.
and it doesn't happen, I want to see how things are about work over there, well.
Sure.
so that --
Mmm. eh, Camilo, Juan, Juan was here in Chile recently, Juan Capelatti.
Yes, well. Yeah, I knew about it.
Eh, do you know that he got divorced --
Listen, but --
He got divorced and everything.
Yeah, and, there is --
And the --
and I don't know what's up --
and he --
there's more, well, we never found out what happened there or not.
Sure, no, there were problems, couple's problems, couple's problems it seems, and at the end they split --
Yeah.
the gringa, they went to court and she practically took everything away from him, the house that he bought, an acre that he had --
Ah
A couple pickup trucks and a bunch of stuff. He was here like a month ago
Hey, but the other question would be, I don't mean to pry, would be knowing what she's telling people
Sure, we'd have to know her version as well, sure, maybe
Maybe, we don't know exactly what happened
Sure, we never found out that
because maybe the other was, you know, beating around the bush
Yes, I think that Juan, looks like the gringa was seeing a gringo, and Juan was, this way, that way, until they couldn't keep going anymore
Well, yes, yes, we've been talking about very personal stuff, and this call is being recorded
Yes, it's sad that my dad wasn't here so he could have talked to him
Ah, yes, but uhm, what is he doing there in Iquique
They to see some machines with my mom, for the gym, those machines with weights, for body building
I see
And they're supposed to be cheaper in Iquique, because it's a tax-free area
Ah, okay
It's chea- things are cheaper, and they're doing that, and they're doing some other thi- actually I don't know what they're doing, they're with Pancho Bustos

There are around three thousand kilometers, three thousand and odd kilometers I think so.

But when you went to Brazil from Antofagasta you left, where did you arrived.
I, I do, I traveled by train, I did not went by train to Serena, in Serena I took a bus to Antofagasta and then I went to the, I cross the frontier --
To, in Antofagasta you crossed --
But, Iquique, ¿huh?

Yes
not study like this, the university is very good and people too --
Ah
post grade is different I guess, but English is quite fine, I mean, of course I have a lot to learn, but I think you learn the language better when you live, work or study in the university, with the teachers, I mean, taking your studies --
but, of course, I could study, I need to study more english, what I know is not enough, I still need to study more, but at least I am quite fed up of being here studying English
Yes
Yes, I have talked to the office several times, there they are, well --
Aha
snowed under with work, Antenor didn't call you?, she was going to call you one of these days
No, she didn't call me
She was going to call you because she says Mario called to ask about the tablecloth and he told him 'I don't have it', 'no, you must have brought it', 'no, I don't have it'
He called me, 'look, what tablecloth is you mother talking about?', because he knew we were looking for one we couldn't find, 'are you sure? because you mother, because you told her you had sent it, since you are half crazy', 'no, I didn't tell her' --
Aha

And what he's studying now?
Eh.
But, what is this exactly.
Eh, a master
No, but what he's studying now in Philadelphia, these months that he's spent there
It's also, I mean, it's the same.
It's the continuation.
Is that it's combined, yes but, it's like a title that has two names, understand? one that Philadelphia gives him, the University of Philadelphia, and another that the French Institute of Petroleum, in Paris.
Ah.
But it's a combination between a university of Paris and this one.
Ah, okay.
A combined study. Understand?
Ah, okay.
Like, but it's the same then, you see?
Ah yeah, Look, Li-
And well, but he's really nervous, no, it's crazy.
But how is it working out?
Well, no, fine, but what happens is that, sure, you know that here the grade is, like, the joke is to get twelve, you know?  So sure, he got --
He got good grades.
He got about sixteen on his tests --
Ah.
so he says that for him, it's not a very good grade, you know? --
Ah.
like he's frantic, he's frantic, he's frantic.  And he had time without studying, so --
Sure.
and everyone he's studying with are ducklings who recently arrived at university and are better than him now --
Ah.
you see?  So he's been really nervous, poor thing, it really makes me, hmm?  huh?
Poor thing, studying like crazy.
Frantic, frantic, no and nervous, you know that we bought the car and since it's him who charged everything -- Nissan Altima.
What car did you buy, how is it?
U, like, it's written Ultima.
And how is it?
Beautiful, beautiful the car.
Right?
Great, yes, yes, yes, very nice, I mean --
And how much it was, how much did it cost in Bolivars.
I don't now well, but it must be like, like two million and a bit.
More or less. Ah, but well, it must be good, no?
Yes, no, no, it's that it's a car, and the year ninety four, new.
Listen, Irma, and wasn't it that they were going to buy another one.
Yes, yes black, but you know what happens, remember that the car we have to leave in the United States --
Aha.
and then where do we leave it paying for parking and paying for insurance --
Ah.
for a year, do you understand? because this one we're going to leave with Dave's friend --
But you have to insure it.
Well, black, it's a risk, you know what it would be for you to loose that car.
No, but I mean if you left it parked.
No, no, but anyway, here, here those things can never be risked --
That's mandatory.
Practically.
Ah.
You know?  So look, no, you know what it is that you're investing in and after they steal this for bad luck --
Yes, yes, it's true.
you know?  so look, no, it won't be, we won't be able to --
I say get a used one, Irma.
No, it's not about money, it's not for the money, it's for, it's for the problem it implies, that Dave doesn't have money, honey, and this requires a lot of effort --
Ah, aha, aha.
Look, to buy this car, Dave had to go to take an exam like an hour form here, a written exam, after a month he could take the, the practical --
Ah.
They scraped the practice for, well, for those assholes, but you know, no?  Here they don't forgive anyone --
Aha, yes.
and after he had to take another that was about an hour, and he's there every day, so I can't do anything --
Sure, yes, well.
you know?  So it's a mess, because I can go to an insurance company and I can't go to buy it because I still don't --
Yeah.
I'm not able to do it, you know?
Yes, it's true.
and he doesn't have time, he says that suddenly if we stay here for longer, he'll do it, but, too much headache, you have to deal with the apartment stuff, everything, everything --
Yes, true.  And the
The only thing I can do is shopping. ] It's the only thing I do.
Look, sweetie, and you still haven't gotten the apartment in Paris?
No, if we go to look for it, this is why he decided to not go, because we have to go to look for an apartment there and we only have ten days to look.
Ah, but they have it
No, not from here.  No, well, you know that Paris is complicated, it's not like here.
But he doesn't have family, family there.
He has a cousin there, he already called her, a cousin --
Aha, aha.
she's in Paris, a far cousin, who he almost doesn't know --
, aha.
and well, he called her to see, but you know that there it's not as practical as here, it's the same as real estate and the first job --
Ah.
but you know, it's difficult to get an apartment in Paris because Paris is big, you know? --
Ah, yes.
even if it has a center and everything, no?
Aha.
but in any case, it isn't easy, then.
Not so easy, no.
exactly and then, well, he has to, well, we have to go and look for an apartment, you know?
Ah, look Iris, how are you in English?
No, well, what happens is I don't practice a lot, only in class because after, well I watch television, but not a lot --
Aha.
But well, no, i kinda understand, but i speak it terribly, i speak
Oh, because you need, it's about practice
No, it's just i came blank, black, that's what i was telling
That's what i mean, you're like me when i started the English course, right
when you started, yeah, if i came the way you're now
Right, oh, yeas, of course
Uh, i could take much more advantage of it, ¿you know?, that's mainly what i was telling Coni, it's a shame that this course is so expensive
Right
¿Right?, i didn't come here with a little more
A little bit of knowledge
of knowledge, ¿you know what i mean?
Of practice, practice
No, knowledge, at leas grammar, the one you did
Right
I would come here and i would take great advantage of this four months
Yes, yes
¿Do you understand?, but no, i, besides, i hadn't even spoken it for eight years
Yes
So, well, well, then
But it's something then, right, you already know structures
Yes, no, structures and, you know that the most important thing is that you understand and can speak --
Yes.
before the structures, at least, for jobs and that -- Sure, it's his, his, his, if you can't come here, it doesn't matter, but the good thing is to take advantage of the ear, do you understand?
The ear, the practice of speaking.
Exactly, the practice, so I want anyway to go to Paris, continue, no? but well, we'll see, no?
Sure. You can continue in Paris?
Well, yes, look for another course, you understand?
Ah.
But the one that they pay for is French.
Ah.
They don't pay for English.
But and you do the one in French.
I have to do it.
Ah, OK.
Because it's the only one that they pay for and because I need it.
Sure, sure, and no --
Because English at least you know what is house, what is pencil, what is food, but there, nothing.
No, and English is easier. Yes.
So, no, no, it's difficult well, good, but no, here we're fine, here we're fine, the only thing co- that, that I'm very nervous about is because of Dave, well, you understand?
Ah.
I mean that when he's nervous, he transmits the distress. You remember the party, right?
Mm, yes.
ah, well, the same, but everyday, and even though I go to sleep at three in the morning every day, so he studies
Really?
so that yes, we have dinner at two in the morning - like that every day. The other day he arrived at five thirty in the morning
we went to sleep at that time, I mean that -- he's, poor guy, is that studying is very tough, more here, studying in English.
Listen, English.
And yes, then
But you hear it, and in the recorder when I called the other time
Mm.
Okay, he speaks English awesome
No, no, is that he speaks much better than his postgraduate friends.
Yes, true
But what happens is that no, see, he never studied here.
Yes.
But it's the continuity of the English courses there.
AH.
Understand? because he had never studied here, not even a month.
Yes.
And he speaks perfectly, I mean, he can communicate easily, yes.
Listen yes, I stayed crazy -- yes, in the recorder, yes, sincerely that
Yes, no, no, yes, he doesn't, yes he communicates fast, but well
Yes, the bad things are the classes and the jokes.
Ah, and that I haven't been able to and that
Perhaps they are other words
and, and we haven't been able to enjoy anything, girl
Really?
Because the thing, I mean because -- I thought, I go to New York, that time that I went
To New York?
but that I don't like it either because - alone in train, he tells me there's no problem, but I'm scared, you understand?
Ah.
but, but we haven't been able to take advantage of the car, I mean, if we could go to Washington, we could go to Boston, we could go to so many places with the car
Sure
but we can't, well, because he doesn't have time
Ah,
that, we went to Atlantic City, that I remembered Ricardo
Why
Is that he, I think, that when I have money, the gift I'm going to give Rickity
Ah
ah, because it's pure casinos
Oh, go figure
It's a city of casinos, of casinos, of casinos
Right
But beautiful, ¿right?, and i said, Lii, Ricardo would be happy, ¿right?, I'm gonna give him one million bolivars, and the trip, for him to spend one million bolivars
Yeah, because we played one real for five minutes and they quickly kicked us out of the game
¿Right?
Yeah, awful, i mean, we gout out of there really fast, uh, no, nothing, watching people play, people with money
Look at that, and how's people there
It's ok, i have a girl friend now, you know i didn't had any girl friends until now
Right
But now i have a sister, a blood sister, Brazilian
Oh, and what, remember that Brazilian girls are
No, but she's married
But
She's, she'ts married and all, ¿huh?
She's not messy anyways
A little, a little, i mean, she's like me, you know
Oh
She's very much like me, besides, she speaks plenty of Spanish
Oh
So, well, she doesn't, but she's very funny, very funny
And what is she doing there
She, her husband is doing a major
Right

Oh, yeah
She says that I'm dead, and no, i don't even buy gum
And she, she

Yes, there where you live in the house of Meriquin.

And why that dumb ass gave me that telephone.
Because Americo is beside us and you can call us there --
There in Chiquilina´s place don´t, there is not telephone --

Ah, Hmm.

Hmmm.
Because there aren't nice houses, and so then - for June they already promised me a house that was already rented, you see, so -

Yes, that's good.
Thank God.
Good.
My queen, and how is whe.
Here you'll talk to her now, and I will get Cheche too.
And well, and, and Santi --
And tomorrow, and tomorrow or the next day I will send you a package.
Mmm.
I will send a perfume to Cristina and I'm sending one to you too.
what for my daughter!
And-
Not yet, no-
And the cards and stuff like that, okay
Well, I haven't written anything yet, I promised to because gordo had been sick, I don't know if Christina told you about it
No, she didn't. What happened to him?
He was, well he was only able to take two courses, no, not anymore
Everything was delayed.
No, no, he did some test, I will take him tomorrow with the
And what's going to happen with him?
and I'm sure, I'll know what will happen to him tomorrow, I'm sure they'll double the
Loo Carlos, it's a bad intention, they think gordo has delayed everything
No, no, no, the only course that he postponed is Math, that was the first one that he presented and he got a three, which is excellent news, it is, and then in the other classes he got a four, three and four, so
And what was he sick of, Maribi?
well, I don't know, we had twenty two days full of anguish, and you know, he's colon is double the size as everyone else, it is, you know, I think I have that too, oh well
Just like Pilincho. Poor man, he has a very long colon.
Yes, the colon, and you know what Estela? He is in terrible pain.
Really?
He has to take care of himself so that he doesn't get sick and and in a corner of it you can see it's about three fingers, if he doesn't take care of that he'll get diverticulitis
and he's going to be in pain because of that, it's dangerous
So Maribi, how is it, that's old people's illness.
Of course, it might take him, now he doesn't have, he's got three small calluses.
They don't understand what we speak and they say, comment on.
That, he's got three small calluses to begin with, and if he doesn't follow his diet he may get diverticula, because you get diverticula as a result of poor nutrition, for that reason it's --
Wow.
and what he may also have is an intestinal obstruction, as one grows old, I'm telling you --
Poor thing. And what will you do about school Maribi?
So what, he must take care from now on. No, father director, teachers, everyone, because it wasn't known Estela, one wanted to operate, one to
So why didn't you tell us.
How could I tell you if here everything was distressing, checks in checks, a thousand things were made to him.
And now they won't operate on him.
Tell me that I've got insurance. No, now it is not operable. With the years let's see if he's got --
Yeah, one of the idiots was going to be doing research with the baby, again.
Yes, and he's a really good gastroenterologist, he's incredible, and now he'll be seen by doctor Rufino Gorostiaga, the professor --
Ah.
Gorostiaga is the one to give him his diet for life, he will control --
Mmm, mmm.
and doctor Samanio is the surgeon, he's the one who will also always control him and wants me to take him, probably he's going to need a neurologist because he is very nervous and nerves made him, his nerves made ​​it manifest that problem in the colon.
All nervous people, immediately, colon is what they suffer, say, the first thing to suffer is the colon, moreover in his case, he somatized his his illness, you understand? Yes, psychosomatic, due to the psyche, yes.
Mmm, poor one, my lenle. I called him yesterday and he was putting up his little tree.
Yes, I was, so that I'd put, they wanted, that I was not going to take part as we were leaving, but oh, I don't know when are we leaving, I don't have a house yet so I told them that I can't anymore, that's all.
Poor, my little bird.
He already put it, he is divine, he planted a beautiful tree, it's beautiful with my fat one.
I, oh, that's crazy, you didn't tell me about that.
Yes, it was wrong, all those pains, high fever.
And what did the father say, are they still doing some tests?
No, he probably doesn't know but it seems that they are going to double the note because he has good grades, do you understand?
Oh. I hope Maribi.
And, luckily the only course that he had to delay was Math, there was no way, the first one he did do the test and got a good grade, it's three, do you understand, yes.
Three is excellent, don't you see that the top grade is now five, sure.
Up to five, that's all, but to get a three is like saying
Sure, yes, sure.
It's excellent, it really is because they usually delay it and then you get, and he barely missed half a point to get a four on Math, so, you understand.
Mmm
Oh, so the last time, he was sick and he still had to take the computers' test but the father got mad and he told him that he shouldn't have done that and he annulledh the test.
Oh, is that so?
No, no, no, this guy is sick, he can't take a test. Lets annul the exam, as he had not taken it
Mmm. Mmm
so he couldn't take it. Estela.
Poor baby, well, let me put Cheche in the line and then mom, Maribi because the time is almost up.
Eh, and, well, well my doll
