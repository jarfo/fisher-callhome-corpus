Aha.
there's the same little problem too.
Aha.
But, it turns out that, am, at home, the church we go to,
Aha.
eh, well, we talk and everything, and we reached the conclusion
Aha.
that in that respect, women are pretty. No? And, they need to do themselves up, because they are not going to be like that all the time.
Aha, aha. Naturally, aha, aha, aha, aha.
Exactly. So, in that respect,
Aha.
Yes, there are, there are people that are very bothered. Then, they look at the other person as less than the others.
Aha, aha, aha, aha.
And, they look at you like in a strange way. But, I don't pay attention to it, because, and more my- my sisters, I have two sisters,
Aha.
and they dress very nicely, and they're young, and one has to dress nicely.
Aha. Aha. Aha.
So no, yeah, but there are people that get really bothered.
Right, right.
Sometimes they don't say hi to you.
Yes
Or, but no, but yes. They have their own way of thinking, and sometimes, they are really stubborn.
Right.
Like this, "because no, that's not the way it is, it is the way is say it is"
Right.
But, well, you have to...
But, also on Catholic school too. I remember, when my children were little
Yes

Right
And we were waiting for the first, the first, to come out, the first one to go was for the American people
Right.
We were waiting, and behind me, there was an Hispanic lady.

too colorful for the Church, that her shoes were too high, that she had a lot of make up, that she seemed like a
Yes
like she was going to a party, that she wasn't properly dressed for Church.
yes.yes
And, I looked at her, and I told her,
yes
How will she be talking if she adores God.
Clearly. And one should go beautiful because if, if someone fixes them self up to go to a party, it's true that,
yes. yes
that has nothing to do with God, or anything of that. Ah, when someone goes to church, they have to go very well put together.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
being fixed.
And you should not talk about your neighbor if you are going to church.

I suppose you do not talk about your neighbor.
Exactly, yes.
But, she was, and I looked and her and said, wow, my God, she is talking like that, How can this be?

So, We are on that over here.  I am

Aha, aha, aha.  But no, in, in our countries it is not the same as here
Hmm
Over there there is a lot of poverty and there is no work

My mom went to Puerto Rico, After.
Mhm.
And my little brothers went to Puerto Rico. Then, I stayed here and, as I got married, I stayed here
yes. Aha.
But, my mom was coming and going. But my mom disliked being here due the cold
yes, eh, yes i heard that it's cold in Chicago
Why not, and she says that, that, what is worth that i stay in here between these four walls, in Puerto Rico she can get out of the house

It's not the same
Right, ay what, and then your mother is in Puerto Rico now ?
In Puerto Rico, yep, yep
Nice, indeed
But my mother is catholic, and my aunt too

done things, am, holes in her ears to put some earrings,
Mhm
shaved her legs, she was wearing pants, suits too

And, my grandmother and father don't like that
Mm. Oh.
because he says that women should not wear pants
yes.
for, in your religion
It is, he is the brother of his
of my mom
mom, really?
He says that, women should not wear pants because the pants are made ​​for men.
Mm. yes. yes.
But my uncle is very uh, as it is? labored to religion.

So if that does not tell their children they get to religion.
Mhm.
Only it is, my mom, sisters, their nieces, nephews. But the kids do not say anything
Ah. Mm. Mhm.
So, am, so, ah, I tell you that that, to believe in God, must be seven days a week at church.

But, this seven days a week at church.

He is here, on, on Saturday, he says he goes to church since early in the morning.
Mhm
until night time and on Sunday the whole day at church.
Wow.
So then, he is very church fanatic.
yes, yes, Mrs.
I have a friend, she is Christian, and she only, she says she goes to church
Mhm, yes.

Of course.
But, mu uncle goes seven days a week.
Oh, really.
And, and he is always talking about our Heavenly Father, that our Heavenly Father here, our Heavenly Father there

Mm. Mhm.
Heavenly Father, we have Him with us twenty-four hours a day.
Of course.
Uh, Uh, I tell him, you do not have to go to talk to our Heavenly Father, because in your own bed, you can talk to Heavenly Father.
yes, ma'am
The only thing is that you can't be asking Daddy God and nothing else, what is it? don't think about God when you have problems, but all the time
Eh, it's, it's
because, some people
yes
Ay, God, please give me this, Ay God, please give me that, but when they're fine, with no problems
Hmm
then they don't remember Daddy God exists
Sure
Hello?
Hello, Milgred from Connecticut
Mercedes speaking, from Philadelphia.
How are you, good evening.
Mm, good evening too
Hm
Let's see what we talk about religion then
Do you believe that it unites, disunites, or?
Hm
Or do you think that if the whole world was of the same religion we'd be better or we would be the same or it would be ?
Mm, I think that, I, what I think is that, that the
a much better world?
someone being of the same religion that we are all of the same religion it's impossible, because I think that there will always be differences, eh, cultural
Aha, aha
And, that's going to make that every person interprets the, that one religion their own way. What do you think?
Yeah, yes, I think that is, it's the same, and like we wouldn't, we are not of the same race. So the, each race has its
its doctrine, their own, oh and, and even if we're Hispanic some acquire other that in, eh, sometimes are not, not even, I mean, sometimes some of us are from a Catholic family, and the other members of the family are
Adventists or are, um, of the evangelicals,
Hm mm
or they are of the of the other ones, of the taballas, the ones that sell, uh, oh, what do you call them, the th- I forgot their name
But, it's, i mean, they're a lot of, a lot, a lot, we're a lot of races and we're many religions.
Uh um.
But, um, i don't, other religions don't bother me. I share with any religion, as long as they don't try to, to get me into something i don't want, you understand.
Exactly, that don't get you
Yeah, that aren't fanatics. Right.
Or force you, that you don't feel forced, yes.
Yeah
That they talk to you, but, i mean, that if i believe in the, what is, uh, ¿what's it called?, um, the, that religions fall apart because of the same differences
well, what you believe in, the, differences always exist.
Yeah, religion is like politics.
Exactly.
Depending on, on what side you look at it from, well, not everyone is going to agree, you understand.
Uh um. That's why they say you should never argue about religion. Not because, not because of, i can't believe they have made us discuss religion on this program
Uh, um, yeah. But that's good, it's good to, to discuss everything, because really, if you realize, also my, my, i have aunts and cousins that belong to the evangelic religion
Uh um
And the rest of them are mostly catholics,
Uh um
And in the, uh, on the other side of the family, there are also some absentees
Uh um.
But when we get together, no one is talking about religion, no one is talking about, you know, that "you should be like this", and, "you have to change", nothing.
And my cousin's husband is evangelical, he almost always attends is in the church. And she does not belong to the church. And they have a really happy marriage.
And she, she doesn't, she only attends when there are special occasions, for example when the mothers celebrate a ceremony to the moms, when they have in, in
in which they more celebrate, because they do not celebrate Christmas, but they do other there, other occasions that
Who are them?
the evangelicals.
Okay
Okay, yes, the evangelicals. So my cousin's husband I say, is and was not evangelical, they get married in that religion, and after they get married, he joined the church, and she did not.
Hm
And she dances, and she drinks, and she never stops and he goes along with her to the work parties and everything, and he is there with her, and does not
I mean, he is not doing to the people, ah, you should stop smoking, you should stop drinking, should there is not any moment
yes they do jokes in the parties, so relaxed, she does not get  grumpy either, not anything, you know, of, of that thing, of this thing nothing, that you shouldn't say that thing, not, really happy.
Yes, I mean is the kind of people to whom everything depends on who who who, how, how the person found him, but if they get   obsessive, never mind.
What happened in my house is
that is
that, eh, my mom is evangelical.
Okay
And my dad doesn't, um, he really didn't go to the church. He never decided.
Okay, so in that way he is, right, like my cousin is.
And, But we everyone of us went to the catholic high school.
Oh yes?
Yes, it's like we never always had Christians, but
Yes
We had, you know, what we learned from school, at home we didn't reinforce those concepts
Yes
And now, I think that, from my sister, only the older one is  still catholic. The youngest I think is evangelic and I have decided myself to be without any religion at all
So, you don't go at church or similar
No
No?
No?
I go to church, but I not that of a nun
So, since I finished college I decided I would never go to a
to a church, I really don''t fell interesting an organized religion
I don't like it
No, exactly, I don't like it, and I don't really need the necessity to do so. I feel a have God in my heart
Yes
Yes, That's how I try to live my life. But, let's say that know that I'm married, my husband is Jewish, My son is also a Jewish, and we'll raise him like one
Yes
Because I think people needs to grow with a religion
I think it is a strong foundation, specially for children
Yes, definitively, I
Well, yes, you raise them, at least with, with something, forget it that they go, and, and are, I don't know, they, they get a little wild, kind
hm mm
they don't have like feeling. Or rather, they do not develop a feeling towards anything.
hm, mm, yes.
I understand, like they do not care about anything.
yes, yes, for this reason, I agree with that, yes, yes, is that, if children well. That's why they say
And, and, and you, you said you were Christian and that, and what a miracle that, uh, you were accepted by his family, seeing, that the Jewish almost always
yes?, yes, they are, really like that
they are, how do you say, are
yes, you were lucky.
only among them, they try, they try to marry, and so they can have the same religion.
yes, yes, it's true yes, oh, they of course, of course, they are very strict, right
yeah, ah
But no, my husband's family have always been very understanding. In fact their other son married, a girl that was also not
Jewish, and I think, I imagine that maybe that is why, I was the second one, it did not
But, did you get married as a Jewish or did you married as a Catholic?
No. We had a religion, a Jewish wedding.
Oh, how beautiful, oh yes, yeah
yes, and lest say, and then, is what I say, my son will be raise and say is important that he grows up in a religion
hm mm
When he is an adult he will decide what to do.
and that said aha
the truth is if he wants to follow or not.Religion in  itself is another thing to raise a child on.
The girl and the great one are baptized catholics but the small ones although not baptized in the Catholic church,  also visit the church.
evangelical churches
hmmmm
She goes with the husband of my cousin and she puts on her long skirt and they respect it.
it's religion to them and eh she is happy to go with them  and I never said no when they asked me if I can take her, I said ah yes.
you know
I don,t understand when my mom says she has to wear skirt when going to church.
Then I said because it is wrong to wear trousers
because I believe in the Bible it states that trousers is something for a man.
Yes but for me, that was one of them
it is related to
not moving away from the truth but a little bit from organized religion, and that the people takes the bible too strict
That is for those who become fanatics
ah yes.
They interpret and understand word for word what is written
hmmm
as the Iraqis with their crazy doctrine, that kills people in the name of...
of that God they have, or of the, or whatever they believe in.
Hm mm
That is that sometimes there are people that like they give it too much thought, it, it is distorted
Hm mm
interpreting what in truth must be something that should unite.  Because religion should unite, it don't matter which one it is.  It doesn't matter which one it is.  Understand.  I  don't think that, because a person a religion and another of another, then
have to, to kill each other.  For that, for that, for that belief
yes
So for me, like I am not not fanatic of anything, I , I, never become fanatic with anything.  I observe, I was raised in the Catholic religion,
and I helped in the church, and belonged to the to the club of the daughters of Mary, and I helped a lot in the church and all.  Those are
always has been my, my faith the, the catholicism, but no just, ehm, the, it did, like I would take my children to the church, and I baptized them because it, that is how I was raised.
But as adults, well if they want to go wherever they feel like it, I they go understand, it is not like they have to, that I have to tell them no, you can not visit that other church,
or, you can not believe in that, because Catholicism says that, that it is different.  You know
Hm mm
And the majority of this, of this, some people that are in the  gospel or in the Jehova witnesses and they even try to get things in through your eyes, and they want to come to your house to, to, early in the morning to come and sell every thing they can think of
And I well, sometimes they knock, and I tell them, well look thank you, I already have the little book, and if not I tell them well look, I am Catholic, and no
Ah, but is that there are people, that well, I understand them in that they
Are reckless
their job is conve- no their job, but they wish that people would convert to their religion, right.  But they don't respect either he no.
Aha, ah
Right.  Or, or that maybe on, well there are peo=
I had a lady who used to come, look, each time I went out the door, the woman came, with no, look, that you an help us with that, buy the book, you know that
that you are fishing, and what do I know, but it is that I have been a sinner since I was born my daughter.  So there the lord can reprimand me when she arrives I there, well
Eh, if they try to, I don't know, they tray to tell you such negative things, instead of telling you well look, you can know more about the lord, and what do I know, or something else
on the other hand, but that you are a sinner yes, yes, yes I continue sinning and now you are sinning talking like that,
Hi
Good evening, how are you? with Norma from here in Atlanta, Georgia. And were are you?
I am Arturo, I am in, I am in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.
oh, okay.
yes, nice to meet you. Where you from Norma?
I am from Peru.
From Peru, my, my, my roommate is from Peru
Oh, okay yes, there are many people from Peru here
for Lima, yes, also Mexicans
ah, are you Mexican
yes, I am Mexican
oh, okay
from the City of Mexico
mhm
very good. and in Georgia, what do you do, study or work?
no, I am, I take care of my children, I am homemaker.
Oh, okay, very good and he, your husband, is is, also from
Peru, no,no my husband is
yeah, form Peru, American
My husband is American, yes, yeah,
oh right, ah good
and then, what do you think about religion or religions ?
then i think it comes from medival times and that
aha
the religion was lost during institutionalization, what i mean by that is that religion wasn't left to be something  spiritual
mhm
and converted into something more political and lately in our times isn't such a political force but it giving headaches too
mhm
like institutions then, you can be religious and spiritual
mhm
but not necessarily institutionalized then you may not necessarily favor what church says or favors
a certain institution like the Jew, Catholic or the Muslim but then perhaps, like someone said, you can mix a little of the philosophies like
using them to take a good road in like more than anything
mhm
what do you think ?
right, in fact i am a religious person, i belong with a religion called Hare Krishna, i don't know if you heard about
ah yes, yes i heard something, i don't recall very well and don't know what Hare Krishna was about
mhm it's based in a Hindu philosophy
aha
then every one of us believes that we are part of God and we believe in reincarnation, we have laws and rules, we're vegetarians, we don't eat food, eggs and fish either
mm, we don't drink alcoholic beverages
And why don't you eat meat? why do you believe that..?
because we believe that every living entity deserves respect, to avoid violence against the other living entities
oh, I see
that's why we don't eat meat, or get intoxicated with drugs or alcohol
aha
we don't take coffee or tea
yes
and we don't play games of luck
any kind of games of luck
no. Are you religious? Do you belong to any religion?
no, I don't belong to any institution right now, I was born and grown up as a catholic, but right now, I am twentyone years old
since I was eighteen I haven't followed the indtitution because, I, I was not very interested in what they preached
I felt rather like my spirituality, my contact with
mhm
with this God didn't need to be through this institution, so I just decided to read a bit about other religions, but merely
to cultivate myself and to, let's say, get the right way through life, but
mhm
I am not a, I don't like institutions
oh, but you do believe in God
yes definetly, but no
oh that's very good, i mean there are many times that you can identify with a group of people, no
exactly
but its important that you have God in your heart, and you treat to develop a relationship with god, that's very important
yes, precisely you have tu reconize the true of that
mmm, a supreme being
a divinity behind everything no
sure
but i mean in base of that i had changed a lot, and studied too, i studied chemistry engineering, a lot of time as people of sciencie you tend to
we say broken the people religion or corrupt it
mmm yes
but i think all the contrary because the people begins to know of him, so i am very scientific, this things are very religious because
because they give realize that with that more you know and can explain
mmm
more questions you get and more you discover of this inexplicable world and there are miracle things in every place every time and this
i am sorry, each time the people knows more like scientifics and that people understand more must be a divine caos, a divinity behind everything
sure a supreme being that control everything that happen
yes
sure and the religion really, i mean the religion or believes that you have in that supreme being, join people because in the moment of dessasters, suffering, then you always
turn around and always you ask God for help, everybody in the world there are many people even they called atheas themselves, on the moment that they are despair always
they don't ask, they turn their faces like that to ask God for help
yes yes, yes, yes that is
no that is really one is the one that is really in their heart no, one feels that there really exists a supreme being only that many times don't
yes exactly one does not need to turn to religion to seek help, but also to say thanks
hmm sure hmm
I think that many times people then becomes religious on certain moments because they need help but when they already that they are fine, that is forgotten by them
yes ye that is why not, in the philosophy that we follow, there is always a ___ there is one, one verse that says, no, that when one is suffering
yes
one must always one must always seek help from God and that one should really ehm, should should ask God to send you suffering because in that way one remembers him more
because otherwise when one is find, on forgets about one's relationship with God
yes
in t- in that it is true no, because when one is doing fine, one is very happy
yes you then don't remember
no then one thinks that one is the one that controls things, not that one is the one that does the he is the one that controls all of the things that happen and of one so that is what does the deeds, no
yes yes, yes
no but really that is what is that God blesses one and helps you in many circumstances
yes, yes, yes, true
and And you have one, have a notion regarding reincarnation or something like that, regarding the law of karma have you heard anything, have you read?
well I have heard about karma no and like ehm like how karms is, is, is carried out, no that is if you had a bad karma you are going to reincarnate in another being but to
hmm
to improve, not to clean, not to have another opportunity, to have good karma, but not something so pure
If the law of karma is a law of action and reaction that one is rewarded accordingly, positive or negative activities do not also have a positive or negative reaction.
ah OK
Many things people say do not happen, although they are seen as good people, they are not really.
past lives that had negative actions are not having negative reactions and suffering
Yes
Not that there are no innocent people or no people who are very good, only a reaction has free will
You can not do what you want, God does not force you to believe in him, or obligate you to serve or perform devotional service.
yes
No one uses free will and does negative activities. There is often a reaction to the law of karma, if is infallible that no one is free from the law of karma.
yes
Mhm, that is what we think and not what we believe
Ah, I see the hare krishna
in our religion, yes
what have you done? Do you meet with the hare krisna weekly or daily?
Yes, that is I am now married and live here in an apartment near the temple.
aha
The temple here in Georgia, in Atlanta, but before I lived in the temple or was admitted there, I lived not doing service to Krishna, but to God
oh yes
No, there are different kinds of service that one can do, preaching, singing the holy names of the lord, cooking for the lord as an offering to God.
and it makes different activities, no
aha
not everything, I mean you do your, the center of your life is God no, and you offer him everything you do, all your actions, all that you cook, all that you do, and the moment that you get up you go to the altar and we
we offer food to the lord then this is good now and I am married and I have children then i have to worry about them
of course
OK but if I always go to church no and I have there devoted we get together most Sundays or for big celebrations that we have throughout the year.
Mm
ah OK.  And do you have a prophet or something like Jesus Christ, how is it?
well we have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada Ace Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, he is God's devout who brought this knowledge here to the west.
aha
no and he is who we really no, or- we honor and
What is his name?
well we respect Jesus Christ very much also it is not that we don't respect other religions, other beliefs.
yes of course
of course and, but he brought the knowledge, here to the West about the consciousness of Krishna like we, call it the name of the city.
ah OK
Mm
And what is that man's name or?
Mm
What is his name?
it calls international society for the Krishna consciousness
ah, ok, ok, but, what's the name of the man who brought here?
ah, his name is Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
ok, is he from India, where is coming from?
yes, he was born in India
ah OK
well he is no longer on the planet, no he died when he abandoned his body
ah OK but then I mean he it is very possible that he has reincarnated in someone else o he doesn't reincarnate because he has karma.
no, I mean he is very devout, he is considered a pure devout of God then he is there turned to the spiritual world
ah OK, then he no longer reincarnates
no, no he has not reincarnated because the goal of life in this world, in this material world is for one to develop his devotion to God
aha
and that you go back to the spiritual world and the spiritual world no longer comes to this material world despite this cycle of being born illness and death that all living entities go through
yes exactly
no even animals and human beings
OK of course
no
and then, then he already went to that level and no longer reincarnates
nn aha
OK
yes he is already at that level, he is now a pure devout
ah very interesting
no it is very interesting, it would be good if you are not interested you can
and you guys how long have you been in that religion?

oh my god
then well well I have a class on Friday but not
not usually
it is not more more if it's nothing in general I am not going because it is more than that there is a graduate student who helps him but really the class
ah it is during the week where there is a professor but that is more if you need help right?
of course and one week you told me that you had an exam like on Friday or something like that
then yes, yes on Friday I have an exam then I was studying and then I have, yes I have several things this week, Friday I also have homework to
a math class that I am taking and I also have um eh I am taking a marketing class and also there I have another, another homework then
mm a little of each one
ah in a week if you have a busy week but at least I have
yes, you know
this two days off, yes
we are getting closed to the end of the program, I believe because I see.  How many calls do we have? I think we are close no?
Ah I still not I I many night I am busy and and cannot then
ahh
only me maybe I have only twelve, thirteen, yes
ahh OK I will cancel.  I had a few days but only three days or something like that I am going close to twenty I think or something like that
ahh yes that is why I want to hurry because I know that soon
you chiii
people will soon stop doing it
soon the matter will go away but there is people that are starting right now
ahhh
I spoke with a person and I was told in the first call from a Peruvians guy
m
that is certain that is the same Pennsylvania University
ahh
and study study ah the history, history
ahhh, if everybody in the world
what what
know someone in the university or they study in the university because
that's right
Otherwise I don't know how one will know about this
yes, please wait a second, someone's knocking on my door and I have to open, one moment
okay, yes, sure, sure
hello, I'm sorry, well it's been like four minutes
yes, yes, it's OK
they never open when I want them to open
no, but I think that program has had several problems with the computer that, or, I don't know, the devices that call
yes, yeah
that record, because it happened to me once or twice that I was in the middle of the conversation and suddenly the call was dropped
it happened to me like three or something, and then I sent a mail to this Shudong, Shudong who knows what
Hmmm, yes, Shudong, yes
and she answered and told me it happened to several people
yes
the same problem, then another email came saying that she was warned that some participants didn't speak Spanish very well
yes, those
yeah, and that I should hang up when it happ
yes, Shudong
ahh
yes, Shudong says just hang up on them, but I feel embarrassed, I don't know
a lady from new york, doesn't speak too much spanish, but I've talked to her twice, i laugh a lot because
ohh
her name it erdestina, have you talked to her?
mhm, mhm
ernestina, i am josefina, we laugh
ah
and i tell her ernestina, josefina, so then
yes
we laugh a little and she tells me that thing about her family.
but is she american?
i don't know because the other day i talked to someone in the house and they told me she was from an island.
its nothing big but its an island from
mmm
the Caribbean has special language, right, or something like that.
oh, and not necessarily spanish.
yes, but she still understands, well one does.
yes yes yes
she explains it well to her, and what about the email? have you bought it? or have you requested it?
no never never, i have two accounts, i have two accounts in hotmail, and one in
the university and the university never sends me anything
no
thus unsolicited e-mails  but in hotmail is terrible all days receipt them
ah
twenty, twenty five messages and all garbage but
aha you won that, you put as I receipt them from Msn, I have Msn
mmm
then Josefina was awarded with this she obtained press here you have a free scholarship and have I don't know
ah
and a trip, uhh and the cruises and
eh yes
and I erased them because those are for knowing
yes
if you answers to them they don't stop
yes the sad thing is that they do because the people that send all those mails they have,they put,and create programs
that go through Internet from a website to another website then when they find
mmm
an email addres
ah
put them in a list and then if
and I say, How do they find out so much of us, don't they ?
yes yes so also they go to the news group and also in
people so weird
to everything so it's very easy that for instance the directories, for example the directory of Hotmail I imagine there too as well.
they look for names and look so they make a huge list
wow
and so with that list they make their message right and so they send it to everyone in the list, but so, the quantity of work that is required is little, is very little right?
mhm, mhm
and if two, three people respond of thousands of people they won enough money for what it is
to finance the costs right?
yes yes that is sad, is that
oh but that is
with two three idiots they bother everyone, right?
yeah but it is horri-horrible because  I leave this a little controlled with the filter, they put me a spam filter
mhm
I lost it, I didn't buy it but they put it in my MSN
mm
I think that filters a little but not always the junk where it says junk, there are about ten or twelve a day, right?
yes it happens all the time I have read an article that looked pretty interesting that Microsoft wants to do that they are making a software.
hum every time that one sends a message the computer has to do something I don't know it breaks a code or do a tasks so its not
very very big
Right.
But that requires a little bit of work, ¿right?, so if you're only sending emails, you write an email and you don't even know if you sent it, ¿right?
So
And then when, then, when the computer does that job, then it breaks a code, then that's exactly what Microsoft does, uh, it gives the email a certificate that the email
That the person took a little time to make, ¿right?, so if you're only sending two mails, it doesn't matter, then the mail arrives and it knows it's not spam, but if you're sending millions of emails
Um
You don't have, the computer's processing power is not strong enough to do that much work, ¿right?
Right
Sending so many emails, so it takes longer, and possibly what it expects is that it will take so long that i think it will be too
slow and they won't be able to send all the emails they send nowadays
Oh
and the moment you get an email without that certificate, you know that it's spam, and you can throw it out
Or it has to have like an annex, or an attachment, something like that that says
Yes, yes, i don't know exactly
If you want you can open this e-mail, something like that, you know
I don't know exactly what it is, but i think it's an idea
Right, mine has, i mean, i have had, because when i send over yahoo, because i have a mail, a division
Right
in yahoo, and sometimes when I'm going to send an e-mail, it asks me to identify something that's like ciphered, you have to decipher it, right?
Um
They say this is for protection
yes.
Messages like that.
yes, yes
Then they put the pieces, the letters like you see them
Uh-huh.
But at times it is a, a, J
Hmm.
the, and a number or something like that
and the numbers, yeah
you've seen it right, its more like a puzzle right?
yeah I've seen it, yes mhm,mm
I don't know if its that what
yes, i don't know, i dont know
to protect.
but it seems like the filters aren't that reliable, right? because one thinks, that every time someone says something like that, then yeah it has a.
a a, like how do you say it, its like saying something you suspect, you can throw it into the spam folder, but sometimes
oh yeah
the people that create the spam know that the frases are suspicious, so the frases in general activate
ohhh
so then they create that form message right?
that doesn't get filtered
don't let him touch the filter that way, yeah yeah cause then
oh and since its in between, you've thought about the forums of univison or Telemundo right
ahh yeah once in a while
and when you write a word like a retard, or an idiot it doesn't read, right? like it says it doesnt permit it.
oh that's interesting.
Hello, how are you?
Aodri Hello, How are you?
Very well, I'm Miguel Angel, and I am in Philadelphia, and you?
My name is Aodri and I am in New York
are you in New York, mm, where are you from? from Argentina, don't tell me
No, I am Peruvian
Ay, I'm sorry! Because You had the "cho" you know you have the "chor" accent, I thought, this is Argentinian
You are not the first to say that, don't worry
Ah , ok, OK
But tell me
What did? what's your name?
Odri
Atri?
Aodri
Ah, oh, oh Odri, like Odri
Yes, yes exactly, exactly
Nice, nice, very nice
Well, what do you think about the mail? Not requested
what do I think about the not requested mail, well is a problem
yes
throw it to the trash immediately
no oh yes
when it gets
to me when i open my email i see it many when i see that i say oh this! because sometimes it tells me
to me make nerves
five, nine messages and i had been written i see that are five new ones and four
yes
it was directly to the trash
mmm well about the email is a scandal, about of spam
no but the good thing is that by example the service that i use for email
Which do you use yahoo?
how is it name no i use Gmail
oh Gmail yes
yes they can assign
mmm
i don't know how they do it, but they have a way to verify that is spam, and put them in other folder
mmm
so i work in that, i am going to tell you works fine ninety percent of the time
yes i have it and its true, i have yahoo too, and also about the spam it put it in other folder
yes
And if you don't want to read it, no, you don't have to read if you don't want to.
Yes, Mm, I believe.
Mm, no, if that isn't the truth.
I believe that the majority of the technical services for mail have this now, because it's like an invasion and they try whatever way to put
words as if it were a conversation and it's not just in English because I'm going to say that
Ah, no, no.
I also receive a lot in Spanish, eh.
yes, yes, yes.
My personal mail and my work mail, and I receive a lot, a lot, a lot
Mm, not only in Spanish, you see I've been living in Spain, uh-huh, up until last year, I've only spent a year here, you know, in the United States.
So in Spain it's the same, in other words there is a lot of spam there and I don't believe it matters what language, it's already international.
Bad things quickly reach everywhere, eh.
So then you've never bought anything from spam.
Ah, I have bought, I've bought things on the Internet, I mean, I've bought books from Amazon and I've bought concert tickets and things like that, but it's always been on my own initiative, you know,
ah, so if I want to buy a book or I want to buy some CD or I want to buy a concert ticket or movie or whatever
But it's simply that I wanted to, you know, it's never because it was sent to me in spam and I have not ordered or bought as a direct result, I don't read it, you know, I delete it.
So no, and when I receive something unsolicited by mail, or something like that, same thing, I throw it out right away, you know, I don't even look at it.
And at times, man, it's also true that sometimes I read it, but no, usually it doesn't interest me. How about you? have you ever bought anything?
No, I, no. But I remember that almost a year ago I read a magazine article about a man that
Mm.
As that, he loves buying stuff, stupid things.
Hmm
He lives on that and I stop, it seems to me, I've never meet someone who
right, right
who has bought from spam but because everyone get- get this fury when they see that blessed spam that this, that that and i
also most of those things are i mean they sell you stuff of, that later, later they don't send it, they keep the money
they send you a product of very low quality, i mean, they sell you this things, they aren't, they are you, they're really because they sell, no well we sell you this look that, and then maybe sometime
I've met people who has bought it and said well this is shit, this is something that breaks after two days or
or it breaks or you know that then they aren't things of quality because if you said
yes
if you said  well this, this is great, this that, this those, no, but all that of spam, that's all that's all shitty.
yes, it's, it's disgusting
it's a like, it's like the yes, eh, yes, it's like the, li, that sell of of and all those catalogues that are of
of super absurd things like that like one thing to scratch your back and that's one and have you seen those catalogues that of silly th- of silly things, of sillies?
have you seen that, i mean super silly stuff
yes, yes, no, yes, you, you know what that
yes, that for example, one
maybe there's a reason to have it but it's something that, to spend the money because uh
and have you seen that that goes, it's like some boots that have a plug to heat your feet, have you seen that?
yes, yes
yes, and things like that, no, that they sell it to you like that, the lady shows up like that. Lord with the feet put in, put in that little boot, who
it heats up and it heats up the feet I sometimes think of buying that, my mother
No but you know what I always say, I say, someone has to be buying this for them to send them as they send them
Sure
And, and they have la-, laws that, in the state of Virginia it's illegal
mhm
To send spam, an unsolicited email
yes
But all the same many arrive, a lot of them arrive
yes,
That's also like for example the ones that dial on the phone, Ouch, ouch, that really I, that really gets me mad, when I see
Ah, no, no, the ones that call you on the phone, yes, I tell them right away no
yes,
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am not interested, and that's it I hang up
No, no, no, no I'm not so kind with them. No, no, no, I ask them what they are doing with my name, take my name away immediately
So, there's a thing, I don't know if it's federal but in the state yes, our governor did it and it's of a cover
And that you can, you can enter your name and if someone calls you they have to to pay a fine because it says that no calls should be made
yes, I have it, my boss, my ex-boss, what he used to do when they called him from, from one of those cards, to raffle a house, what do I know
Eh, from mortgage. He used to tell them wait a minute and he left them there waiting, because he said look. When I have to speak to a costumer service for whatever, for the credit card, the bank, what do I know
they always place me on hold for a long time, so I love to tell them
Yes
wait, I leave it there, and he would love doing that.
Yeah man, You don't know whats been happening as well, it makes me kind off sad, people work in that, its not that its, dont laugh, but its true.
it makes me, makes me sad that, that people have to work and make money while calling then treating people like men, and when I'm not interested i say im not, and just hang up.
But i try to be a little polite, cause you know people are working to live by being phone call operators, its not funny to them as well.
That people talk to them in a rude way, and insult them, and then hang up the phone on them, with out picking up.
I don't know, when i was younger, i was a student and that seemed well, I'm still a student but when i was younger,
Well man, in summer i worked as a phone operator, it wasn't selling products, i didn't sell, i
oh
I would receive calls, i didn't make the calls.
yeah
And i was working for a provider in spain, and i was working for a security company.
yes
and the time, was like, like they call it here, an assistant.
oh okay okay
And the people that called were the ones that got stuck, so we got a call from someone, and sent them a toe truck to get their car.
and then, wow i mean i worked eight works a day, and their comes a time in which you are tired of it, you get tired of people calling you with their problems.
and well, people insulting you, saying the actually want help, or just miss treating you. when you don't have the fault about anything, cause I'm the last one to consult.
I was the little one in the company, and i didn't know, you know when a company is good or bad, they paid me for
answering calls, and giving them service, that's why it makes me sad for the people that call.
Because that people that does not call you do not have the intention to give you a hard time.  People that call you  do not have the intention to bother you the people that call you want to eat, like you and like me, you know
And want to have a job, then
yes
I don't know I feel a bit bad, that is I understand that That if, that no, that it doesn't, that not for feeling bad I am going to buy a product that they are selling me, that, that would top it all
but you know, but at least to treat them well and tell them look Well I a not interested that's it, you know Because people like they say here do not, have much attitude here in the United States
yes
It is one, it is one of the things that I note, I note the cultural difference, no, and What in Spain we call to be, to be a "son of a bitch"
yes
yes, that to me I don't know, that is no, you know Sometimes one has to be a "son of a bitch" because people are driving you a little crazy no, to their face but
When here is not need to be a "son of a bitch", well there isn't a reason to, you know
You are right, it is not always like that, but i will not, I will not lie to say that no, I always am there, no and I don't want to Ah,
I see
Because it is the same thing Especially when they call on my cell phone I say: oh
Sure, sure
In the middle of the day or sometimes at work, I don't know, and look I have a lot of things to do.
yes, yes
its not for you to be bothering me
listen and tell, Odri, what is a Peruvians girl with an Argentinian accent doing in New York?
Well, eh you know, is, is. is a kind of long story, but first I well I. Eh, I was born here from Peruvians parents but they also went
aha
Then your parents were young
aha
none of my parents have Peruvians accent, not even my grandmother, neither my grandfather had
um
Eh, my grandfather lived in Argentina for a decade and
ah, of clourse
he was, eh very attached to the Argentinian culture and all that
Ah, that's why
Yes and, my mother has some of the accent
Um
and then I also have it, I have it stronger, and also I work for and Argentinian studio
Ah, of course
Then I get their accent yes, yes so, but no, No, no, no, it's not, is a legal studio
Hello?
Hello, good day
Good day. My name is Jenny and I am calling from New York
My name is Anny, and I am calling from Miami
Ah, okay. Hello.
Hello
Can you hold on for a moment, The phone is ringing on the other line and I will return immediately
Okay
Okay
Hmm, mm, I'm coming out
Hello?
Yes, it doesn't matter
Pardon, ah, which was the, the theme of this call?
Music
Ah okay. Good, begin. Yes yes, you want to start
Ah, music, eh. We passed the entire day listening to music. I have a 23 month old daughter
Oh okay
And no, I don't let her see the TV, but I always have
Uh, hmm
music on. That was her throwing a play to the floor because we are trying to
Oh, okay
Sorry.
No, it's okay. Don't worry.
But, you know, we spend the whole day listening to music.
Hm mm
classical, or you know, playing whatever. And we listen to it in English and Spanish.
Uh, okay
So, when his father is at home, we only speak in English.
Hm mm
But when he leaves for work, we only speak in Spanish.
Oh yes. Okay. I understand.
So, but, what about you?
Oh, well, I, uh, normal. I, I, oh, listen to all kinds of music.
Aha.
No, I don't have a favorite, I like listening to anything. Even foreign music.
Aha.
Um. And yes, I spend the whole day listening to different types of music, because, like they say, music calms down.
Hm mm, hm mm
Even the most ferocious animals, I think it is so. So, now I work at home.
Hm mm, hm mm
And i work in the court. So then  I'm not in the court discussing something, i'm in the house. And, in those moments you feel more agitated,
Hmm
Ah, it's the best moment to put the radio, and listen something that calms you and leaves you relaxed, in the
yes
in the way of thinking like it should. Um, still no, i don't have kids but um, i lasted a few yours working in a pre care
Aha
And that was the best, when you wanted that
Hmm
a class of, of eighteen kids of only four years
yes
you put, some kind of music ah, classical
Hmmm, we
and like it changes, the whole mod of the room. Because if it affects the human animal sense, like they say
Right like we had an
So hmm
not a good moment, but mi daughter like two months ago started to sleep by herself when night came, alone
Oh, okay
Bu when she had seven, eight years we took her from our bed,
Hmm
to her cradle. And i couldn't, you know, i had a lot of trouble making her sleep, and finally i discovered that if i, eh, put her some music, with a sound machine,
Hm mm, hm mm
you know, that she sleeps well. Y now, we bought her an iPod
Okay
Because what I do is I have, you know, a month and like a hundred or so CDs
Hm mm
so I can choose what I want her to hear. Normally when we put her to sleep
Hm mm
we choose, you know, the lullabies, I think they're called
Already
So, I put on the music, I turn on the machine, the sound machine.
Hm mm
Well, we read her some books. And already, she knows that when she hears that, she begins to sleep. She sleeps better. I put her to sleep in the crib, and like in 5 minutes, she is already
Wow, so already she has a routine
sleeping, yes, and that, for that reason, well, it was one of the reasons that we bought the iPod
Hm mm
because also when we are in the car, she wants her songs and whatever and in order for one to carry 500 or so CD and have them in the car
Ah yes, it's better to carry an iPod that
And but, she also is a good, she's not, sometimes she makes a model of a baby
Hm mm
So we bought her the iPod with the money that she
Oh.
herself, you know
Aha
that she herself, worked.
So is, more or less, with her laziness, you did it
yes, yes
Ah good, that is a good idea.
We did it, well partly her, and partly me, because I have my music there also, So, you know,
Well, yes. Is not just going to be her music only.
yes, So
Oh, oh, that's not how things are
Well, probably ninety percent is hers.
Oh, wow
And you know, because like that if we are somewhere, whatever, because the car is hers too,
Hm mm
it has, like, a headphone.
yes.
if not with that, and, and when we bought it, I thought that she was going to put you know, a Walkman or something and now I'm doing it
No, that's the best, that's the best because I tell you from the point of view of a person that was an educator
yes, me too,
The music that li- the, the children that the parents, let them to, them, they cultivate in them the love for music it is rather uhm, to teach them to read
Because it helps with the concentration, with uhm, the movements, if-, if one observes children some time when piano music is, is heard
with their little fingers they do as if they were playing a piano.  All of that helps.
Hm mm
for the, uhm, development.  I forgot, I forgot how to say development in Spanish.
yes, yes, I understood you don't worry yes.
Well the development, there it goes.  The development for the child to __, for the past, so it is doing a marvelous thing  Because I always thought about that.  I tell my husband very often.  When we have children,
there are several things, that you are going to think that are a little bit of crazy.  I was telling him, that I want
yes.
you know that I want to give birth in a bathroom with water, with music, and he was like aha.  You are kind of crazy
No, but look, we are going to have the, ehm, our next baby,
Hm mm
God willing, within one week
Oh wow
And, y know, that is what we are doing.  We are going to go to a, to a maternity center that is here, and that is what we are going to do.
Hm mm Yeah
Because you know, for me, the first was a c-section, and
Uu.
no, and it was not, because I wanted it.  It was supposedly because it was an emergency.
Oh, okay oops, sorry it Is the dog.  sh, sh, quiet
But I think that, okay
I'm sorry.
That okay. So,
Aha.
you know, we are going to do that. With her, she is not allowed to watch television.
That's better, yeah
you know, lots of times when we go to church and they speak about the Elmo dolls
Hm mm
or whatever, she just makes funny faces like she's thinking "what's that?", yes, people look at me like saying "doesn't she know who Elmo is?" and I go, well, we don't watch television.
No, that's better, the best way to make sure that she is a successful child. You have to keep that. That's the problem I have with my husband.
I tell him, his mother was a bit weird because she would let him watch television all the time.
Aha.
I don't know, I had a television until I had thirteen years old. My mom and dad hadn't bought one, we had nothing like that. He thinks it's weird.
that I was so advanced in school. I was way ahead in the education system, I finished the university early, he has waited for me. Everything that I've done, I've done it quickly
and easily and he, I always tell him that it's because I wasn't distracted. I had no TV to steal one or two hours from me.
take me away from my studies. I was always, focused, and my mom and dad, we were poor but if one of us wanted to play music, my dad and mom would do whatever they could so that we could get music lessons.
You know, we were interested in animals, we would go to the museum
yes.
on the weekends or, you know, we always had education. So, you grow up faster, I mean, when you become a teenager,
when you grow up you see the difference, and your friends know about this, they know about this
Yes.
and you feel weird, but afterwards, when you are much much more mature now, I look back and I say thanks. I tell my Mom, Dad, always, tha-, thanks a lot. Because now
I can buy that house that I want. If I want an Ipod, I buy it. I have one.
yes.
if I want, uh, a playstation, we have it here, all it does is collect dust
yes
because we don't play with it. I don't have interest, and my husband says that you're not going to sit down to play, I don't want to play with it either.
yes.
So that's that. But also I see the benefit of not have spent my youth
Well, and also, you know, I, like we're going to have the baby, I was thinking that we were going to put it
Hm mm
not to watch television, but for, I was looking at what programs I could let her watch that were educational, but
Well, today there's not many programs
yes, but I, I still couldn't
according to, there are, there are a lot, uh, they have, uh on channel thirteen they have about 2, that still survive, two, that have the approval of the educational system here
yes, but,
in New York
what happens to me, is that, that I know that on television, I'm not going to have any problem, eh, in getting her interested
Hm mm
And that I prefer if I can, until she's at least three or four years old,
Hm mm
that she continues with her love of books, and music and all that, I mean, you know, that we continue with that. I don't know
No
yes, when the ba- the baby arrives, that, that I'm going to fell that that in order for me to put, to have a bit more tiem, you know,
the most I'll do, if I do it, it's going to be half an hour a day, and it's going to be a program that what do I know
Hm mm Yeah
you know, educational
Well, I, I have confid-, I don't know you, but I trust that you'll do a wonderful job, because the way I hear you talking
it's all that I, in my mind, saw and said, OK, this is what I want to do. This is what I want to watch and when I speak with my husband he, ah,
I don't know any longer, I don't know but
But als-
but it's, it- I'm listening to you and I realized that it is good, you know, everything you're saying is perfect. No, there's nothing
that I would do differently, as they say.
Well, the, the biggest difficulty that we have is that, w- we don't watch too much television
Hm mm
But, and, if you go into ou- to our house, you think that we watch a lot of television with, because our house, eh, has a,
came with those, televisions of fifty two inches.
Oh my goodness, OK
So, also, last Christmas, we bought a TiVo.
OK
Then, we taped- we taped the you know, those old movies, and, or, series we were interested on but
Hm mm Hm mm
But it is nothing, we never watch ABC, NBC nothing of those.
Oh, yes, that is the best
Always is the Discovery Channel, or what, you know, that kind of things, the History Channel
Yeah. right.
But that's why, because I don't want that she watches TV, to me my husband, he is watching less TV,
Oh yes.
Because when he is at home, and she is awake, don't, you know, not turn on it.
Oh okay, okay
so, that, that was one of the difficulties that we still have a little bit, that he, he is like, you know, he understands that I don't want that she watches TV
But he does not understand, that he is watching TV, she is watching
Is like, is like allowing her
Right.
Yeah. That one, that is the problem that I have with mine. I say, because also, I don't watch TV. I am all the time in the bedroom
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, my name is Zola, from Texas.
Oh, I'm Manuel, from Chicago.
hi, Manuel.
How are you doing?
Well. And you?
Fine, fine.
Are you already a father again?
Huh?
Are you already a father again?
I'm already a father again.
I see. There was no problem.
No, everything was good.
Oh, that's good, that's good.
It was only about five minutes ago that I had my baby in my arms.
I see.
Because they took him to eat.
Uh huh. Is he already at home, or still in the hospital?
Yes, here at home. The following day we left the hospital, the day after he was born.
Ah, how nice.
, everything came out well, and no, we were only, after he was born, from the labor, twenty four hours, and that was it.
Mhm. Now, wake up every, , every two hours.
yes.
Uh huh.
Every two hours it must be fed.
Mhm.
Well, they are, uh, breast-feeding it.
Mhm.
So, you don't have to be worrying about giving it the, the preparing it milk, or anything.
Mhm. Ah, well. So, you don't even have to wake up.
That's good. No. That- Not, not at all, once or twice I wake up only, but only to be with them, there.
Mhm.
. Right.
I spoke with, um, Jenny,
yes.
and I also spoke with your brother. But, I forgot the name.
Ah, yes?
Because, yes, he started to do it. To do the study too. Because, ah, Jenny stopped participating.
How come, she hasn't told me any of that?
yes, the, I mean, that's what he told me when I spoke. Because, look I spoke two, two times with a lady from New York,
.
and she was talking but, very little Spanish, very, she spoke Spanish very badly.
Okay
So, I sent an e-mail to the person in charge of the study, and I asked what would happen if I, oh, I had to talk to someone who didn't speak Spanish well.
yes.
And, he told me to hang up fast, to hang up the call, because he wasn't going to count that call.
Okay.
So, he sent an e-mail to everybody, saying that if you spoke to someone who didn't speak English-e Spanish well,
eh, not to talk to that person.
yes, I also got one of those e-mails.
yes.
.
So, it seems that, oh your brother told me that Jenny read that message, and so she decided not to participate anymore.
yes, yes she told me something like that, but, oh, I-I, she didn't tell me she was going to stop, stop participating. She just said she had,
that she thought it was because of her.
Oh, aha.
Oh.
No, no, I told your brother, to tell him that, that I was the one that sent that e-mail, and that, that I hadn't sent it because of her, I had sent it because of that other person that didn't speak any Spanish, she only knew very little words in Spa-
MM
ah
because, I think that speaks Spanish very well call.
yes, she speaks well.
mmm
It is, she is, it's funny, you get in the car of her, ah, brings a van. A caravan.
aha
At once, to me it made ​​me weird. I got, and the brings, and Nebraska when I was there with them,
mmm
uh, I've been using a few days, and grabbed the box which brings all the CDs
mmmm
I said, to see happen is to bring music in Spanish
mmm
Here, then, you will not believe, brought as sixty or seventy CDs,
mmm
all in Spanish. And then I asked him, Hey, Jenny, I say, tupara that as you bring music in Spanish? I say, because you do not bring in Spanish? no, says I like to hear pure Spanish, if I do not like English
ah
oh, I said, well
mmm
yes, she knows everything, I do not know how because I do not know, also, how long have I to practice Spanish or Spanish speaking. But, he speaks very well.
eh. ah, as has already married to your brother? because it sounded like your brother's kids are big now.
Ah, what happens is that she had the baby before.
Ah, oh, she already had,
But, they have like, I'm not sure, approximately four years.
Aha.
Three or four years
Yes, ah, o-
Yeah and she had, she has kids from a previous marriage.
yes.
Ah, they have only a girl,
Mhm.
of my brother.
Because, i can't remember what we were supposed to talk about, but your brother was telling me that, em, no, I was asking him if, if he had had any problems living there in Nebraska,
since there are almost no Hispanics. And, he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there are no, there are no Hispanics, he is the only Hispanic.
yes.
And, I asked him if he had had problems with people looking at him askance, or speaking to him, and he told me no, that he only had problems once with,
with the dad of one of the other kids that competed in wrestling with his, with his children.
Ah, yes. One, one of them competes in wrestling.
Mhm.
But, you know, wherever you go you're going to find good people and bad people.
Sure, yes, that always happens.
yes.
But, well, he told me that no, that he did not have many problems, that in fact, he would invite everybody, to the Christmas parties, and all
yes, I noticed that.  They are not so, I think that where there is a town where there aren't much Hispanics, more so that there is nothing,
Hmm.
and you know, in, where there are many Hispanics, there are many, ehm, the bad friendships start, and all of that, the bad people.
Sure, ehm
So, the Americans start looking at that badly, already no, to, to him
Hmm
That is, to a Hispanic.  They start seeing that all of them are the same, they think.
Sure
And since over there there aren't, don't, don't have,
Prejudices, yes hmm
yes.  They don't think, this is a Mexican, this one is not going to do that, it's not going to do the other thing.
Hmm, hmm
No, n- I think, they have not, they have not experienced mush with many Mexicans.
yes.
And, m- by the same, there aren't, there is not, there must not be Mexicans, since, there is nobody to do bad things.
Hmm
You see that the Mexicans have a party, one or two am,a nd the music at a very high volume, and like that
Hmm
And there's nothing like that there. Until now, now there's, later there will be more Hispanics coming
Right, it happens.
Yeah
¿And you, what music do you listen?
Texan
Texan, yeah, um.
I like it a lot, i lived for long, uh, i lived in Texas for a long time. I like a lot the one they call like Tex-Mex.
Um.
All that music.
Um.
And still, here almost, sometimes, i can't find records of that, i search, but, since they don't listen to it here, they don't play it much
Uh
So no. But, yeah, sometimes, when my brothers come, or i go there, i bring music from there.
And Mexico's traditional music, don't you like it?
Regularly, i like northern music, northern.
Um, um.
Yeah, like, the traditional, like Mariachi and all that, not much. Banda too
¿No?, un. Oh, well, and, ¿what about the regular music in spanish?
Yes
That, from any country, i don't know, like
Oh, what do I like to listen to?
Yeah
I like to listen to a lot of Colombian.
Colombian?
Yes, music, they are a lot.
You like Cumbia?
Yes, a lot, yes, a lot of Cumbia-Yes, a lot of very calm music, right?
Yeah
Not very loud.
Oh, Ok.
Yeah I brought some in my car. I always bring music in my car. Someone came up, turn it up, no, I like to listen to it but on low, only on low.
Yeah
Nothing else more, like so the music relaxes me in a short time.
Of course, yes its good to listen to music in the car, yes. It entertains you and if you're traveling alone in the car its good to listen to music.
Yes
Im one of those peope that listens to music all the time, and I have friends that also listen to it all the time. Now people have those, MP3's.
yes
Where they can have eighty, one hundred, or two hundred songs. They always have it in their ears listening to music.
No, Its not good, at least to me. I don't like it a lot like that.
Yes a don't like it. I do once in a while. Yeah yeah, to relax me or in the car or if I'm going to exercise I also like to listen to music.
Yes, there are people who can not sleep like my brother who lives in Nebraska.
Ok.
There was a time when he couln´t go to sleep because he had no music playing.
Hey!
I used to tell him, turn off the radio, can´t you go to sleep without music.He said I waked up happy and I go to sleep happy.
Each one.
Yes, I like to wake up with music. Then, My alarm clock it´s just the radio.
The heart kills you.
Yes
I like the music that the radio plays because that way I wake up slowly and relax.
Yes.
OK.
Do you like to go to the club in Texas?
When I got to Houston I used to go dancing a lot.
Yes.
Yes I found a group of people when I went to school and we used to go out a lot. Now I don´t have the time to go out anymore.
OK.
But, after I don't, it's almost like I got tired of going out because I had already gone to all of the same places, and you see the same people, and
The places were always full of people. When I used to go dancing you coudn´t even dance because the people could easily step on your feet. That´s is why I don´t go out anymore.
Yes.
Additionally, one has to pay to much to get into the places
That yes
It's worth ten or fifteen dollars, to get into the places. Then, no, already, no. Since now I prefer, if I'm going to go out, I prefer to go to a place that is more peaceful
Ah
Yes, only to sit and talk and
Here there is a dance room, where groups of Mexicans come
Mhm
Like from the north, and everything
Ah
You won't believe, they charge 50 dollars for entrance
Wow, but they bring groups, well know groups, or? Ah
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, y even like that, people remain outside, they cannot gain entry
Wow, but it's that, it is, you live in a big city
Yes
So,
I went one time, and yes I liked it, yes its beautiful
Mhm
What happens is, is you can't walk
Yes, and no. That is the problem, yes
Like they are, they bring groups, good groups from Mexico, all the people what to listen to them
Of course.
if the hall can hold four thousand people, that's just how many get in. And no. From there, it was the only time i went, and i never liked to go there anymore.
Yes.
And now, i don't go out like that, because of that, that's a lot, a lot of trouble. You go out, ¿hello?
¿Hello?
Uh, i thought it got cut.
No, no, no. I'm here.

No, is not the, almost
because many

So, that's why you do not miss that too much, right?
No, no,no because before
That's great!
In Puerto Rico I listened to boleros, salsa, but I do not like boleros too much nor do I like salsa because these are not dance-able
of course
These are more romanticos
of course
much, but we use merengue a lot
yea,
like, Olga Tañon, Elvis Crespo
Oh, yes, yes, yes
Here in Chicago, there are a lot of parades from Puerto Rico

What good times
And they are free. They come a lot also, come, ah, much much they make something that says "Cheer Chicago"
Aha
and they bring a lot of music from Colombia, of Mexico of all parts of Puerto, of the the world.
And so you don't feel to far from where one comes. Eh? Yes.
Aha, aha, aha
it is all of that
Aha
yes, here in Idaho, no here there is nothing. Here the only music that there is it's music like Mexican like
Aha
I don't know what its called, but its something like 'salty' I'm not sure what it is.
ha
but its the kind of music that I've never heard of before, not even in chile.
no,
and of course, in Chile one listens to music like bolero and
ha
things like that, but of course over here its like whatever, because no one listens to it, and nobody comes here anyways, so nobody has someone to
true
ha ha
none of that, and now I'm listening to the radio by satellite.
ha
and with that I've don't it, I've remembered many songs in spanish, because after ten years, I'll listen to songs that play like
regueton and all that stuff.
ha ha
i didn't have an idea of that, because i haven't listened to Spanish in about ten years.
ohh, we've got a radio station here in chicago, its 93.1 fm
and its Spanish music.
they put on regueton all day long.
mm that's good
ha so, specially when someones driving.
yeah
you don't get bored because you put the, the radio very loud and, and the trip seems like
of course
quickly, and you don't get bored, you don't sleep in the car, or nothing
of course
listening to mucis
yes, is goo, is good to have music in Spanish becuase,
yeah
because English is good but is not the same
No, no
because is not like you have grown up with, nothing like that, uhm
yeah, yeah, yeah
yes, now I am happy with, with being able to listen to music in Spanish again because it is really different
yeah
in the mood and all that.
is like that music that, I don't know if you are listening, do you listen to the music that they have, uh, uh, when they are, when you are waiting for a person
that you pick the phone to talk? I do not like that music, because, ah that music is like, like classic and is music like when you
to put yourself to see
when you are going in elevators
of course
The music they have, for me, for me
aha
is not nice and they should change it. They should play music, ah Merengue or Bachata, or the music
Sure
ah Like, like Cumbias, Cumbias are nice.
And it would be more cheerful No?
Aha, aha, aha
Instead of getting mad well, waiting so long, at least one can dance in the meantime No?
Aha, aha, aha No, is that, ah One falls asleep waiting.
yes
Look right now I was waiting ah, fifteen minutes. So that they could connect me.
Really?
Aha, the other time I was waiting half an hour, and when they were going to connect me to someone they hung up on me because supposedly at eleven at night
is when they hang up the calls.
Really?
Aha, aha, aha
My
How many times have you called?
Twice with this one.
Oh yes, with this one it makes

Oh, and you can call more than one time during the day
No, no, js, just one time
One time a day

yes, the other time I spoke, I spoke With my sister, because we called each other at the same time.
Aha
And my sister lives in Atlanta, in Giorgia
ohh
And I spoke with her.  She is the one that the recording of for this program when you hear the girl talking s-saying what to do and all of that,
aha, aha
she, she is my sister
Ohh
So when she dib the recording she told me to call so we could listen the and speak with her, I was the only time that I spoke, because I didn't talk any more after that, since
Oh
So this is my first time talking to someone else.
Oh lord!  You are missing a lot, you're missing twenty-three.
yes. So I got cracking and that's why I called, because I was waiting for someone to call me. But nothing was happening.
Because because the other time they put for Politics.
Aha
But I called and nobody nobody, picked up the phone, nobody, nobody.
Is that is scary No?
But aha, but to me. At five in the afternoon, every afternoon they call me. Here for, someone that, that
Ah, yes
that if I want to get the phone to talk. But since I don't get the phone, because I don't know what topic they are talking about.
Ah
since music is there. this is the second time that I talk,
Of course
I've talked to many people. from, from Nebraska, from Philadelphia from Miami,
Ah, look
yes
No, I like the topic of music, it's simpler; the other time when it was a topic of immigration, I think it was.
Oh, yes, I also talked about that
That one is like scarier to talk about Politics and Migrations because
Uh huh
What was, doesn't say. I don't know
Of, about politics I don't like, but I spoke about immigration, about music I spoke About marriage,
Ah, yes.
about cellulars, well a bunch. imagine I only have about nine left only thank God.
And after the twenty something one doesn't call anymore. Right ?
After the twenty-five you then wait two or three months, they send you the check to your house.
Ah, that's good.
yes.
Okay, I better get with it and get to calling then.
yes, after five in the afternoon you can call to whom you, you can ah, I mean you dial the telephone that comes up
Of course.
that you have to call. And you communicate there. But it has to be after five in the afternoon, because at that hour is when they change the
the the Title of what they're talking about, the topic.
ah, okay And everyday is different ?
Well the other day, I talked as if about five times about about marketin I spoke five times.
Ah, five days straight.
I spoke one Today with this one two about music I spoke three about matrimony I spoke only one about cellulars, well many topics.
Ah.
But, but they hadn't changed them, but now that that they put a woman to talk, well they have changed the topics.
Sure.
first you need. needed to speak well, lot lots of topics say, almost all the time they leave the same topics so people can talk.
Sure.
Look then,ah
Ah
you, ah when you are guiding, do you listen to music or not?
i heard the music as well but, ahm i also listen, but ablot, there was a long time where i stopped listening to music and started to listen.
problems,  conversation programs
aja
of politics
aja
but is like that one of- because of a lot of time
Yeah,yeah
And after, one notices that our music, Or I mean the music really changes your mood.
yeah
Why for the rest of the day No?
yeah,
So today, I started to listen to music so I can have better mood more energy.
yeah
Because I do not know, could be Latina blood I guess.
aha, aha
But one needs
yes, yes, yes
Needs that.  You kow, that, that the music for dance, the music for that
aha
yes, because here I do not listen much music like that style
aha
Really?
No, no merengue, no salsa, no, no, no, no Regueton, no nothing, It is just Regueton?
No, I like everything now
aha
Before when I was in Chile, I did not like Salsa or Merengue, nothing like that.  Now that I am here I love them
aha aha, aha
Now the only thing I need to lear it to dance, nothing else.  I love it.
No, but no, no, eh, you watch TV when they are dancing?
No, here they have nothing, nothing Latin, no Merengue, nothing, nothing here
Oh no
No, because there are very few Latins here
aha, aha
The majority here are like only Mexicans
Yes
But on TV, on the radio, there is nothing Spanish, nothing Latino
Not movies, or anything?
On TV, no, nothing
No?
No, nothing
Uh, um,
Like this, because we are in the middle of nowhere
Ah, blessed. Imagine that.
Yes, it's boring
Uh
Boring. When I went to California to visit it was
Betsy, Hello How are you?
Once, yes, it's me Tammy again, fine and you?, Oh my God
Sitting here, Let's see what you have to say about the social work or whatever because I have no idea
No, here well, I think some things are going right, but not others.
Aham, Aham
Specially, the old people whom are not getting enough money, or it's not the money but that they need medical help, They're not getting their pills totally paid
Oh
Then it's more difficult to them, you know, take the their pills because they have to think "Got to pay the pills" or "Got to eat"
Aha, Oh
Because they have to pay more and there are sometimes people too whom abuse. I know people that, well they're not friends of mine but I know they're abusing
Mhm yeah
from those uses, that people really, that other people really need
Mhm yeah
I know but it's difficult, I have my sister-in-law, my...the mother of my husband
Mhm yeah, Aha
and she is partially assisted but no, she's not getting that much helo and it's necessary too, she have to search for coupons and things like that so she can check if she could buy the medicine in another place to make it cheaper or
Buy a medicament this month or other one the other month
Oh no, that's gross. Aha
Because he can't get them all and that's bad because if they're not taking this things as they should be
Aha, no.
they are not going to help you so that is scary
and that is the welfare or the pension
if its not, mja or the welfare
oh that is it, right, I can imagine.
Right assistance that they give them here because they don't give you a lot so it's difficult and you have proof that you can show them that in truth
you have that but in any case if you do what it gives you its only if you work.
Right
and if you don't know they don't pay you well but they pay you twenty dollars or a little more than twenty dollars of the
Right
I think less than twenty dollars of the limit they give you is not going to help.
Yes.
I say this because it's twenty dollars more than the limit that they have but I mean it's not a lot.
Yes.
An they don't want to, so they prefer that you don't work.
Yes.
To be able for them to help you but with the help that they give you it's not enough to survive.
but yes they don't pay you all the medicine you need
no then that is the thing they can't they don't help you.
right
they don't want to help you because you do a lot supposedly and a lot is not much, you can't survive and you have to stop working so that they can help you.
and what they help is not enough anyway there's
it's not that much, m hah (?) so it is difficult, it's quite difficult for people to try to do that I think that I imagine that's why there are people who work under the table
uh huh, uh huh
because they can't say they're working because then they don't help him and they don't have enough and if you have children well that's another thing
right but but after they're eighteen years old they don't help you anymore, when your children are eighteen years old they don't help you anymore
no, no, so that because I was watching my son my kid the crazy that comes here to my house and tells me, ah mom why don't you want to apply for government so that I get lunches
mmha
I say hey we do too much so that you get lunches I think I give you so that you buy lunches and I give the paper
uh huh
four children, wait four people in the house want you to make like twenty-four thousand dollars
uh huh
that is not enough, a year, that is not enough
twenty-four thousand dollars a year, oh my goodness for four people no,
four people no specially if I take those people with a baby
uh huh
because that will, I say that's a lie, I was showing my husband and I tell him those people are crazy who's going to do I say where you work and where you live because here where I live
mm ha
no way that miracle that my son when he moved he found an apartment eh near to us that was seven hundred twenty-five a month and that is cheap
mm ha but it doesn't include utilities
mm ha, no that didn't include any of that so you imagine with two
uh huh, oh okay uh mmhmm more expensive
so I say that if a person who has four people at home and makes twenty four thousand can't, they can't
mmhmm, it's not enough
so for me that's why I always talk with my children, be careful, work take care of your your credit and save your money
mmhmm, ya, that they don't spend it on things that they don't need
because no way, mmhmm ya do you remember that I spoke with you yesterday
yes, uh huh, they already moved back
my son is back, the big one who move is in my house again he already got in a fight with the girlfriend and and the girl did something bad to him and that man my son when you do something to him he tells you goodbye and like that he never sees you again
boy
so he got everything, my husband went over there and grabbed all of his things and there is nothing of his anymore in that apartment
wow
now he did leave
that girl had to have done something very bad mm
uh huh, he very bad that this man got like that when he called me mom well and I tell him I support you so come over here I am going to convince him so that he goes to school because
well yeah and when he moved with the girlfriend he wasn't working, oh, uh huh
he was but now he is I want well he can go uh uh the people from the job said that he can go to school in the morning
mmhmm
and work afterwards so they help him so I tell him well I say if you move here, if you go to school I don't charge you rent
ya it's good that way uh huh
but if you don't want to go to school you're going to have to pay rent because I want for him to finish school
right, mja
why is that, I said lot of things specially with him yes him don't want to finish the school and he is going to have a hard time find things that is why I want
mja o have a good career also you are no going to send him to work at McDonald's forever
mja, that is why, there yes, yes because is what I said then something happen and you don't do and it feels like you will end up asking for assistance and you won't have, you are a man, right
mja
no is a necessity you are young not to finish things you have us here and we can help and you don't want to accept
mja
I always put the example of person that we know, look you don't want to finish, work hard
no, no don't want to because you want to, that the government won't help for nothing
mm, I don't know how is in Canada with him, with this, of the insurance
well, here you have to work when we got here, Just arrived from Del Salvador that it was 15 years ago and the gives us, a rent for an apartment
mja
bed and sofas and we were with welfare
aja, mja, aja
for a few months, because we went to the school and then my parents found jobs and my brother and I were in high school
and then mi parents were working and help my brother because he was fifteen years old
aja
and I was eighteen years old and they won't receive assistance for me. Only receive assistance for my brother but I was in high school and didn't work until, until when
yes but I was in the welfare sometimes but I think they assist you a little bit because you get a card for medicine
aja
mja, and this has to be presented in the store where you are going to buy the medicine and they pay it well that was the last time I asked for assistance.
but now ah now I don't know how it must be, it must harder.
no yes I don't know when my husband left, he was in the armed forces
right,
so we came here and they don't pay much either and that was in like ninety two.
right
and so when we came here there was not enough to pay rent so we had to join for one month
right
to help us sufficiently and for how much time It would take him to find a job and that took him a month.
how great
well after a month of finding a job but you know the next check so it took us that month and we left once from there but when one goes to the store with those, one of those that they give you that are fake papers
really?
the people will, yes when you go shopping that was years ago so now I think they give you a card.
oh right
but the people look at you badly
they look at you as if you were from other planet
right its not because they are helping you you look like you can work, we could work but we didn't have me with two child's I mean I can't work already because where am I going to leave the kids that I have and I don't have enough to pay him.
right
and so I said to my husband not ever again, ever
no
I mean, I'll work wherever I can, before going into that, I've always thought that is so low, I won't put my family through that
no
because they look down at you, as a man, if you are asking for help
it's like, mja
you can't, it's like things didn't go well for you, so it's hard
and I'm sure they are going through the same thing but they still look down on you
aha, they don't remember, people don't remember that
mja
but I'm not, I'm not like that when I get to see someone that is in need and I go like, this can happen to anyone, in fact it happened to me the other day
oh yea, of course
s, oh well, I think
they look down at people who get government benefits, real help, it's not a big deal
aha, well I believe that, they are not stealing anything, they are not getting those because they acted crazy or because they are stealing, they are
aha, I see
the went there because they had to go and ask for help, they might even not have wanted to do it but they had to
aha aha, and it's like they gave them a paper saying that the government is helping you and people know
aha
it's not money, I mean they are not sending you a check to your house or to you account
no, no, ah, eh, it's, it's well, they do send you a check
aha
well, that was in ninety-two, I think I remember. They used to send you a check and then a little book.
aha
a small pocket book that had something similar to the fake Monopoly bills
oh oh
and had the inscriptions of five dollars, twenty dollars so you would have to pull it out and give it to someone and then they wouldn't give you change
oh no
so you had to give them the exact amount because otherwise you wouldn't get it back
and the government would say that that was so that you would feel embarrassed
so, you had to be sure that you wouldn't use the coupons to buy alcohol or something like that because if you'd do that, people would see the coupons and you would feel ashamed, but nowadays they give you a card
ah, mm, aha

Oh, no she, she, she is very good.  She has her moments that, you know, does not, does not pay attention to what I am telling her
But,
yeah
when I talk to her and I ask her to do something, she does it. Because, well then, you know, I need her, her to do it.

Then that you know, the only thing we want, is for it to be healthy.
That is good. Ah, eh, it's been, it's been, and-hot in Miami today. Right?
No. Today, it was not very hot, it was pretty nice, a little hot, but it was cloudy. Also, it was pretty breezy. But, probably, the temperature still was about eighty, eighty-five, eighty-six, somewhere around there
Oh boy
But the humidity was not that high. So it wasn't a really hot day.
Oh.
Because, it doesn't affect much here, not only the temperature
Mhm.
but also the humidity. So we normally have, I believe, about seventy to eighty percent humidity.
Mhm.
And when you leave the house,
Yes,
you know, as soon as you leave, you begin to sweat. Because, it's as if someone is giving you a wet sheet
Ah,
It's very, you know, it's very sticky and,
Yes,
but, right now we are entering into an age that is not too bad, it's hot but the humidity has lowered
Oh.
But you know how, for example, y can wash my skin,
Yes
and I can be the entire night with wet hair
Oh
But I don't get dry because there is a lot of humidity
Oh boy
Y, especially if I clean myself in the morning and leave and I have it in a bun
Aja, ah
my hair stays wet all day
Oh wow
So that, you know, it isn't always too hot, like the humidity, I believe
Yes
So that, and there it's really cold still, no?
Ah, it's not cold, it's maybe seventy
Wow
Yeah, today it's cold. But you know, that that. But it's very, yeah, it's not cold. Yes
And when do you normally have snow?
What?
When do you normally begin to have snow, the time of snow, and all that?
Ah, maybe, the other day. That, 80, no 70. The other day it was seventy and, but today, it's very cold. And every day it's
The change, it's changed a lot. Maybe today it's seventy, tomorrow fifty, you know, like that
So, but when does it start to snow?
I don't know, I don't know
Because, I thought that, that it snowed in New York
Eh, in, in New York. Who?
You didn't tell me that you are, eh, eh, you live in New York
Yes.
Okay.
Yes, I live in New York.
I thought- Okay.
Mhm.
Okay, no, I thought that it was snowing in New York, that's why it was that you were asking.
You speak very quickly.
Oh, sorry.
Where- where, ah, where, am? You are what, what Honduras?
No, no, eh, my parents are from, em, the Dominican Republic,
Oh.
but I was born in Puerto Rico,
Oh, your, your mother is Dominican?
and my father too.
Oh, why is that? Here in New York, there are many Dominicans.
And Puerto Rican, too.
In- in- yes. Many Puerto Rican, and many Dominican. I lived in the Bronx.
Mhm.
And, they have it, the people in the Bronx have a lot of poverty, you know.  But, all, all, you know.  What about it, what about it?
All the Dominicans, and, and the blacks also.  So, it has blacks, Dominicans, oh, Mexicans.
sure
In the Bronx, and, Puerto Ricans, and Haiti, Haitians
Sure, from Haiti
You know?
Yes, from Haiti.
Me?
From Haiti.
Yes, Haiti, yes.  An what else?  Sure, Jamaica, Jamaicans.
From Jamaica.
Sure.  So, folks are poor.  They don't have much money, there in the Bronx.  You know?  Do you have much money?  Do you have a lot of pesos?
I don't think so.  I mean we have a house, but my husband is the only one who works.  And we have, it's that, you know,
Yes
No, we don't have a luxurious life.
Sure.
We have enough money for what we need to buy, food, Pampers,
Sure.
You know, to pay the, the, the, electricity, or whatever else.  But we don't have, we don't have anything for vacations, you know, none of that.
Yes.
We have what we need. But,
Oh.
you now, and we still have a car, we don't need two cars. And, normally, people have
Aha.
two cars.
Oh, and you don't have two cars?
No. No, we have just one car.
Oh, But, you live in a big house or a small, or what?
No, we don't have a house, for around here, it's a rather small house.
Oh.
Oh, we have three bedrooms.
Oh.
and two bathrooms. It's not even that big. And, and here the houses, they are very, very, expensive, very expensive.
Oh, yeah, yes.
And that, you know, what we, if we have it's because we need it.
Yeah
But, it's not a luxurious lifestyle.
Wow. And?
And, we don't know, you know, we're not starving, and we have clothes
Yes.
but since I don't work, I stay with my, my girl,
yes.
it is hard to us.
and that of, that of clothes is also very expensive, the clothes?
Am, I think so. We, you see, I, I haven't bought any clothes for a year now. I've bought things for the girl but I buy them at a consignment chop
Yes.
Yes, you know, we save a lot of money that way. But, I don't go shopping, I don't do lots of, you know, I don't
Yes.
go shopping because clothes are quite expensive.
Yes.
So if we buy clothes, we go to places like Costco
Oh,
or Sams, or something like that.
Yes.
and we see if it fits, if it's useful and we buy it there.
Oh.
But, me, shopping, no. I don't do that. What,
Oh, my goo-
you know. I don't care about you know, to me, yes, yes I have clothes to wear but I don't care about designers or the,
whatever.
Yes.
That is not dirty, that is not
Yeah

A rest, ah
How are you?
Well, well, you work in construction, you had told me, no?
Yes.
Yes, oh, well, yes.  Ah mm.  Yes, then we have to talk about traveling.  Where do you travel?
Mm, the, the, the best I could do one, no?
Yeah, sure, go on vacation.
Oh, yes, to Mexico.
Right
Only to Mexico, and here, here in the United States, I've been to different places
Oh, uh, to
Uh, on vacations, not from work, on vacations
But, right
Uh
¿Where have you been in the United States?
In Texas
Right
When i was in Texas i traveled from here to there
Um
I have family here and there
Oh
Now that I'm living here i travel to, i travel there or to Nebraska, with my brothers, my brother who's there.
Um
I also have family in Arizona, all my uncles.
Right
All, uh, almost all the family on my mother's side is here in the United States.
Oh.
further that in different states, or I do have on in Wisconsin, where I also sometimes stay
Mm.
I will look closely at that
Mhm.
and then what did you say?  For traveling when you have time I like to go by car, driving like this.
Aha.
because you can go when you want to and stop to rest when you want
Cla-
well with the family, you have to stop and rest
Mhm.
if you go by bus anymore you will only stop once and it is very uncomfortable.
Mhm.
And so nothing more.
But, oh, and when you've gone to Arizona, you've gone to, to visit some tourist sites only, to visit the
Ah, Grand Canyon
Yes, you went to the Grand Canyon.
Yes.
Aha.  And did you like it?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Yes, yes.
It's nice, even though in itself, it is very much like a desert.
Sure, yes.
But it does have lots of pretty things.
Uhm. When in Mexico have you gone only to visit your family or other places, also?
Then I have family in two states, in Durango and in Monterrey.
Yeah.
Ah, Monterrey then have lots of ah, is like, how would I say it, they have lots of tourist areas, to visit, eh, to get to know
Uhm.
ah it's an industrial city, then there are many, what can say? there are thing you can do, and they are things you can't, they are not too many things but it is pretty.
Uhm.
It has two, I am not sure if they are exactly rives, one is called horsetail
Uhm.
they are towering, like enormous waterfalls
Uhm.
that o-, that one is also visited by lots people from other areas
Uhm.
It is pretty.
Would you to visit some other country?
Oh yes, I would love to visit Alaska.
Alaska?
Yes.
Hmm.
Go to, to know what the is
It is too cold there
ehm, what the, exactly to what cold really is
Hmm
I would like to be there.
Yes, my ehm, the boss I had before, went to Antarctica, that is the south pole.
Yes
Yes, to see the penguins.  Because penguins are only on the south pole
Yes.
and eh, and he loved it there are cruises that you can take to go to Alaska you take them from California and they take you to Alaska
Yes, yes known something
and then you get to see all of the glaciers and all the Hmm
Yes, yes, I yes I would like somewhat to get to know around there
Hmm
but sometimes there is no time.
Oh, yes, no.
And when
It takes time and money.
when you have time sometimes you don't have money
Yes. Yes, it is difficult, no, it is, it is I like
What, what happens is
Aha
how? Yes, tell me.
No, no, tell me what you were going to
Oh, what happens is that, I tell you, as when one has vacations, one, well, at least I, ah, and I try to
to go out but go where my family is, go and visit family some times ah
Of course, mmh
hard, two or three years without seeing them
Mmh
you have one opportunity well I prefer well of course, to see my family than, going on vacation also well I don't know
Mmh.
Eh, we like we are very very close, we see each other a lot
Yes
and well better, there are times that we go out we make plans to better go see family
Of course.  Yes, it is difficult to balance visiting family and going on vacation especially when you get married because then you have to go visit your family and the
family of the wife or the husband
Oh, speaking of which, that is another problem
then there was just time and and vacations and the money and everything is going at it.
Yes, it is rather the time because, ah, I'll tell you that money does not spend much, when you go to see family and do not spend much when you go to
yes, yes.
no, you're going for a walk, to know different ah, city or country
Mhm.
there if you spend more because you have to spend hotels, food
Mhm. Yes, of course.
Logically, you know, wherever you walk you're going to spend money
Mhm.
to get away with, to visit family if you spend, do not say no, but
Mhm.
not spend much
Yes, of course.
it's very different
Yes. Yes, I love traveling, I hope now that I start working on aa nurse and I started to have money to travel
That's good.
for, wherever you go, but if, uh, I've been in Europe, and have been in Costa Rica and Guatemala have been in Mexico but only in Mexico City
Puerto Vallarta and Chiapas
Oh, really?
Ah, I was in St. Kitts and uh oh, where else was in Chiapas? In eh I do not remember. But Oh, and I was in Taxco ah well, when I
Oh, Taxco
yes, when I went to Mexico.
on holidays?
Ah. Yes, yes, I've got a friend that loves to travel, she loves to travel and stay for quite sometime in other countries, she has just returned from spending two years living in
Taiwan, I went to visit her in Mexico, she had been there for six months because she was traveling through the country
so I went to visit her when she was in Chiapas and from there we went to San Cristobal, Oaxaca, Taxco and then we came back, ah, o
I came back, she stayed.
Yes, my vacations.
Ah, from Mexico City. Well, she was studying
Oh.
she was studying so, eh, what she did was that she took some classes on her own and so while she was studying she was traveling throughout the country.
Mm, that's good.
Yes, yes, so, ah, ah, I've traveled with her ten times, I haven't spent that much money cause we stayed in hostels, I don't remember how you call those
but I mean, you can stay there and you get to sleep in a room with lots of people, but you pay almost nothing, we paid
like two or three dollars per night
Mm.
most of them are students, so you share a room with people you don't know but
But, since they are staying there, at least you know you are among people, there's no, there's no danger, in that
no, it's people that
they are, they are
its doing the same to
oh exactly, the people is doing the same
they come to travel yes, and they want to spend few money so stay like that good, but also i was to Europe and i stay a month too
traveling for europe, that come out very expensive but my parents help me because it was my gift for the university graduation so after i was here in houston
i only went to aruba its in the north cost of Venezuela
OK
OK and  its a little island like Puerto rico but i don't like it, its a place very famous and tourist in the caribean, but i dont like it
because Puerto rico its also an island and puerto rico has more green places and there are mountains and this little island is very desertic there isn't nothing
absolutely nothing its the only one in the beaches they are very nice but beside that there is nothing else to see
is desertic there?
in aruba yes
yes
yes its very dry there is absolutely nothing there is very flat there are stones that's all rocky
in the beaches are rocks
yes
yes the sand is white and the water is very clear you can see through the water is clear blue
look
but there isn't nothing else to see absolutely nothing
mmm
so i don't like but i have lucky that all my family is in Puerto rico except for a sister that lives in Florida
the, the rest are in Puerto Rico but even then like that, and now, for example, this year I went to see my sister in Florida and then in, in August
and then I went to Puerto Rico to see my family and now in December I go to Canada to see my boyfriend's family
then I no longer have time or money to go anywhere else
Well yes
because these are, these are three trips, three flights I mean, no, I don't have any money to go anywhere then I think that after I finish school I am going to take a
a vacation of free time before starting to, to work for
to rest
Yes, or to, and to go somewhere where I want to go, a different place, not not to see family
Well that is good, because starting to work you are going to be starting you don't exactly know how you are going to have, well practically your life rhythm is going to change, no?
Mmh.  Yes. Yes, and that usually when you start working they don't let you take vacation for a while ah
Mmh
there are places where the first three months you cannot take vacation in others the first six months you can not take vacation.
See
then, yes, how is your baby?
Oh, very well, thank you
Yes, yes.  Growing up.
Yes, he is good, growing, growing since the day he was born he was born on Wednesday, on Saturday he had an appointment with the pediatrician, we took him
Aha. Aha. Aha
and he had gained almost a pound
Aha.
ah, the doctor was chatting with is, right? I was there ah I was there a while talking with him, he was telling is that everything was going very very well that she had put on so much weight because a lot of children
when they're born normally they tend to slim down a little bit, to lose weight
Mhm.
and, and this girl didn't lose anything, and she actually did the opposite and gained weight
Aha.
that's great.
Yes.
Mm, well I hope that everything continues to go well, and there's no problems.
Yes Yes, yes, but rather that, in the beginning they grow so fast.
Yeah.
really quick yes, until they're like two years old, afterwards, they begin to not, like will, still kind of continuing to gro-
Betsy, yeap, oh Hi Alex
Ah, Betsy, you are speaking with Alex again, how are you?
good thanks, and you? that's great, mhm
good, yes well the topics is trips
something interesting
yes, something interesting.
Better than poli-, than politics, so what ever it is
yes, I have had many different oppitions
yeah
well, do you want to start this time.
Sure, okay, ah well, yes, if not, if you had money, a bunch of money and, and, all the time, I would like to go to Hawaii at least two months
I say
and why?
Because, I have never been there, and the grand, my husbands grandmother says it is very beautiful over there, because she goes there very frequently, and I would also like to go in a cruise.
Is your husband Canadian?
yes, yes, he is
yes, a cruise would be fantastic
yeah, a cruise because I have never been, I have never been in one before, and you?
well, me, once I traveled to Spain
yeah
and to Jibrartal and I liked it a lot, but the southern part of Spain where the beaches are
ah ya
eh the landscape was very nice
mhm
but I didn't have the money to stay for too long
mhm
and that always caused me frustration and so If I were to win a prize and had the money
mhm, yes
and also the time and of course when you have money you must have time
yeah
and so I would love to travel to Spain and visit the
ah, yeah
there are many castles and interesting things over there
aha
ah, many things from the the old world, many roman things ah it's interesting, it's it's to know history
mhm
and but you need money, it's it's an expensive country specially for touring
aha
and it is not no very dangerous, where I'm from, Colombia, it's very dangerous
aha
You don't enjoy there although it is a beautiful country but
mhm
You are always afraid about the country security
yeah
No, Spain is better,
oh okay well if there were not too many wars I would like to go to Israel
dangerous
yes but not, if there were not wars
yes
There was where I would like to go
Colombia is also a fantastic country is there were no wars and
okay
you have some terrific landscapes and montains
I can imagine, okay
yes and we also have coast there but the problem is the war yet and the
mhm
and oh the drug dealers that has totally damaged that country and I figure up the thinking you have is terrible
okay
yes oh what else, what do you like to travel inside United States or inside Canada
in Canada, oh I would like to go to Montreal
yes they have told me that it is beautiful but cold
now here where we live now ehm winter is just rain
yes
where we lived before winter was a lot of snow and it was super cold
where do you live?
in the, close to Vancouver
there is no snow?
no
impossible
not now because we are close to the, we are now close to the sea
you are way to the north it never snows?
well, it falls sometimes but the next day it is gone
yes
and it doesn't freeze, no no ehm
because here in los Angeles it never snows unless one goes to the mountains
aha I see here as well, it falls it falls here
yes
hmm I couldn't say for sure one time in three months or something like that, maybe, yeah about snowing
but if it falls it must fall because you are way to the north Betsy
yes
yes, you are close to Alaska
yes but it is, it is kind of far, it is ah next to the Pacific
yes near Seattle, Washington
OK, aha
do you know Seattle, Washington?
Well not too much, no
I would like to know around there
OK
yes and also Washington, DC one time I went to the capital
Mmh, mmh
It has beautiful things, museums, history I like all that has to do with history and a classic city is Montreal, Canada
mmh, it has been two years already
they say that Canada is very pretty
ah, OK and if you like winter, I mean snow
and no, there is not insecurity like here in the United States
no, at least I have not seen anything that ugly
here in the United States it is ugly
yes, can you imagine
it is almost, almost like Latin countries now
mmh
Yes, that's why they criticise immigration a lot here because a lot of the migration here is bad.
Yeah.
and has damaged the country a great deal
Uh huh
Through the years I have seen that this country has really deteriorated and now in the United States there is a big difference between rich and poor.
Uh huh.
that wasn't the case before. In Canada I believe it's more balanced
Hmm
There, there isn't such a big difference betwen rich and poor in Canada as there is here in the United States
Here there is a ton of poor people.
But there are more social programs there
Well yes, that's true.
And there there are not so many people, the problem here is that there are a lot of people
Hmm, yeah
Yes, the country has been unfortunately going downhill quite a bit
two years ago we went to Florida, Florida
yes, it's dangerous there.
Yeah.
They can rob you, they can do something to you, there's a lot of misery. It's almost like a Latin country. No, I see a big difference there.
Uh huh
yes and you know the Latin countries are known for the difference of the poor and the rich
Yes is true
and that's becoming, that's how the United States is becoming
mm
yes, but there are interesting things and once I went to Texas and I liked the scenery,
aha
I've always liked the Colombian plains
super hot
super hot but very beautiful
yes
and the Texan plains are similar, a bit more developed and oh I love the barbequed meat
oh yes
and a lot of barbeque meat was being bought in those places
yes
is interesting I would like to get to know Texas more
aha
for its scenery, most of all for its plains, I love the plains the prairies the cowboys I like
the horses
and the barbeques
yes, mm
I love barbecues like they say in Colombia the barbecues
ya
and that is found a lot in Texas
ah how nice, m
yes, yes I think that it is one of the most interesting parts of the United States and Seattle I would like to get to know for its coffee, they say that there is good coffee there
really? that I-, that I didn't know, m
yes yes
now well my parents are going to el Salvador in November for two months
over there there are volcanoes, yes
oh yeah yeah
yes I remember and there must be pretty landscapes around there
yes yes there is or yeah there are but again the poor people and
there's security
and there's almost no work, yes
yes that is the problem of all of the Latin countries that that have never been able to overcome
yeah it's true, mhm
yes hopefully one day they'll be able to do it L
yeah some day yeah
yes yes but and I have heard that the countries there are pretty because there are a lot of volcanoes
and if it had yes, mhm yes there is yeah
and mountains, do you know El Salvador's beaches?, how are they?
they are really nice, one is called liberty, and there is another with a lot of swimming pools and there are really "huge waves" in the sea
what are "huge waves"?, waves or something?
Wave
because here is both the Pacific and the Atlantic
Oh waves only from the Pacific, I thing only the Pacific
How many coast do you have? only Pacific?
Yes, like here
Yes
because Florida only has an Atlantic coast
yes
Mm
because Colombia has both the Atlantic and the Pacific, Colombia has 2 coasts
Oh
That's ways is a nice country. I tell you, Colombia overpasses a lot of countries in beauty
I imagine
As a country is the worst, but as in beauty, it has a lot of it
OK
it has a lot of queens
Oh, the queen is nice, cocaine no!
But there's a lot of bad stuff
yes, yes, that's true
yes there is a lot of stuff, i don't deny it, no one can denied the truth
yes
from a situation, there are wrong things.
i can imagine
and more than that, there is insecurity eh
mhm...
and when you are a tourist, you don't want to go some place where can happen something wrong
mhm, that's true, yes
right?, you want to travel some place where there is not a lot of insecurity
mhm
but i have to tell you something is going to terrify you
what is it?
i never was robbed in Colombia
is that true?
let me tell you, i was robbed once in Spain
really?
yes, ma'amm, that's true
very strange
They robbed me in a subway train
Ah
And they took my purse
Oh no
and they stole like, I don't know, 100 dollars
Wow, and this was in Spain
Yes, or perhaps, more. What? In Spain
In Spain not Colombia
And in Colombia where, where, they are very famous for these things of
yeah, yes
pickpocketing never happened to me because that's one of the reasons I'm always alert
yeah
and in Spain when you're alert
yeah, hmm, it's true, hmm
yes yes, and and you know, a little while ago there was a terrorist attack there
in Spain?
yes, some trains exploded, they put bombs in them, and there were some people, they were Arab terrorists
yeah, oh, in Spain, really?
and people died in Spain and this happened in the stations I frequented
oh, yeah, yeah
Some years ago I was in the places where the attacks happened
and this happened recently?
Like a year ago
oh
yes, then, well, you know, if something bad is going to happen to you
hmmm
then something bad will happen to you, no matter where you are
it's true, yes, hmm
Good night, I'm Joe.
Hi, hello, good night. Where are you from?
I'm from Colorado.
From Colorado, and where were you born?
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Ah, I'm, I'm now in Idaho and I'm originally from Chile.
From Chile, good, how long have you been here?
am, here in the States, ten years and three years in Idaho
Ten years, oh, and do you like it here? Do you miss your home country a lot?
yes, very much, it's a bit like Colorado, no, Colorado has lots of snow
And does it change often, this season, does it change
Sure.
is it only hot or hot to cold?
Sure, and in Puerto Rico is not like that, righ
now, Puerto Rico, it's kind of the same weather all year long, but yes, it does have some rainy times and also sunny times during the year like,
in July, we can have lots of sun and lots of rain in May.
oh, but no snow, like,
Oh, no, never, no
How long have you lived there?
Oh, I have a lot of years living here, more than twenty.
Oh a lotm, and by, ah, because we are speaking of travelin, Have you traveled to Puerto Rico?
Well look that, since the, ninety three since my parents died it was the last time I went to Puerto Rico. But I had traveled to other parts, I went to Mexico.
I also went to other parts, to parts of the United States also including Florida that is a
Oh yes
one of my favorite places
Then ah, you had not lived always in Colorado, you traveled, or you travel only for vacations and no more
For vacations to other states, there is a lot to see, I don't know if you had the chance to see other parts of the United States
There are lots of very nice parts
Oh no yet, not a lot yet, only Utah, and I don't know, Utah and nothing, the truth is not, I wente to Washington
Washington State, it is very beautiful there
To Washington, Sure, but no, no by, by this, sure, someday I hope I can, no
and How you came to Idaho to stay?
Oh to study
ah
We came after my graduation from, fro school, to study college here
yeah
Well, I went to Utah, and I met my husband there and now we are living in Idaho
Very good
Well, we went back to Chile only once five years ago and,
And
we hope to be able to go back now, you know, maybe next year
is it very difficult to go there from here, with the passports and things like that?
Not so much, it's more expensive from Idaho, I think that if we were in Florida, or California, I, Colorado is on the north, right?
Sure, it's more or less at the center, we're lower than you
At the center. Ah, okay, then it's like lower but to the center
yes, it's a centric place for flights, from here there are a lot of flights to South America, too
then it's a little easier for you to travel
yes, for example, if I wanted to go to Cancun on vacation
yeah
and I went there three days with 350 dollars
ah, no, really
that would include hotel and flight, yes
Oh, yes, that's why we don't go anywhere, because, just, anything will be like 300 dollars or so. By ticket, it's very expensive
It probably would be easier for you to go to the state of Washington. Or go to a more centric place and fly wherever you wanted from there
yes. And have you been outside of America, like Europe or something like that, or you haven't had the chance?
No, I'd love to go to Europe. My brothers that, one lives in Wichita Kansas and the other lives in Puerto Rico, they travel a lot
Ah, yes
They've been all over Europe, and they've told how nice it is over there, Paris, Spain
What country, what country would you like to visit if you could?
I'd like, one of my favorites is Australia
Oh yes, to Australia.
yes and I would love Australia because is very exotic over there and also New Zealand. But I would also love to visit Italy, Spain, France, all those places, but I think that Australia still remains number one for me.
yes Look, yes for me, if I could choose, I think it would be Italy.
Italy yes, Italy is beautiful.
yes, I don't know,I think that Italy. But Australia, is huge, Australia, there's so much to do.
Is a lot of history, yes, well I, worked for a company that the president and owner of the company, was Australian, so there we formed a good friendship and all that.
And he always would invite to go over there, but I have a five year old daughter, I'm a divorced father.
oh,
And I have joint custody.
And sure.
so,
oh, so you're going to be,
I would never abandon, never leave her behind.
of course. At least for another fifteen years, no.
yes, yes, when she forgets she has a dad, and starts thinking more in the boyfriends, yes
Of course when she doesn't want anything more to do with you, for a while, no
yes yes but for now, I'm crazy about her and she's crazy about me and,
Of course, no now is hard.
we have a really good time.
Yes we have small children also, and that makes it so hard to be able to travel anywhere.
Yes, exactly.  Well, I want to go to Puerto Rico next year so that she knows the Puerto Rican side of her family, because her mother is Mexican.
Clearly.
Then, I want her to know that, and she is crazy about going and seeing her grandmother.  Her grandmother comes here every year, and they get along well.  Those two have great chemistry.
Ah, then you are going to take her there, but more or less at what age are you thinking of taking her.
She, well, she has traveled many times in a plane.
Sure.
She's traveled more than me in the last three years because she goes to Mexico, with her mother, at least twice a year.
Wow, then it's constantly.
Oh, she is well accustomed to traveling, and is very calm, from what I told you about the first time that we traveled.  Well, it was not, it was not in a plane, but when I took a trip to Wichita.
sure.
I took one of these Greyhound buses, and it was an awful experience because she was still very little.  And when we got up in the bus,
Sure,
She was sleeping, but when she woke up she completely panicked
I can imagine
I think that she thought that she had one of the worst nightmares.  And the people there were very uncomfortable, and they said things to me.
Sure.
And it was a rather lousy trip, but
Oh, yes, I imagine.  How old was she?
She was around two years old then.
Oh, very little, she did not understand yet, clearly.
yes and I promised her that I would never take her again in a guagua there, we call it guagua.
yeah
then, the next time we went on a plane, a small plane and we had a great time and he was happy, and not to mention it was alone only.
one hour of travel compared to thirteen hours when we take the bus
ah yes that is it.
yes
No but it is good that you like to travel because,then she will want to travel because there is people that really do not like to travel and I can not believe
it was horrible
that you do not like to travel
I would love to see all the planet if I could.
sure.
Because I WOULD LOVE to travel as much as I can but in reality the situation I see it very difficult.
sure one has to be responsible and since we have children.
yes exactly
have your feet on the land for A while.
yes exactly, yes but have yes they have an opportunity to go to other places, come to Colorado it is beautiful.
I heard it is super slow.
is beautiful you live here.
many forest, no.
there are lots of national forests, they have majestic mountains they have attractions in town, they have all a little there is a lot of things but you leave here and you do in the mountains and you see places that are fabulous and the beauty is like if you were in paridise.
And how many years have you lived in Colorado?
I have been living here for twenty-six years.
Wow
In December I will be twenty-six, yes. Well yes, I came straight well I went for a small time to New York but only for a small amount of time.
Mhm.
So I came here with my ex- my first wife.
Mhm
Then we were married for about ten years, and then we both went our separate ways.
Ah, and she was American or, Where was she from?
But sh-she is half Puerto Rican and half Russian.
Ah,
She was, was my high school sweetheart
Oh yea,
Yes well we get a long well, and we ended well we just found out that we both had different goals in the end.
Clearly, well it's because we don't change much, right.
Changed a lot, yes, yes.
In those years.
The mother of the girl, well that was a really short marriage.
Clearly.
It didn't even last two years.
a yes oh, and that one, she is from Mexico.
Yes she is from Oaxaca Mexico.
aha
Well we have a good parental relationship with the girl.  We work very well with her.  In fact. today we went to her Kindergarten school
Mmh.
then to see what the teacher told us, and the teacher gave a, god report about the girl, because my girl is a very good girl, she has a good heart, and
has such a sweet voice that everybody likes.
How weird, no yes, she is cute.
She has.  She behaves very well, she is very respectful, she is a, she has much love for God and she has, she has you know, good principles and very hungry to learn.
where does she live?
in, my ex-wife you say?
aha, with the girl.
she lives very close to here, I live in Aurora, Colorado and she lives like three miles from here
ah, then you can see her often.
yes I see her three times a week every week.  More in other activities like today for example, well,
ah, how cool.
we share together with her.
look how great.
yes that is good
And it is going to be nice, now when, if you are from Puerto Rico you have no travel to enter and exit the United States, right.
Not at all.
I have never understood that, what, what, what role the United States has with Puerto Rico, because it is not a state, it is a separate country, but at the same time
Well it was invaded by the Americans, in eight hundred ninety-eight.
aha
they took it from the Spanish from there they established, American governors, and from there well they weri under submission until they started to gov- to put Puerto Rican governors,
like in one thousand nine hundred fifty, fifty-four, they gave citizenship to all the Puerto Ricans.
oh, not that much time
But Puerto Rico, it hasn't it hasn't been that long.  For example when my parents were born they weren't citizens, but I have been a citizen my whole life
sure
and, then well from there on well the commonwealth was established which is one, free association with the United States but without being a state
over there they vote for the primaries, over there they vote the primary for the president from here, but they don't vote for the elections for president from here.
So in some way it is independent, in some way they have a lot of
oh
Ti, dependence or union with the United States, it would be very difficult, that Puerto Rico would become a totally independent country because,
independent.
it would have to be approved first over there and they have never approbed it, and they haven't approbed either
Good night Mildred from Connecticut
Hi, How are you?, What's your name?
Mildred
Mildred, This is Arturo
And Where are you from Arturo?
I'm from Mexico, but right now I'm at Philadelphia
Oh I see, we have talked before, right?
It might be
I'm sorry
It might be, Where are you from? from Puerto Rico?
Yes
Oh, I have talked to you
Puerto Rican
I talked about..I don't really..but right now it's about music
Yes, today's topic is music
Yes, music is really nice
Do you like it?
Yes, a lot
Mmm
Do you play any instrument?
What type of music do you listen to?
Well all types,eh music this a little bit of jazz,clasic music and also i listen to a lot like I don't know contemporary music just like alternatives and fusions like that
fusion from jazz with funk
Rock and all that,ah
a little of everything what do you listen
regueton and all that
no,do you like regueton?
Ah.
Do you like regueton?
yes me yes,I listen to everything Regueton,Rap and all
yes yeah
Rock,do not-lik-I listen but don't like for a long time for little while okay but all night listening to rock,no
I am not much of a Rocker
No I am am I am very Rocker
But the Bachata,merengue salsa all music, classic music.
yes
Romantic music.nice yes I believe that music makes people be recognized, it lets you recognize people from all different country's
yes,yes, but
And
lately I believe this also is lost as well because the music now is made mainstream an example hip hop that today everyone is making the same music.
In United States, in Mexico, in everything, is an imitation and nothing else is taking like or is has convert in a global type
In the world, the, the heard I think yes to me I don't like it, but I am affected how the whole world is adapting to hip hop
inside the music, I thikn is like the regueton is doing a lot
ahh, ahh
In Mexico, the Mexican music is using lots the hip hop there is more like bandas of rock that are using hip hop or something like that
I think that united people, Although there are different nacionalities, there are people from Mexico that like the salsa, there are people
yes
from other countries that like salsa, the merengue yes, yes the bachata, when you go to the dance
yes, yes
ai
yes I like to dance a lot the merensge and salsa also
they are differente countries dancing
yes
I like a lot the mexica music also because it has beat specially the rancheras I love them, yes
yes, the rancheras
I like it a lot
yes there a good I like them too but I think is like good to know music from other countries like
ah had you heard music from Arab or Turk sometime
yes, ahh
interesting, isn't good also
Yeah, very nice, very nice, and Chinese too, chinese music.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, i mean, specially if you could play, well it would be even more beautiful, because they almost always, uh, they present like a story when they do shows, about them with the women that are waving their hands
Yeah, and their fans.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They use it for like, for like telling a story.
Right, well, everybody kind of tells a story with music too, i mean, in every way, music that has no lyrics, well, it's also telling, it's kinda painting a picture, i mean, like
a stage like that, it has lyrics, well it's always talking about something or related to a feeling or a story. I mean, Mexican music, like corridos.
They're very known because they tell stories, right?, about different people, different things that have happened, but they're very particular stories, very good sometimes.
Yeah the, if we go back to previous times, the Indians made their, their
Yeah
their dances and all, and they were, and the, the slaves were the first ones that used music for, for like complaining, like to be able to say
Yeah
how wrong they were treated, with that they expressed all their, their
Oh
Their unhappiness.
Yes, yes, yes.
I think that music will always, for centuries and centuries, and it will go on, you know.
Sure
even if it's different, at the, about the type they choose, it's always going to unite people wherever you go, because you know reggaeton and you already know who it was, and sometimes
yes ha
and don't know if you remember there was a band of Japanese guys, the light band
aha
they started to perform salsa
no, almost
yes, they were Japanese and they had spent a lot of time here i don't know what the finally did but they performed in New York, they had some original discs and they performed the
same salsa discs that they made before, sounded a bit Japanese too
Japanese girls oh
then I'm sure that if a Japanese would come here in America, would say, i heard that song before
no , never listen to them
even i don't get what they're saying but,
right
mhm yeah i think that music is beautiful and relaxing
yes, that too
you listen when you relax
relaxing and a bit distracting
and i have discs of that Coquí of Puerto Rico and the recorded music it comes from the river
ah,
you can relax with that,
yes
when one wants to be calm at home one can put their candles those with scent and be relaxed That helps a lot
uh huh ah yes like only background sounds or that are
mhm yes And music is necessary, it's necessary because it is what maybe if we didn't have music people would be like a
even a little more aggressive too
yes, no well it's that music is
Because music calms him
also even the music that is too, eh, like aggressive it helps as relief, no, also music can be very important as well like for the liberation so like
there's a singer that is called there's music afrobid he's called Cela Kuti and this sir well in, he for for the civil war of, of, of Nigeria
he was really important because he with all his music. made the movements of the revolution, that is the people didn't didn't, didn't see him as a musician but more like a political leader.
uh huh
that, that through his music moved people. then when he put out new records
uhm
the, the military became furious and sometimes they I mean, he had a whole community of, like of practitioners with him, that had his same political philosophy
and they all lived together in communities and when he put out a record that was called Zombi which criticized the army, because they were well like a a puppet of the government that were
like killing people of their own race
oh
he all of this said it in his song and the military heard it and
yes almost always, how do you say it they extradite from the country, they they, vote
yes yes, they threw him out, him, well, they imprisoned him and hit him and burned all his house and all the
yes because it was protest music what they call, right
exactly, the music
in Puerto Rico they had the Topo, the Topo, and who else is it that sang protest music? Juan Manuel Serrat used to sing protest music. And sometimes when they had concerts, they didn't want to allow them, you know.
aha, yes of course
Because they sang the truth about the people.
yes it's yes
Against the governments and all that, they
people got agitated and the government doesn't like that
they tired to boycott them and that people wouldn't go
yes
but it's interesting because that tells stories,
yes, of course that's recorded in history as well, music always will reflect what people are living in that moment and what they are thinking
mhm, yeah, I think the same. I think that
yes, that's good
Like, I, I tell you I think that there's a big need for music
yes, always
It tells love stories, it tells of misfortunes, it tells about people's problems
yes
daily life is used for many things
yes, yes everything mhm yes, yes, yes I think that it's it's essential that the air I think we couldn't live without
Yeah. I think that, I love music. I think that when, when I play it, I clean the house quicker.
yes and you don't play music, don't play any instrument
no, look, I've always liked the piano, and my daughters took piano classes, but i never had the chance to to that my mom had the money to pay me classes of
yes
i really like the guitar and the harp.
ah, the harp
the harp is an, an instrument that isn't used a lot anymore, but i find that it has a beautiful music
yes, not so much, in fact i had a friend in school, that that she played the harp, very beautiful, yes
yes the harp is very beautiful. you know what i like as well, i love accordion music too
yes but yes, as you said the yes well the Mexican music uses the accordion a lot
aha sure in, in Puerto Rico they use it, the, the people of, of, of what we call of gicaro, from the fields. when they're going to do the parties on Christmas and that, then they use it
yes yes, yes
but you don't play any instrument
i do play this the guitar the bass and and well i tried for a while the piano, but it was very hard, i, i couldn't
well better that way
my boyfriend plays, my boyfriend plays the bass, he played it too because not anymore, he's old now not anymore
aha
but
yes
he played with bands and with orchestras, and he played the bass
it's always good to play music, i think
mhm
also it serves to unload, when I want to distract myself or something I take my bass and play a little.
Ok, it relaxes you.
I get distracted, if it relaxes me.
That is good.
Yes.
It is good. Here we have many.
mhm
because he, he does dj.
ah
he dos, Dj so there is music all over the house.
oh, okay
and every, he spends his time on the internet recording discs.
yes
y we do discs for people if they want to
yes
something we have done parties and we do it and he is the one that records an entire cd in person and we gift it to him
yes
yes
my father, yes my uncle does something like him, he is also like a dj
aha
but now he does not work much in that, he pretty much does the jo- other jb, but but he also records

Aha
it is a city also, and it is rather populated, but it doesn't have the high rise buildings of Denver
Ah, and a little quieter
I would not say it is more quiet, I would say that

And that's the biggest city. After that one I'd say would be Idaho, Idaho Falls but I consider it as a but town.
yes
Cause is not a city, cause there aren't any big buildings or things like that, or any buildings really,
yes
And so, is like the one round here, is a little big town. But umm,
And how about crime, how is it?
Oh nothing ever happens. People round here leave their doors open, the cars unlocked,
Ah that's awesome.
And
Oh, is not the same around here in Aurara
Of course is very quiet. Look, the news around here are boring, like nothing ever happens around here
if anything were to happen it'd be...
News aren't about crimes or anything like that.
...the news of the month, but nothing, absolutely nothing happens around here.
Wow, what a wonderful thing.
Sometimes its too quiet round here.
Well then I'm moving right now and I'll be your neighbor.
Yes, it is very quiet. And a lot of people live in the country. So yes, is very quiet.
Well is the very opposite of Denver.
eh yeah
and aurora. aurora
Like i say, its too much, it was too quiet, there's not much to do, i mean people that live here like things like, um
yeah
camping, and fishing, and go skiing, and
The people in Colorado as well, mm, we like going to the mountains to camp, and all that
Of course
But there's people from around the whole world here and
Of course
A lot of people that came here have brought bad things as well.
Of course
so, things happen, and people live with fear
Of course
I always live in fear with my daughter, because they always talk about it in the news that the talk about a crime in aurora
Of course
What, yeah, gun shots, what if they stole that, what if they run over a kid, and the driver left without telling anyone
Of course
Things like that
Like the city,
Sorry?
Us we lived in, when I lived in Chile, I lived in Santiago for a while, which is the capital
yes
and of course, is is different to live in the city. Or rather, you do not leave open doors. You, you don't trust in anyone, generally. And
and the cars, and the cars here, you leave a CD
of course
nothing like that because they break your window, to steal it
everything
the CD's and
yes, not every where but
I never leave anything that may call attenttion to my car.
Of course not, here is very peaceful. To me is very, very peaceful, but is fine, because since I have children, is good to raise children and all that
Oh, that's great. I dream of a place like that. The only thing that
for this reason
I have, I am divorced parent, my daughter
Of course
she and I have, um, or rather, my ex-wife and I have divided custody.
You must stay close of
yes, I, I, would never want to leave my girl behind. I want to be here with her until she grows up
Of course
and one day she said, oh daddy I will get married, and will forget me. I hope not, but I know that, that happens sometimes.
Well, a lot happens
yes
But, nothing, I would like to, yes, live in a quieter place. My brother lives in Kansas
Aha
and it's very quiet over there, too.
Sure, no.
The have festivals, people are more quiet, no.
A bit more relaxed.
Yes, there are many nice things here. Not everything here is, is ugly like that, but
Sure
it's that since there are so many people living and more people moving in, and the, and, and the city I mean, there are cities in Colorado that are gro- growing the fastest in all America,
Sure
In- eh, that also brings its problems.
yes, and that's what I miss. Because here there's not much to do. Apart from outdoors stuff, there's no opera here, there is no, eh, places to
the mall is very small, there are no places to visit, or, places, ballet, or, concerts and things like that. There are no such things here.
So one, in a more- city, you know, as I tell you, pulsy or City that is in Utah
yes
and, and, if you like to do things like that, go to concerts, or go to see you know an opera, a play, or anything like that, a show
there's no, there's no, you have to drive some four hours, three hours, to, to see something like that. There's not much going on here. The only thing that the Universities here have are little shows, and this like that, but
that's what you miss from the, from the city, no, that
Yes
That you can find this type of fun, but, at the same time it is
no here, but the opposite. Here they have the
with peace and all that. I liked that a lot, when we lived in Utah
Yes
In City it is like city that has everything that you want
Yes
and it's tranquil
And many parts here are tranquil. And here they have every type of attraction for the family
Clearly
For adults, for singles, everyone. In reality they have a lot of things here, in fact, where I work, it is a zone where there are many high tech companies
Yes
So, also, until the amphitheater there remains like a block of distance from where I work, and sometimes we hear the concerts from where we work
Clearly
From the building
Yes you see that, and I would like to be close to something like that, somethings that had activities and other things
Yes, or no, here the activities are not lacking. The only thing is sometimes, and particularly in the city where I live, there is a lot of crime. I would like
There are other parts here, the neighboring zones that are pretty peaceful and
Yes
and good neighborhood. Even though they have a lot of people, they take good care of each other. And like you say, they have open faces, and they don't have the fear that they will be robbed or anything like that.
Of course.
In this, it's, at least, it's a mix of the good and the bad.
Of course.
Listen, and the bad guys then are those who like to take advantage
Of course.
And you live with fear, and peacefully
Of course.
But the traffic is horrible, let me tell you.
Yes, I don't miss that.
It's, it's incredibly horrible. Because sometimes the taxi drivers... and in winter it's even worse. Because when they start to have all these accidents you can't move on the highway
Oh, the snow and ice and all of that. Oh.
It's terrible.
Oh, and that, it's nothing unusual
But I always dream like that with a tranquil little spot. One day I think, who knows, it will be possible. When, when
Good, if, well, when, when, and now where does your daughter live, she lives close by too, right?
She lives right close by. About one, no two miles from here.
Oh
In what used to be my house, uh huh. And also the house of my ex-wife, that was my house then, we both stayed there. At one time, we both were there
There, because the house has three stories
I see
and the, the basement , like isn't really a basement, the windows stayed up.
ha
so then, they went through the back part in the basement, like the bottom part, and they stole a bunch of things from her.
oh, they weren't there right?
no, she had left with some work, i went to the house, and examined, and i recommended her, that they had to bloc this, and that for
they shouldn't leave it in an open area, right
of course
so she did it that way, also in her car, at work, where she parks, in a non good place, and they've gotten her car like three times
oh that's bad
three times they've broke her crystals, they've stole her CDs the stereo.
that's horrible
yeah it is, that's the bad thing about living in the city, any kind of attractions, but there's also lots,
of course, you have to
disadvantages
you have to be careful.
i miss it.
of course, one relaxes here, and that's the problem, because we are missing who we get, you know the other side, and they take advantage of the circumstances, people that don't trust anyone.
exactly
and the relax and all that.
hey do you have
And,
sorry, continue.
Oh, for example when that happened, here it was big news, at least here of this, man that came and, and killed a family, and took two kids
Oh, I remember that.
yes, because, precisely, they live here in the country and the kids, I mean you never imagine that someone was going to come around these places, and
yes
and,
yes, crime can happen anywhere.
of course.
That's the sad thing, that you
And you always have to be careful, always.
yes, and not trust certain people so much, with strangers, specially.
Of course, so
I, I always, teach my daughter, not to trust strangers, and to be very careful.
yes, but you realize that when you have kids, you start with all those worries, oh, is terrible.
yes And you start teaching them no one can touch them here, and there, and
Of course, when you don't have kids, at least you take care of yourself, no. But
yes
when you have kids, and no.
Hi, good afternoon.
¿Hello?, good afternoon, ¿What?
Mayra speaking here.
Oh, Mayra, oh, ¿how's it going?, it's José
Memo. ¿Are you Memo?
¿Hello?, ¿Um?
¿Who are you?
It's José.
Oh, ¿again?
Yeah, again
¿How are you?
Fine, ¿and you?
Fine. ¿How's everything?, ¿how is school going?
oh, ok. Here, studying a, a bit, and well, i got a call, and i say, ¿why not?, why don't i take a rest, ¿right?
Good.
And, ¿how are you?, ¿how's school going?
¿Me?, fine. Everything's cool, uh, with, I've finished all exams, well, you see, I'm in that week in which you just, you can't do anything.
Uh um, uh um.
And, well, just the weather, I'm telling you, i can't get used to it. It makes me cranky
Oh, no.
I swear that in the morning I will turn to the window and I get, get mad, oh, again.
No, but, but, where are you? or where do you live?
Oh, I am at the high-rises, yeah,
Oh, before coming here.
yes, where?
Oh, before coming to study here?
No, no, no, no. I lived before coming here, I lived in, I lived in Singapore for two years. And before that my life had been in Mexico City, all my life
Oh, Oh, so then there is
yes,
yes, it is very hot. Or there is much more hotter than here
yes, well yes. I already used to the, the tropics
It is very hot in Singapore, right?
S then, is tropic, really, nothing more then,
yes
yes, I arrived there and yes it was like today, what is happening?
oh, and so then, here it's, it's cold and
yes,
uh,
And in the air that has been a week, and I don't understand how this can survive
no, it's cold, and yes, yes, there is no sun.  Oh, yes, I know, no well, the summer feel good. But, one, one week like this, of, of a bit of cold and of
like that, uh, ah, not much. I like it but still, yes, I know that it's just the beginning, you know, of a horrible winter.
yes.
So, ah, that's what I hate about it, but
yes, yes, yes. The cold, you can stand it but until December, once Christmas is over, what happens is that
when you come back, you feel like, oh well, now Christmas is over and you think that the cold is going to be over.
Uhum.
Cold weather is for Christmas and so you come back and it's just worse! That's when it hits me, and I'm like "oh no"
Ah.
go, go away please.
yes, I know, it's like, my brother is studying in Cornell, it's way up to the North and it's about six hours away from Philadelphia but it's
much more high up to the North
yes.
and they begin classes until the end of January, around the twenty eight of January or
Oh, really?
yes, yes, that's because the weather is terrible, so, they move the calendar and they go to classes way into May and they rest in the early days of January, right? The students, because it's
Oh, aha.
brutal, the weather there in Cornell. Philadelphia's weather it's not that bad, correct? Cornell's is, it's just too much.
Oh, you can't
My brother.
And I was thinking about going there but I didn't. That was great because I wouldn't have survived, I swear, I wouldn't survive in there
The truth is not that me and my brother had the luck, because um, that gave him a what they say one of the town houses
Aha.
but, it was much bigger, then we went in and saw the living room and kitchen, and then up one floor and there they had all their rooms but
it was quite large, but the problem is that they were one of the new dormitories at the university.
Ah.
and had built outside of the university, so I was very far from the university. And the classes
engineering was at the other end of the university.
Today, they're poor.
And, and said that he is oh and also, is that I say no, right? Then I say but I say ha, no, there is a bus system there of, of
there public transportation, why not use it? No I do not want to pay fifty dollars to use it.
Oh.
true then the last step and walking throughout the semester and in the winter, it wasn't twenty degrees and we began to walk forty minutes to get to class, it is
oh, that is my brother
Today, they poor.
No, that is not it.
He looks for it.
But why not, not if, it is cheap, right? I did not want to pay fifty dollars. Yes, is that this is ridiculous then
not because the bus only goes four times an hour, then do not want to wait fifteen minutes for such a thing.
Oh.
Oh, is that my brother, I don't know.
What grade is your brother in?
No,but um now he is in third grade.
Ah,O-K
yes,yes but
Is good
and ,and what do you think of, of crime here in Filadelf-?
Of what? Of crime?
Eh,of crime,yes
Here in Philly I have not been informed of much, or say I hear there are some persons whom they robbed at the forty and one or whatever,
Uhum.
But I believe I have always been very lucky, because I have been walking at night alone on forty and one and I like to go to the store of
To the stores of fruites at the forty and eight and when I want I go there and nothing has ever happened to me.
And you walk to the forty and eight?
yes. I myself also And like that enchanted life, also or is don't don't think that I put attention I am not scared or anything.
Oh.
and nothing has ever happened to me and I have never had a reason to get scared or anything and nothing on the contrary everyone is super nice when I go there.
Then, I don't I believe that
yes,yes
I believe that i'am lucky because in Mexico is the same Or is all my friends in Mexico have a history that they have been robbed or kidnapped or they have done something to them.
And nothing has ever happened to me, I am always by myself at the bad hours of the night in bad places and like that like that all things they say you are not supposed to do
hmm, hmm
I've done all of those at the same time and nothing has ever happened to me
to the
yes, yes i swear like that, that hmm i see what I've done, yes, i remember what i did, and how dared I?
what was I thinking? sure i was an irresponsible teenager but, well nothing ever happened to me
eh
then, i don't know, no, i don't necessarily feel so insecure, because of reasons. but you? you know Philly
hmm, well, i don't, well to me
oh, yeah, how is it?
for me is the, uh, with me it's almost the same story, right? because I've never never had anything happen to me here
here, near the university, i live in Walnut and 38, between, between, between 38 and 39
aham
then, it's not far and here there is a lot of security and then but in general i, i don't know anyone that, that has done anything, i mean seriously i think that
of course it happens, right? sometimes you see it on the newspaper and one
yes
but in general it's pretty occasional because in, in these areas there is so many security and ah they have cameras
yes, that too
and and lights, and they have those phones, and they have the people the, the, the policeman that ride on the bike that it's incredible what they, what they have
and they spend a lot of money, but also it- it's like in general, they keep it pre- pretty safe
yes, yes, there's a lot.
I can imagine that the people of the neighborhood know for example that there are criminals, correct? I know that here they need security and they have to be very careful.
and I often think ah mm that there can be crimes but there are those who do not although I think it is generally safe now
There is security in the quad because it used to not be as strict but now you have to go out there and give a person a card
and then it passed, what was it called e- this sysem to see if someone is really a student or not
They can't be false with the card and pass through right? But now
OK
but the thing is that when people left it was very easy to enter. But now they have this system with a new gate that..that
that you can't do anything right? Well in general they are very busy and the one at the university
yes
eh e-
yes in general, in Philadelphia there are still so many areas where you wouldn't want to go
yes
I don't like it or to be out at night like at the Center City there are some place that I don't like to walk.
No e-
But I don't know sometime because I don't know the city well, I think or I don't know the people here.
yes
Or when I was in Mexico if someone passed me or something I would go across the street
Mhm
And here is not like it at all and I don't know to to fear and who not to fear
yes, yes
Well, no, no no.
Well, Philadelphia has many dangerous neighborhoods because
yes.
e-, eh, they have, they are, they are and the neighborhood is fairly safe, right? so one has here, from the university that in general is also fairly safe but
s-, say if you go to, to to the North, like that in North Philly all of that and South Philly and West Philly and well it's not necessary but more
I mean, only that it's very, very dangerous. So, but also, all-, for example if you go out at night you're not going to go to North Philly to go out, so it's not so
so important, right?
Uhum.
so, well, for us
yes, also.
yes, because if, if on is going to go out, if on goes to Philadelphia, but if one's going to Old City but then in Old City there's so many people that goes out that there are many policemen there and everything
so
Listen, but little so you don't know anybody from Philly that has a history of a-, that they had stolen something from them.
yes, eh, yes, in general, well, also there are not so many students that go to Old City in general the students are, they stay here in, in the university.
Uhum. OK.
I think. Eh, yes, well in general. But people complain a lot that there is no security here that we're in a bad neighborhood and
in general it's, it's that that yes, yes every week one read the, the, the DP so there are, there are eh, once there
there was a, a mugging or whatever, so one goes, one thinks naturally that it's, it's happening a lot, right? but
Uhum.
in, in reality it's a-, one things maybe that they mug, or rob from I don't know two hundred students, but there are about twenty thousand students, and then the probability that the
That, happens to oneself
yes, that also too
of course it exist, right?, but it is not that high
Of course, besides, it's not that weird to happen when you are walking or in
yes yes
the 43th, that's how always occurs, but they can't also do that
Yes, that's why I think that it's better to live in something like the University high-rises , because, specially if you get home late at night
Yes, it's really quiet
Yes, well, it's nice to have
Don't worry about anything
to walk a long time, people lives like this in Baltimore, but the blocks in Baltimore are huge, they must to
Yes, and there is not light
Yes, huge, Huh?
And no light
yes, not light at all
In the blocks
Yes, not light al all, but in the high rises is better, is quiet and you don't have to buy all the forniture
Umm
if anything happens, you call the university and they take care
yes
but and, and one has to, also there are many and I heard about many stories of problems among people that, share an apartment
Hi
Hi, who an I speaking too?
Hi, I'm olaya, in Philadelphia
hi, I'm Arturo
are you Spanish?
no, no, I'm from Mexico
oh ok, that's great, where are you calling from?
From Philadelphia as well, of course, yeah
me too, good,
what are you doing in Philadelphia, working or studying?
I'm studying right now
oh, okay.
in, in UPENN, the unversity.
Oh me too.
Yeah, what do you do?
Yeah, chemistry engineering fro undergraduate
ha
and you?
I'm in the linguist program.
oh okay, so, you have something to do with this program?
No, I mean, I know the people who carry it, and I know the ~LDC and what they do.
Ah, OK.
But, no.
And for, and I, I mean, with what purpose are they doing that program, or what is it for
Well, the ~LDC what it does is collect many types of linguistic data, be it text, like tex- eh, the oral thing, and then, this can be used to, for many things, for, for example.
A-
ah, programs that, that can understand voice, need-, need some training, don't need
Ah, OK. Ah.
a sample, let's say.
OK, OK.
And, it is- then, mm, for example, for that you can and, and to study from how people pronounce a given letter, even dialogue, how it develops, I don't know, what, I mean, to,
Aha. Wow.
For many things.  And, the ~LDC, they do that, they collect data in many languages, and, and then, people,
Aha.
You can do more things, more practical or for more studies, more theoretical, no?
More specialized.
Mm, yes, yes.
Wow, OK, Listen, and this, where do you live here in Philadelphia, what neighborhood, or?
Well, I live in, in West Philly, but, well, not very, West, let's say, I live on forty-third and Spruce.
Ah, OK. Ah, well, yes, it is, it is, not too west, as you say.
No, not so west
yes, yes, I live on campus.
And, aha, aha.
But, I live up, on forty,
Mm.
in the high rises.
Mm. Mm.
And. How do you feel the ambiance there, living by forty three?
Well, the truth is I like it a lot. I mean, before I came,
yes?
they told me, well, and I read that Philadelphia was so dangerous and such, and
yes.
be careful with West Philly, in fact, in, in according to the guides, they put in the campus is dangerous going at night.
Aha
And, I, well, this is my second year here,
Mm.
and, the truth, is I've never seen anything, nor nothing has ever happened to me, nor do I feel unsafe, in general. I mean, maybe is because,
I don't know, I don't watch that much, either, don't watch the news here, that scare you a little
yes, that also.
And, and I don't know, nothing has ever happened to me, and no, I don't feel, I don't feel in danger, nor do I feel it is dangerous. But well, I know people, people that really are scared of West Philly, and
Yes, people, black people, no? it's like there's not many people that are intimidated by black people here.
Yes, but, well, mm,
E- for me,
that is his- that is his problem, no? that is, I don't know.
yes, of course, No, but it's like, like, like, many people associate I- West philly, with like, well, the neigborhood like the ghetto, no? like l- l-
Mhm, mhm.
the black neighborhood, and like, unsafe
Yes, Mhm, mhm, yes, that-
But,
N- I mean, tell me, tell me.
I mean, I, I don't feel that intimidated either or anything because I have a friend that lives near forty fifth,
Mhm.
and, and I walk that way very frequently. And, and at night too, and everything,
Mhm, mhm.
and e- and I meet with many people too, there, sometimes, at night, because I have to cross this, this park,
yes.
and, eh, and there is many people there, there is too, eh, at night, so, at two in the morning they're there partying, and, well, eh,
they have never threatened me, and neither, I mean, they never go any further than asking me for a cigarette or something like that, and that's it.
Mhm, mhm, mhm.
No, I mean, in, in truth, I don't I don't see that they are provoking, there, like
no. Let's see, it is true that things happen, I do, if I meet a girl who I'm attracted to, right?
Ah, okay.
But these things happen in all cities, don't they.
yes. All of them. yes, yes. yes.
And in all the cities there, there are crimes and I don't know, but I think here is,
yes, aha
He gives as much importance, and repeated a lot, right? and comes up on the TVs, and in the newspapers, and then creating a state just as well as a little collective,
yes, yes.
he's crazy, right?
yes, I think he is, As you say, and that this exaggerated. Then, as people, alone is the
yes
as the, the idea that this very insecure. But truth is not so much. I mean, no, it is rather the, idealization, and that they are thinking,
Mhm, mhm.
they are much more serious than it really is.
Mhm. And West Philly, I don't know, I think the neighborhood, there are not so nice areas, but it does has very nice areas that are very pleasant to walk through.
yes, yes.
And, I don't know, there are people who live in Center City and that never happens, right? To come here and stroll.
not really.
And, and I don't know, it seems to be a pleasant neighborhood to me, that's the truth
yes, I do not, I do not find it disgusting at all.
Mhm
Then, it isn't either singularly, or specially beautiful, or anything. But then, like, i mean, is, like you say, it has nice places where you can walk awhile, and
and, then, this, too, i say, like living here as a student, then, this, like, all the people is living here. Then, at the same time, like, then, they don't want to be too far from here, because, you are like disconnected from the university people. Then,
yes, yes, yes, mm
also, i think
yes
that's why the ones that live in the campus are more comfortable
MM, I, one time, i was walking until the street Sixty, or something like that. I started walking, and i went
Yeah, and ?
because i wanted to see what was there. And,
And what did you found ?
and, well, i found a normal neighborhood, a poor neighborhood, nothing like, an ugly suburb, with houses like they seemed old, or bad, not maintained. Like, that,
Aha
you would see poverty, in some places.
yes
But, but you couldn't see, something unpleasant, or something scary. Don't know, like, you saw
yes, no?
then, well, the wages in that neighborhood were , like, smaller than others, no ?
They get allot less, yes
And, clearly, also surprisingly you don't see white people on the street, that too
yes, yes, yes.
those are the things that have surprised me more about Philadelphia, right? The division, the huge division that exists between
yes, it's a huge displacement. I mean,
yes. Mhm.
I mean, it's impressive to see, the more you move to the west, well, the more black people you see, less white people live there.
Mhm, mhm, yes, really, sometimes, it's funny, mm, I, mm, ah, I take the bus in front of my house and sometimes, when I get on the buss, well everybody is black, then the colors start changing, right? as the bus moves on
yes, yes, yes.
moves on towards the east, and when you go to the west, it's the other way around, it's pretty
yes, yes, yes. That's true, I've only used the bus once. But, I do remember that, too, when I got on the bus, that I started to notice that
everybody was black when the bus was going to the west.
yes, yes, yes. It's funny.
yes, but, well, that's, that too, well, it's a consequence of the, I mean, the fact that most people, most black people, well, they are poor. So, well,
Sure, sure. It's related to their social class, right? It's not a racial thing, that's for sure, yes.
Sure, yes, more than anything, it's just that. But,
Where are you from, from Mexico?
Yes, from Mexico City.
They say it's dangerous there, right? Is it?
yes, yes, it's quite serious in there, this thing. I mean, it's not that bad, like, like, this, I mean, it's really bad.
mhm.
specially, there's still lots of separation between, social classes, it's pretty evident, I mean, it's
Right, Um, But-
I'm like, i have like a, a look more, um, let's say european. I'm, I'm blonde, i have white skin and color eyes.
Uh, um. Right.
And if i walk around some neighborhood, there in Mexico, that's kinda insecure
Right, um.
You bet i won't even get out of there with a wallet.
Wow
Or, i mean, but in, i, in, in one hour. I mean, they won't, they won't take long to get me.
Right, right, right.
And that's if they don't kidnap me. I mean, I'm more likely to be kidnaped.
I heard that too. I mean, kidnappings like that.
Yeah, it's impressive. Right now it's, it's interesting, because kidnaps, they can kidnap anyone. I mean, it's no longer because you're from a family
Right, right, right, yeah.
a rich one, no, anyone, they get him in a car, they take him away, and they call it "express kidnapping". So they, they, they take you away, and they get whatever they can from you. I mean, from a few
Wow
Thousand dollars, to, if you have much more, well, what, whatever you have. But, what you have. I mean, like that, these people
Right
is like, very desperat. So, uh, they do, they're brutal, really. And, it's
Right, right.
It's terrible. But, well, uh, but, well, really, i mean, lately, there's been much more social awareness towards, the, the citizens, i mean, now they're starting to, let's say, fight again'st that, ¿do you understand?, so
the prople declare the, the, this, the assualts, now people if they object
Mhm.
I mean, there has been much more, this, much more participation. Because, before it was like, then, no one,
And before not towards the people, didn't complain for fear.
yes, why, yes, no? And, for the truth, also, the, thesecurity system was practically, was useless. I mean, one declared a crime, and
mhm.
there was a submission of paperwork that I don't know- did not lead to anything.
Already. Mhm.
E- But, then, finally, there have already been, then, say,a little more,this, this, affirming the action, of, of the police, and things like that. And, trying, to dial, of to-
Mhm,mhm.
catch more thieves, and kidnappers. And much more, as well with this. So, people already feel that there is a little more response to, to all this,
Mhm,mhm.
before these allegations.
Mm,
Before, not so much. But, even so, and also, for example, there was a march in, in Mexico, a couple of years ago,
Mhm.
a year and a half ago, almost. was called the, A Silent March For The Security of Mexico, in which all all theworld took a walk to, to
to the center of the city.
Mhm.
And, there were millionsof people, it was filled.
Wow, mhm, mhm.
Like everybody was dressed in white and on the streets.
Wow, that is impressive
Then,you notice it that yes, like is true, something sociallynecesary. Like people are there already
mhm, mhm
much more attention to security
mhm, mhm, and no.
any other thing
I don't know how it will be in Me-- sorry, I mean, I do not know how it is in Mexico, I think like here is when TV comes in.
It infuriates it is the same, it is scary cause news are very locals and very..
yes
going around and around each robbery and they explain and explain, and
yes, yes, yes, yes
really
yes
yes, yes, yes, yes  its morbid and I don't know what
but yes, yes
and
In Mexico, in Mexico like is not that, cause it is like to much
o.k
it's practically impossible to include every single robbery or every
Mhm, mhm, mhm.
every, rape or every, I don't know.
Mhm.
every robbery that takes place, do you understand? Then, they put up just the ones that are really huge. I mean, when there are kidnappings
Sure.
very drastic, or when they are like the one, the one of the dead women in Juarez that are
Alex, oh, Besy.
It is Javier.
Oh, hello.
Hello. How are you?  Uh this. Un, I think this is good, I have never participated in it, as jury but I would like to someday, I don't know about you.
Not to me, I got a letter last year
oh, yeah?
But this, for me to serve as a jury, but i said I'd better not.
No, uh, you know I sometimes say that, this is a bit difficult because, more than any compromising.
Mhm.
because, maybe after you have, if you cause a problem, this is not, how they have your, I think, they have as your record, or your data in court, is more safe, I do not know
I do not know, as, I say that jury service is something, uh, dangerous because, well, it depends on where you go to serve jury duty
or that this is a, a
yes
a case where someone has killed someone, or, or someone, uh who sells drugs
yes, yes.
What is your name? Of the
a, well, a drug dealer or something
Yes. And, they can have friends, say you say that they are guilty, and they can have those friends persue that person and kill them or their children
Oh, yes, yes, you have reason, no, because you can say they are there and
Oh yes
and I mean can make a description of yours and
mmh.
and it can, can, yes, it could pass that too, but but I don't know, but they say that, that, that, I mean it is optional if you, if they send you a letter
Aha
eh, is it optional that if you want or are you obligated to go? I don't know exactly.
No, this, well the letter they sent me, this, I I said no, but I sent a letter to my doctor
Aha
telling him that I couldn't be sitting for a long time because, because I have an illness that doesn't allow me to be sitting for a long time, or walk for a long time, or stand for a long time
Oh
and then they said that it was fine, that I didn't have to serve in the jury
Of course, it is
Already and that was last year, already
Oh yes, it is, it is like, they sent a letter to my friend like that but since he works, I mean, from six in the morning until four in the afternoon, then no, he said that he
eh, the company's manager said that he was well someone who couldn't, this, couldn't miss, no?
it does, already and I imagine that he, he asked for a letter
Exactly.
to send to the jury, to, already for him
Well yes, yes, yes.  But I don't know, I mean, sometimes I think that it would be good because, in the, more than in the case of the
rapes of boys and girls
Mmh
if you can serve as a juror, and if so, how is it? you realize if the person is guilty
can help to faster justice is done, i think it's good idea to be a jury
now, for that yes but, but well, I would not like at all
Ah
no, I am very shrill, and that's all
today, shrill
no, if something happens, like violation of childrens, i don't know, they will put a video of something, eh
Oh, ok, ok, i will not stand, it's ugly, horrible
oh, no, is very ugly, yes
you what? ah, where they sent you? this, that, what state?
ah, i live in Canada
Oh, you living in canada, oh
yes, aha, and you?
I'm here in new York
Oh, aha
yes, but, what i was telling to you of my friend is in arizona, because i was living there
ok, mhm, oh
so, there in canda, is the same system? you think so
more or less, I think, i don't know
oh, look, mm, oh, good, good, so
I see.  Aha
I don't know, like I said ehm if the day will come, well uh, yes, yes, it was, but, but like you say, one must be careful, no?
I see, one must be careful, I see, it de-, depends but they don't tell you what, what kind of case, until the time when you get there, maybe, to the to the in front of the judge, or, or to the
Oh, that means they, no, uhm
or to where it has to be
to the, but I, I imagine that they must do like a meeting or a seccion to tell you, to explain the case to you
yes but that is when you already, you already said yes, that you are going to do it, already
you are already involved, you decided, ehm
I see, to be a juror
oh, I see, I see, I see, I see,
I see, and if you say or not, I'm, I don't want to do it now, ehm, too late
No too late
He already said yes Already
What, which was your name, right?
Besy, Besy, I see
Petty Oh Sessy or Jessy?
No, Besy, with a -B
Oh, Besy, oh
I see. Aha And yours, Javier?
Javier, yes, yes, yes
That's it, mine is easy
Oh, you are already living in Canada, so then for how long?
Fifteen years already.
Fifteen years?  Wow
I see, I see.
How can you resist the cold?
Uhm, well, ehm, I lived in a city before, where it was super cold in the winter and there was a lot of snow
I see
there was a lot of snow fall
yes
and then, my husband and I we decided to move to, to make of the beach
I see
in ano-, in another province
Oh
and then here, here in the winter is like rain and nothing more
Oh
and it doesn't get so frozen
Oh, I see, and in, in what state, that, provinces or states?
Aha.  It is, it is a province, it is British Columbia it is close to, ehm, where I live it is close to Vancouver I don't know if you have gone to the city, aha
Oh, Vancouver, I see, isn't that around Washington State?
Yes, yes, then more or less, yeah, aha, ya
Yes and, no. Oh, yes, yes. You know i had plans to go, i mean, to Vancouver, because i had some Bolivian friends there
Oh, aha
but i lost contact with them and didn't go, because they tell me the life there is a lot quiet, don't know if it's true
Oh, yeah, is, i person that, talked to, told me that, you know, you must be living i a paradise, and i say, why ?
because you have lots of islands and the sea close and you can go to, to United States
Oh.
with, having a passport
Yeah, yes, yes
you can go alone, cross the border and
Ah
from here, the border is like ten minutes from here
Then yes, ah
yes, from Washington, yeah
Oh, an you're from, where you from originally ?
the, from El Salvador
Oh, yeah, yeas, i imagined that. I'm from Ecuador.
Ah, aha
yes, because i, i listened, some, a little of your accent from Salvador, yes, no, good, and then, i will see some day if i can go, because here i tell you
Yes, yes
Here the justice as, right?, sometimes here also, like, sometimes, ¿right?, sometimes things aren't right
Yes. And, there's
and, and he, and he, ¿come again?
Uh, er, sorry
Yeah, tell me.
No, i, there's this, ¿what's it called?, uh, that, let's say, you kill someone and they give him the death penalty
Right
Uh, there's, ¿are there any state there like that?
¿Like here in the United States?
the death, the death penalty, right
Sure, yeah, i mean yeah, they give you the gas chamber penalty or, you know
Yeah. But i, i was watching something on the, something on the news the other day, about this lady, uh, she killed her three children
Right
she, she put them in water and the children drowned
Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And then my mom told me, "no, they should kill her, drown her", and i told her "it's better to throw her in jail, because she'll suffer more in jail"
while the other inmates know that she did, and because she's
Right
or, i mean, that they'll tear her apart, i think
Sure, they, they'll hurt her and she'll have a bad time, but imagine that, ok, now, a serial killer who has, has killed someone and
and right then, what, to the gas chamber?  No, since they have to punish him, yes or no? for a few years
I see, sure, something that makes him suffer no, because, if they just kill him and
Yeah, right  That yes
suffered, mm, what, ten minutes or whatever, and it was but, but if they put him in jail, oh the other prisoners, mm
Hmm
poor guy
yes, well no
Over there yes, over there people do suffer, I say
Of course, it is, over there they are going to abate
Hmm, over there he is going to, over there he is going to pay for what he did, already
What he did.  I don't know why whey oh, why do people do that, no?
Right
Right, but you know, like I tell you neither
Who knows?  Crazy people
people are crazy
Hmm
and like I tell you here it, it is becoming difficult every time you listen to the comments that, that there were in Canada everything is more calm
I see, here is is somewhat more calm, yes
yes.
because I imagine that the the health care of, of the United States is not, is that good, or, or is like the, the, ehm, what is that called?
What is a card that they give you for health called? I don't know what it's called
Oh I don't know, Medicare or something
Yes, medicare, this
Yes
No, it's not very good
Yes, exactly
O, yes?
And there?
ah, here is, I say, it's good because
More just then,
it's more just, even though it's more just than
How nice
than there
Listen, how is the work opportunity there?
They are looking for a ton of people to work in construction
What type, whichever type? Construction
Of security, I believe that it's to make buildings or something
Ya
Ya, and they ask for other provinces
oh
But if one has, if one has the experience of building buildings or of building houses or something like that
yeah, yeah.
I imagine that they can ask for a visa or, or something, I don't know
Oh, no because
Aha.
because I was listening to something that, that, that, that this country, Canada needs a bunch of people, right?
At least in the, in the province where I am, uh, this, I heard on the news yesterday that they are, they need people for
for, this is to work in construction
Oh, well yeah, there is, there is, there is a program, it's on the internet where if you accumulate points, like seventy four points, and one
it's possible to go to work and the government helps with everything
Where? There?
Yes.
Oh, really? Oh, that I didn't know.
Yes, it exists.
Mm.
Yeah, you can
Mmhmm.
I'm half interested in doing this, huh?
Yeah.
It would be good.
Yeah.
And some day have you had trouble with going to court or that?
Me? No.
yes.
Hello?Hello? G hello?Hello?
Hello? Pardon
Alo, but No, it is good, uh What is your name, where areyou from?
John, eh, from New York.
Ok, my name if Jennifer, from New York.
And you? Oh
Ok, Let's start this thing, To finish fast.
But What is,um topic? Did you hear?
Ok, So uh The theme is uh uh, the, interracial marriage.
Oh OK Because I don't hear very well, me.
Oh, yeah, this is, this is the theme of today So what do youthink of interracial marriage?
It is not important to me. After that, you're in love witha person,
Hm mm
but, you marry whomever you want
And, good I
No im- I don't believe that it is important. It doesn't haveto be important to anyone either.
But me, I also asked what, what do you think of Uh if it is easier for certain races to marry like whites and chinese,
Me no
Uh, negros and hispanics, thinks like that, you wantedto know.
I don't believe that it is easier, but it is more no nobetter, because, like a Latin person with a latin, but now the same thing depending where you live, if you marry- if I am Latino and I get married to, to dark or something,
Hm mm
in many places, maybe many people are going to criticize.
Oy, yes, they cri- they always criticize.  They criticize, if you get married
We are, yes
yes, yes you are- and you marry a Hispanic woman, cla
Yes, but all the races.  What is your race?
I, I am, uh, of Dominican father.
Aha, and your mother?
So And eh, both parents.
Both parents are Dominican.  Well, I am Puerto Rican.
Yes Ah well yes, my, my husband is Puerto Rican.
Yes
So Ah, that was also a problem.
With his
With his family.  Of course, his don't like Dominican people.
Yes
So however, when you look around, that has nothing to do with race, because even my husband says it.  If we were going to detail
things in each family, if it were a family situation,
Yes
My family is even there are more professionals in my family, we are more educated, uh,
yes
lamentably in, in economical things we are more stable, economically. However
Yes, I
the one reason that they had for not liking me, it was that the last girlfriend was years before he met me she was Puerto Rican,
and I was from Dominican parents, born there, grew up, here.
Yes, no, I, I um I have Dominican family.
Uh huh
I have many cousins who are married to Dominican women,
G
and um, he, they have left them.
Uh huh
Divorced and all, and they don't have contact, and still the girls keep on each time that they see them, oh, we are, that is my cousin, or and they have, they have lived with us and all.
Uh huh
And always they have grown like oh, they are my family, we have become, I have many Dominican friends.
Yes, uh, I don't explain why the ignorance of
I have black family too. That my cousins have married dark, uh,
of yes, I have, a, a wife of my brother is eh, um, Afro-American, she, you know
Yes, d- where in New York are you?
what?
Where in New York?
Uh, er, Manhattan.
Oh, I'm in the Bronx.
Oh, ok, so, yeah, so, uh, the subject, to me, uh, i understand it, having been, uh, raised here, in New York, um
Yeah, that's why i think so too, i think
I understand it and it's not a big deal for me, as long as both people are happy
Yeah
Uh, i don't, i care little about them being green, or yellow, or
Yeah, me, me too, i have dated with girl, girls from many different races
Um, um
They're, um, i don't know, i don't, i don't care. My first girl was dominican.
Oh, ok, oh, ok; and, the funny part is that we're not all equal
Yeah
Because there are Dominican persons in my own family, that i don't like.
Yeah, yeah, just like, just like me, i have some friends that are Dominican
i, i don't like them
But they don't say they're dominicans, they don't tell people they're dominica much, because they treat them wrong.
Yeah.
Because they're dumb and that, and he says, i have, and they don't, because their own family say they're dumb
Um
Like, they tell them they're rude, all that stuff, and they're
Yes, hm mm
they are very um nasty
Yes but
They themselves get-bochonno, and I told them that they shouldn't get bochonno because that's present in every race
But eh exactly I like to say to the people, I speak to them in my professional life, I speak with all types of people and I say
I say from where are you, I'm Dominican
Yeah, I know a man, ok.
What? From where? How could that be, I think you are, what does that have to do with anything.
No I know a man, that is a policeman, I am a policeman right?
Hm mm
And I, he always, he has tattoos, uhm of the Puerto Rican banner
Yes
And I believe that he has always been Puerto Rican, up until two or three weeks ago that we had a barbecue for no, two or more than tree weeks ago to say goodbye to summer
Yes
He was speaking there and the wife was speaking there and and he right that and that banner. And I didn't know what that was and he said that the right on the banner was not Dominican and that and that and he made
Eh
sus uhm, like how, when he became a citizen here
Hm mm
and that he always said he was Puerto Rican and that he changed his papers and everything to say that he is Puerto Rican
Pe-but that is
Well he was born here.but he changed everything from the parents and all,all that
His your friend, but that is ignorance because
Yeah,I said, but and why did you do, then he said because that people do not,do not talk to me.not him
tu sabes
Do not want to know anything Dominican, I say ,but I, That is not that way because just now,there are Puerto Ricans that do not want to know anything about the puertoricans,but
yes
for the life they say Oh, i am puertorican.
It is but.no
Never say-never change. I don,t know why you should change it.
Exactly
and him well no.I am I I am american,puerorican american,and with that I do not do
That is don't have.that is. I'm sorry that is ignorance.
Ah I.me being dominican,hey I am dominican,because I can not change it.
Yeah,this eh
Not like him,that he been paying and paying.to change all.for it to come out that he is puertorri-y do,and,and from New York
And still you, you knowing that has nothing to do with that
hm mm
that, that doesn't change anything because still.
yeah where, where, where am i working today,
aha
There are many Dominicans here in The Bronx. There are, there are many Puerto Ricans. But there are also Dominicans.
Uh huh.
A lot of people say, "Oh Dominicans are ignorant, they don't know how to do anything, there are a lot, there are a lot of Dominicans."
There are all kinds of people in all races.
They all say that there are more Dominicans than white people.
Well, if there's one thing about the Dominicans, it's that they love to reproduce.
Yes
To have children
Yeah, well, and then the Puerto Ricans don't say anything. But as they say, the more Hispanics, the more Latinos, the better.
Yeah.
The little white guys are those who have lots of Dominicans, and this and that.
Yeah.
These Puerto Ricans want to grab every little thing here
Well, you know, about that
That's right.
Yeah, it makes me want to speak English, but I can't, we can't
I know, well, I'm getting up too
But all this is why my brother is a policeman here in Manhattan.
Yeah, yeah.
In the 23rd Y there, the YMCA, he and I worked in an inves - Uh, as an investigator, but I mostly work with the police
Yea
So in this
Yes
So, just a second, So, I always tell you this.  Always, oh, "where are you from?"  After this they speak with me a bit, that I helped, they said things, sure, about the Dominicans, in front of me,
They talked, oh yea, yes, bla, bla, bla, bla.  They asked me, oh "Where are you from?"  Dominican.
Yea, I, I also spoke about the Dominicans that way.
oh
but in front of them, and the same about the Puerto Ricans in front of them
Right
Speaking is one thing, talking, but there are some that speak about them, and they shut up there, until there, until they win the point
Oh sure, right.
Because I, I sometimes, we are a group speaking, and I say, look, he's a Dominican, that dirty so and so, but I am speaking in a group, with
Go on, go on
two or three Dominicans, with two or three Puerto Ricans
Sure
with white guys, that how we talk
Yes, because
but
You can, but that's it, the difference is that you can criticize a person and describe him as that Dominican stopped there in that corner.
Sure, because when I see a people in the street that I know, that I see are Dominicans, that have a bandana or something, they are Dominicans
Ok, but yeah
I, ey Dominican, come here
Yeah, exactly, aha
Like that, yeah
They are known because, unfortunately, the, the worst Dominicans, the ones that always make stuff painted, have a tattoo
Yes like the
they have a shirt, they are
Yes the women as well
Yes
What is from far for something
Oh yeah eh, yeah, yeah also that, but not all of us are like that.  It is, that, that is the funny thing, because when I was at college that was, oh, where are you from?
New York, Oh Oh, what, what, how, what what ethnicity are you, Oh, I'm Dominican, Oh no.
Yes Yeah
I don't think so
Yeah Yeah, turn around
Yeah, Oh, no, that one, that one is unfortunately tha's a, a trait we all have but, but still, it's the whole point of
Excuse me the point that um because we are and he have that atribute
Yeah
No, that does not mean that we all are the same
Yeah
It's because I have female cousins that embarrass me because they are sluts, basically
(above sentence is in English)Yea Oh no no, I didn't mean it that way, I meant it with the back part
And, no no. But no no. I understand you know? It let's you go to the heart of it.
Yeah.
They are like this, and also other people
Yeah.
You know, we are professionals, and we do what we do, it's said OK, my grandma had a nice butt, and the whole world hurt her.
Right yeah, but you know, it's always like that, it's like
But
From what? You know what they are, right? Sluts, like you said.
No.
Puerto Ricans.
We all have one.
Dominicans, hell yeah.
Yeah, so it's like, well, it bothers me that something so simple like "you know you're Puerto Rican and I am Dominican"
Like, look at me, my family, with their own cousins and everything.
No no no. I know, but
I know that for a fact
Yea, but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity.
Yeah
Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are what, like nimety miles apart?  We are closer that Florida and Cuba.
yeah
and we hate each other just because of where we were born, what is that?
Yeah it's no even, it's because like some, like the Dominicans say, oh, dominicans think they are better than us, and Puerto Ricans think they're better than us, like that
Exactly, yeah, but I, you know
And that's all starts, like even in chatrooms, in the computers checking out the chatrooms,
Hm mm
and that's just like crazy, the way that we're fighting
it just.  it make me laught. I usually don tell people until I am asked, but I never deny my race.  Like people say something, and I'll stand and be like, oh, hold up
Yea well, the reason why I part asked you why you are from New York, because
Hm mm
like what part of New York, because you sound like like white
Get out of here
Yeah, you sound like white
Oh thank you so much, I speak Spanish like a White person too?
But No nothing, nothing of course, not now let the Spanish come out
Oh L- let me find out, ok, That's another eh, that's another things that bother me. Just because a person is, um, You waht, what does it mean to some White
Yeah, like
You know what I'm saying, what
Like me, when I told you I'm from the Bronx, I thought you were going to hang up, because I had three callers, I told them I'm from the Bronx, ad they hang up
Hm mm
they hang up on me
No, abs-please, I'll tell everybody I don't care
In, in Florida Disney World,
Hm mm
It was a line, ad we were standig a few excuse me, 'cause you had, the line was moving, but they weren't moving,
Aha
and I had, I said Bronx New York, and they Oh, honey, come one, they're from the Bronx, and they moved, and they got off the line like
out embarrassed,
No, it's not, it's not your fault, it's not
I was like, oh, oh well
your fault is not to, is, you know, people act ignorant around me all the time, and say stupid things like that, and it's like
Yeah
Hello?
yes Hello?
Hello, good night
Good night, How you doing?
Good who am I talking to?
David.
Ah,David Is Joe,or Joe-Jose
yes How are you?
Ah,good,good and where do you live?
Here in Connecticut, I think I spoke to you a week ago.
A-Ah,yes,yes,yes How are you?
yes, it dropped, the call dropped No?
yes don't know why.
Eh, don't know why it drop.
Ah.yes I do not know what they will do with that because also
Oh hi, how you doing?
many calls that. that have dropped, and for-yes looks like
yes
there is many people, don't know, there, there many calls that they are not processed, then I beleived they do not know how many valid calls.
have each person,then don't know what v-what they do.because there are many persons that, for example they have reached the twenty five calls.
Ah, yes?
But she knows that there were many calls and it wasn´t that the call got cut. Then, she doesn´t know what to do, right?
oh, but they still call you ,or not?
yes, they still call her. I don´t know, two weeks ago, yesterday they were calling her. But, I think they are still doing it, I don´t know. But,
Ah, they are only paying for 25 Don´t they?
I imagine that it is. I imagine that it is. But, and, ah, yes, is that, at the end, the thing is that, I think is not well organized, it surprises me because
they have done it several times, the LCD, because they did it two years ago, or a year and a half ago.
yes,to do it in English or not?
But, before, yes, it was,eh, it was in English, but there was too in Arabian, and in Spanish, and whatever. But, yes, yes, that is an old story. They have make it many times, then, I don´t know, or at least one time.
Ah
And, that time,of many months. I don´t know now because suddenly is something new, ah.
Ah, yeah, mmmh, I don´t know, in a matter of way
No,
is really clear, because the other time, ah, yes, they have the. the topic, was about religion,
And there were about fifteen or twenty days that was purely the same topic.
Ah, I know. No, no, no. And it is not that only that the, the recorder that was, I imagine, some, some kind of computer, or something that they have there, ah.
Aha.
And, that I said it was my theory, they said  that the text was written in English, about what they wanted to say
what, what, that I hear, right?
Ah.
The, they went to the car- this, translator.  Then, they entered the text there,
Aha.
from English to Spanish, and then, there, from, from that, they copied it to a computer that, that, that did, I don't know, what, e- e- then, that there are computers, or there are programs that one
enters, enteres a text, then the computer, the computer reads it.
Right,
yes, yes.  No, no, then, then, the translator, was something like that, kind, I can imagine
Aha.
Then, what was said,
Ah.
I imagine it was that, that was a computer.
Of course, of course, of course. Mmh.
Then, no, no, no it just had a very bad accent, but it also everything it said, for example, when calls ended, it said,
your time is pointing upwards
Yea, no, I never saw so much, because when
yes, no, no, no, not I.  I didn't either, well, I, I, I didn't even notice until, until several times.  Really? that I heard it, that, that, that I didn't understand anything.  Really?
Yes.
And, then, one time, there, I heard, ah, yes, your time is pointing upwards.  O, for example, one time, what was it?  what did they have, am, the, the subject was dating,
then,
Mm
the, the translation to Spanish was to give the date of a day.  Then that, like that.  How do you like to give the date of a day?  Things like that, that are
Yeah
Uh. Unbelievables. But, and, and, they obviously have some people that speak spanish. True? Uh, I don't know that is, no e-
Yeah but, you kn- depends
it hasn't been well, very, very, very well organized.
No, because they are always tiring of system, because if one will, will, will shoot them an email, they respond well, for back, the next day, very quickly.
Mhm. Mm, Yes. Shudong, yes. But, the good is that they pay well, in the end. One is a bit at at times a bit bothered, that way, to have to answer and,
but, no, no it isn't that much, there. And, they pay well.
Yeah, but, ah, with, with me, I, I, the last time I did it and it ended.
Mhm.
And, and I don't know what happened, they didn't call me back, and they didn't have a phone to call or something like that, but they sent me a check.
Mhm.
You know, its been like tw- sixty days maybe like two months passed, and they sent me a check.
Mm. Mhm.
I even forgot. I, it didn't cross my mind.
Ah, a surprise,
Yeah, that's, that's true and you live in Philadelphia, no?
Yes, in Philedelphia, yes, yes, well, well, my mother lives in the outskirts I live here, eh, in in West Philly, in
Okay
i-in the university. So,
Oh, because you guys live outside to. No?
I am here, I am here close - Mm?
at school? You guys go to Penn State you told me, no?
No, no.  University of Pennsylvania yes, no, no, yes it is different, yes, that, everybody gets confused with that, because there are, eh, well, Penn State
it is in, in the center of, of the state,
Yeah Aha
and it is, eh, it is, it is a public university.
Right
And then, am, it is, then, the university where I am, it is the University of Pennsylvania.
Ah, in two different, then
yes, exactly.  Yes, it is private, and it is in the city, it is completely different.  The other one, it is much larger, it is public, it is in the country.
Yeah, those that are in, and another thing like that, no?
Ah.
Where there are hills, no?
I don't know.  Eh, well, I have never gone there, I, I don't know, exactly, where it is.
Around there. Oh
But, what do I know, what is- that is downtown.  Well, maybe if he, at eighty-first, maybe one, maybe- But, but even though eighty-first, I think it is going to
no. Possibly yes, possibly yes, because I know that eighty-first goes I don't know, better, I better not say anything. I
To me, it is the same
yes, my e- e- e- yes, yes all I know of, of eighty-first is that, because before we used to live in Tennessee,
and North East,
Uh huh. All right
and then, there near Virginia, well they are we lived in Virginia. Then, we went to Tennessee. But, over there I took the eighty-one, that is all that I know.
Ah, okay.
it seems like it's- the highway is long, I don't know. I don't know. But yes, e- but then, you, but, You just, you are studying, or what, or what do you do
Ah, no, I that work. I wish I was working, uh, I wish I was going to school.
Mm. Ah, okay.
But, um,
Much easier, I imagine, .
Yeah one no, no, doesn't think so, but, when one is in school, there is where all the friendships are, they don't have to go out for, for, ah, you know, communicating with their friends.
No, everyone's there right now, in the very center. You know
yes, yes, yes, yes.
But, now when one goes out, and has to be at home, and has to pay the, the, the household expenses, it's very difficult. It's better to stay in school.
yes, it's a good, but, it, it, the good thing about being in school, is that it's one thing that, now when one finishes, now the expenses of one, go up
quite a lot. Right? Then, it's, one now buys a car, and and, and wants this, wants the other. Then, now one has to start to work. Right? For, for supporting oneself, while one, you are a student, one lives there
Yeah, by force. Yeah.
in a little, there one, I don't know. I don't know, if you are familiar with Ramen Noodle Soup,
No, no, no.
no, no, no, those soups of, that they sell for, of Ramen, that cost, yes, twenty-five cents.
Oh, yeah, yeah
yes, one lives on Ramen Noodle Soup, for twenty-five cents, the twenty-five cent dinner, one, then, no, it's so,
Yeah, yeah yeah
un- you spend a lot less, but it is a life that is more, quiet, yes, it is quiet, but, also I I think that, that when people remember when they were students, they forget everything, of all the work that you also go through.  Right? But,
Of course, yeah
yes, yes, but also it is a life where you have more freedom, more flexibility with time, like, for example, if tonight, if I want to spend
every night awake, and then, I don't know, studying, and I don't have classes tomorrow, it doesn't matter.  Right? Because, I don't have, or, or if some day I don't want to go to class, I don't go to class. Right?
Eh, yeah
But, at work, you cannot say, ah, yes, I didn't want to go to work today.
Yeah, well that does not happen.
Just yes, no, no, no it is like that very flexible, like that.
No, no, your abilities
Mm.
in life.  When, already when you are out of school, everybody calms down, you know, they have their family, or they get married, or you know.
You know, they have children around there, or, and, and life becomes more difficult.  No?
A lot harder.
Yeah, because, because of that, if you want to live the, their life, Americans', I am going to say.  you know
The dream of all Americans, you know, that, that they want to buy their house, this, that.
yes. yes. yes, the problem is that I feel that, that when, that, no, that is what you have to, to, to to be happy with all, all that you have, and that seems to me that is what
many people don't, because you, your income rises, and with that, obviously, and the work, responsibilities increase.  Right?
But at the same time,
Right
everything that one consumes, its -one, one goes to buy a better car, and one, maybe, does this, and does that. And so, when one looks, money flew away, right? And, one only stays with, that's what it looks like to me, only with the responsibilities. right?
yeah
Then, I don't know, its like, I don't know, now, Im happy as a student, for now. right? but, eventually, for sure, one has to save and buy a house. But,
I don't know, that scares me a lot, that, of having fixed costs. Right? Because, its like one works, and works, works,
Yeah
and one feels that, that you're not enjoying your money. Right? But, that, in part, is because one says, well, one thinks of all the benefits that one gets. Right? But, also
one has a car to go to work. Right? Then, one has to have this, to, then one has to cut the grass. I don't know, its seems like a lot,
right yeah
too much, like that, fixed costs, is fixed responsibilities, Its, I don't know.
Yeah, you're more, more responsible in life.
yeah, definitely.
But, you know, but, and the, from a poors life, its more, its easier.
yeah, right.
a poors life, has nothing to do with anything, you know. If you want to work, you work, if you don't want to work, they support you.
yeah, yeah, that's how it is.
you know
your wife supports you
yeah, more or less, same thing, you know,
yeah
but, eh, you have to find a, a good woman, that does this, and that, that can help you, that, that has, that has, a, house, or has an appartment, that helps you, this or that. But,
Yes, yes.
no, but that's how life is, well. No? You know
Yes.
Live and learn
Yes, no well, eh, it seems that if, there is, there is, that is why, why one has to, like this, i think, careful with, with
how one wastes money. Because, it is very easy. Because, for example, if if you buy one thing, then, buy another, and another and another, I, one has nothing, and one feels that oneself is not, not going to enjoy money. True?
One has to seriously see
Right
What is most important, right? What, what is what I like
right, no but,
And if not, it is not that. Then, it is better not to spend money on that. Right?
You tell me, the, the large companies, they are- ate they giving you things.
That is what is seems like.
Don't you see the, the large companies, they giveaway the cars, no money down? They give the, the things,
