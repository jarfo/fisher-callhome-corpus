hello, good af- good evening.
Good evening, here I am Norma, from Atlanta.
Ah, well, look at that.  I am, from
Ah, yes, ah, we are- we are nearby.
yes, we are quite close.  Is this the first call you have taken?
yes, because yesterday, what happened is that since I had gone out, they called me, no, the, the computer called me, but I wasn't there, so, I couldn't.
I couldn't answer.
Ah- I, I am without cell phone, they called me three times, but I was at the store, I couldn't, you know, take ten minutes to talk.
Of course.
But, where are you from?
I, Peruvian.  And you? Ah.
Puerto Rico.
Ah, from Puerto Rico, ah, OK.
yes, yes.
Then
Well, yes.  eh, they said that we can talk about meta- marriage, or talk about anything.
yes, talk about what and things, but we have to use the word marriage, I guess.
Ah, OK, then, we already used it.  Right? Are you married?
yes, I am married.
Ah, OK.
It's been 8 years
ah, well, it's very good
And you?
No no
ah, you are not married, ah okay
No, I was married, but now no. Yes
Ah, you are divorced, ah okay.
Well, and have you spent many years here in Atlanta?
Yes, 10 years already
Same as me. I've spent 10 years, I arrived here in 94 in order to go to college
Ah, I can in 95
Ah okay
by means of the temple. So that, after, here, here is where I got married
Well, one could say that, one could say that you are already from Atlanta, then
Yes, More or less
More or less, but you go back to Peru every now and then?
No, since I came, I have not returned
Ah, okay
I have not returned, so
It becomes difficult, no?
Yes
Sometimes it's difficult. You get so involved in your own lives and becomes difficult to return to your homes
there is also the money problem, when it is not enough. That's the problem I think
Yeah, exactly, I know i can get a flight to Puerto Rico, if it is in sale, is not that expensive, you can get one.
At least, 200, round trip
Oh,yes
But if it is not on sale, you'll be paying like 500 or 600 per person
Oh i see, Puerto Rico is near, right?
Yes, it's like a three hour flight
Oh, it is near, I have to go all the way to Peru, Peru is in South America, So
I imagine is really expensive
Oh, it's really expensive
Do you have any family here?
No, I came here with my church. I belong to a religious organization, so they help me getting here
Oh
And I guess we should talk more about marriage, right?
Well, they said we can talk about anything, but you know
Mmm
If you want to talk about marriage, well, we can talk about some marriage
Okay, Which marriage do we talk about?, let's see
i don't know, mine took three years, and it was sincere, it was because i got married, you know young.
oh okay
and not us, well, you know, we had a clue that they weren't
and
comparable one with the other, so then. when we started real life, that,
mhm
lets say, well, we couldn't maintain the relationship.
oh yeah, and had kids of his marriage, right?
no
no he didn't have kids, oh
no
well, at least, there's one, its not so heavy, if one has kids, it is a little bit too problematic.
no, and we couldnt. you know, we got divorced, but stayed friends, even though i haven't heard from him in years, but, we left, you know,
ha
it wasn't bad, we didn't hate each other, nothing like that
mhm
and i always want the best for him, but, simply that we made an error, cause of our age and our maturity.
we did that.
mhm that's right, well thats a lot less bad, I'm going to say, thank you god, my marriage is going well.
yeah, thanks god.
yes, there we are with the blessings, No, and-
Well, that means that you met your husband here. Right?
yes, yes. I met my husband in the temple where I was living. The
In Atlanta.
belongs to my same religion. So, we married there.
Uh, but, is he also from Peru?
No, he is american.
Oh, OK. And do you have children?
yes. I have two, two kids.
oh, that´s nice.
One is seven and the other one is three.
Oh, God bless you.
Oh, that´s good, thanks, you too. There, to see, that you find another husband.
I hope some day yes. But, if not, you know, I´m happy with my life.
let´s see if you go for another marriage.
yes, let´s see, yes, because I, I said after that, I said that next time, I will not marry until I know that,
and it´s not into my heart that it´ll be forever.
Oh.
NO matter what will come, I can handle it and I can make it last.
Mhm.
So the, let's see
yes, then, hopefully i meet a good person, true ?
yes, that is the most important,
Mhm
loving and have faith.
yes. Let's see, what are we talking about ? What other marriage we discuss ?
Don't know. Then, your parents, remain in Peru ?
Ah, yes, i was in Peru, my mother is there. And, no, i don't have a father.
Ah, okay
And my, my brothers, no, my brothers and mother are there. And your family, where is your family ?
Ah. Then, my mom and dad moved here, after i moved.
Ah, okay. Then, they're close.
And, then, my, my brother followed too. And, all, i now have all my family here.
Mm. Yeah, good. Look, that, that's good
yes. My mom lives near the airport. And, mom and dad have, i think they will make thirty-five this year, in December,
Ah, of marriage ?
of marriage, yes
Ah, yeah ?
yes
They married there, for, eternity
yes. They met when, mommy was two years older than daddy, but they met when daddy was teen- four- no, sorry, fourteen years old, and mommy was sixteen.
And, they were boyfriend and girlfriend almost immediately, and since that day until today, they are together.
Ay, how good, look.
So that, that is a positive marriage of which we could speak.
Yes that is good. Eh, yes. yes, it seems that ah, before, no? older people, they didn't have like, ell- mm, their marriages lasted longer. Right?
yes.
Now there are many divorces.
yes. What happened with, well, you know, of course mommy loves daddy a lot, and that has a lot to do with it. But also, what happened with my mother, was that she
Mm.
came from a poor family, a single mother,
Mhm. Uh huh.
and she never had anything that she s- could call that was, you know, her own.
Ah, okay.
And then, when she met my father. And it was the lov- love of her life, and she got married, then, now she had something, her family. It was,
you know, her belongings.
Uh huh.
And, she so much, for that.
Ah. Ay, she, there, was with him, there, enduring everything, good and bad.
yes. Exactly. Exactly.
Ah, yes. yes, that is what happens. yes, well- my mother, my mother when m- when she became a widow, because my father, no, he died, then, she no, she couldn't remarry.
Ah
She never, she never remarried. She's one of those old-fashioned moms. She said, I won't marry again, I already endured one, I won't endure another one.
No, becau- But they say, and maybe it's true, right? for every person, there's only another, another soul
yeah
You know, another person, that's meant to be with them
yes, yeah
And after you have that person in your life, if they, if something happens and that person leaves, well, you know, you don't need to find someone else because you were already satisfied
yes, that's what happens. Every one has their own destiny
yes
their karma, as we call in the Vedic philosophy
Exactly, their karma
yeah. Do you know about karma?
OH, yes
Ah, nice
Oh, yes. It's important to know about that, because many people don't want to be responsible for their actions, and they think they don't
hmm
They won't pay what they do
Mmmm
And, that is not OK
Yes, that is true, no? Each action has a reaction and if you act in a good way, you will receive good things
Exactly
Otherwise, you will get bad things, and that is also a way to understand, right?
Exactly
You know, all the pain They are suffering, everything is karma
I believe in karma too
Mmm...
How does it goes?, For my own spiritual ideas
Ah, OK
But, even if someone believes in karma, only scientifically, like an energy, energy can not be destroyed
Mmmm
Therefore, if you build up a negative energy, that energy has to go somewhere
Mmm..
and it will come back to you, because you created it
Yes, that's true
And, from a spiritual point of view, which I beleive. God created us for making the best of our lives. But we are responsible of our acts
Hello.
Hello.
Good evening.
Good evening, yes my no-, my name is Tami
Oh, my name is Norma from Atlanta, Georgia.

yes, time goes by very quickly, and one doesn't even notice their age and children grow up.
yes, yes the other day he was angry with me because I had not gone out yet and he, a man thought he was my boyfriend.
Ah, yes?
Because people don't believe my age.
Aha
Then and he is angry I am not his girlfriend, her boyfriend, that is my mom.  I see you and children are so small you should be happy that they think that your mom looks younger.
but great great aha, but ultimately, what I have noticed also is that people
yes.
Here is is very fast to, to get a divoce.
Oh, and yes, now yes.
Nobody wants to work the marriage.
yes, marriages, now the ones that really last are very rare
Hmm.
No, now for any thing, and problems, and right then they just separate like that.
Hmm.
many times no
No, there is patience
they don't try don't don't tr-, don't try to improve things in their marriage.
Your hus-, is your husband Latino?
No, he is American.
Mine too.
Oh, yes, mine is black, American.
yes, that one you gave me What?
Mine is black, American
Mine is White, I am the black one
Oh, no I here the one that has lighter skin
Oh
No, my husband is a Black person, but he is very nice.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, my husband alway-, tells me, he says thank God, because I'm from Panama, and he says thank God that i was sent to Panama and i met you
Because American women, he says to me
Oh, no, it's that American women are now wel-, very independent, they want to do, ¿right?
i don't like them, he, he says not much about the independent, it that they don't respect marriage.
Oh
He, that's what he says to me, no, he doesn't say that it's because i am, i am very independent but
Right
I always take care of him.
Oh, of course, it's just that all of a sudden, no, they don't, right
You know, i don't give him
They don't value a lot like before, ¿right? now is different, all the mindset has changed for the ma-, for the marriage.
No. Uh um. yes, it's, it's so different, because my husband works with some guys
Oh
and they, my husband's work peers are american, ¿right?
Right.
And the, the women give them like twenty dollars every two weeks for lunches, they keep the rest, those are americans. Then he can, it's very funny, it's just that my husband has an ~Xbox, so they get to play it here at home, ¿right?
Right.
And i laugh, because my husband gets called, it's like they're teenagers, ¿can he play today?, and he says mi wife won't let me, and i laugh, and i say to him stop it
¿and you?, your wife lets you do whatever you want, the others, they have to, i laugh, i say hey
working all day, at least one hour to relax, ¿right?
Ah, yes? how outrageous, isn't it?
Like that, and like that I do laugh because when as well it's that they go to lunches to the, to the work of my husband. I tell him, when you want to go, go, I don't care
he tells me ow that we couldn't go because the other wasn't allowed to, I say who didn't let him, and says the wife, he him, he called her.
Ah, yes? The husband is, the wife is who ma-, manages e-
uh huh, totally.
ah, yes?
I say no way we
It's that suddenly like one as a Latin woman is used to sometimes, it's that is a, a society more, more patriarcha-, patriarchal than anything
Mhm.
then one will always be because of the, because of the way one grows up, isn't it? that suddenly one is like that more flexible
yes, that what I, I imagine is a little more flexible and they like that, and after one, they are at peace, they are at peace with you
Uh huh.
but with these women, I say that, this one will go away
Heh.
because they have him like that so tight that that man will look for another place
Sure, suddenly that's why they separate as well, no, there are too many divorces.
Mhm, but not e-
Marriages don't last, one of the
they don't understand
of the factors
Mhm. I tell you no my husb-, my, my children always laugh because barely is that my husband and I, we don't don't shout at home, and that if anything that I'm calling him, and, eh
I have a loud voice, since I'm on the second floor of the house
Aha
My son says don't fight, I tell him that I'm not fighting, I'm shouting
It's that as a good Latin, one many times, eh, have, are used to, no? raise your voice
Aha, exactly. And my son, I always tell him, and they tell me to stop shouting, friend do you want me to tell you when I am shouting? I can show you I th-
Ah, so that
Ah.
it's, it's that, many differences
Ah, yes, societies are different, one even if it doesn't seem so, no? even if at the beginning it doesn't look like it, but there are really many differences, differences in culture, no?
yes, it's, it's so funny because my husband knows, ho-, since I met him, um, he like didn't know how to dress very well.
Aha.
So I always, I always choose his clothes
Ah, you
in the morning, I say I eh, it doesn't bother me, I choose it and since they give him a hard time, at work, I say well
he is the only one that looks good at work, why do they give him a hard time?
Aha.
I say of all of those that have holes in their pants and the women that you don't see and for nowhere and I tell my husband I don't give him a hard time and he dresses well, what's their problem with him?
and he laughs, it doesn't matter to me, that, that he says I'm happy with my woman, he says I say well, so, no, eh
Sure, yeah, I also had a, or I have a friend that married an American and he says that Latin women are so different
Mhm.
yes, really, he a-, he appreciates enough, he says
And yes, it's that
No, because he, the Latina women are very different no, no, they don't make, they don't make many problems
No, and we when we love, we love hard
ah, yes, one is more faithful, I suppose
Uh huh, that is true.
it shows, no? That one is more faithful, really.
yes, but here
More, more, much more loyalty.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Here no, here it's not important to him I have a, the friend of a best friend of my husband got married and in five years they were divorced and it was that prostitute and that
other women and that I don't know what, and I say oh my God and we stuck in the middle because I was a friend of his wife and my husband was best friends with him
Uh huh.
Oh God, I said to him, do not stick me in the middle oh I that, and, oh I say that yes is bad Don't ask me what she said because I'm not going to tell you.
But so rapi-
Of course, yes it's very awful, no? that now the marriages don't last long and really if they have children, the children are those that suffer.
yes. yes, I have one here, my neighbor here to the side
yes.
ah, she married a man and he had a son who was already eight, ah eight years old
aha.
and they had two and this woman, she was, the boy in the face
ah, yes?
don't touch my children you are not my child and I don't know what, and I here I say ay, I would like to grab that kid and bring him here to my house
Ay, poor kids.
because like I saw some times I tell her, the other day I told her you know that I am in my house I don't want to hear your conversation about what, that you are calling your ex-husband dirty and I don't know because you are talking so laud
and your kids I say, poor kids who are hearing all that, those bad things that you say about their dad
mm. Of course
and she says don't
yes, the kids suffer, eh, a lot, they get traumatized when they are very little and have all those problems, no? at home
Mmh.
they get quite traumatized
And she got the husband out of the house and she got another boyfriend there
Mmh.
I say oh my God, you didn't even give time to, to the man who had left there and you already had another
Of course.
And that one too, how he yells at the children, how he yells at the children
Ah, yes, it is really a pity, no? there are so many
I say
lot of time the Government removes the children to such people when they do not get along
Mm, if this woman
no, they do psychological abuse or
don't work
or physical, physically
yes, that's true, this women doesn't work, the father bought here the house and gives her money monthly
Mhm
but listen, i though that, if they give you money every month you can do something, help others or whatever, don't stay there in the house and i think that's the reason for her being frustrated
Ah, yes, then
because she doesn't do nothing and with all those kids that badly strive, i say thank God i don't have to scold them because they are, near me, with that stone strip and don't know what
Ah, yeah ? the fight hard ?
ah ah, and i, with my husband, i wasn't talking with
Aha
i, he came, to shout at me here at my house and i sent hum at my husband, and he watched me like, he said i never saw you like that, and i say right the Latins your better not annoy them when
they don't, he reaches at the last one and you hear him well, and he starts to laugh. Says i never saw you like that, i say right because he had me fed up

Sure, of course, it is something, it's a It's an active episode, no.
uh huh, yes
You want them, if you want for example to teach them something to teach them a lesson like that with humor, then it's very important that the kids
Exactly. uh huh

Sure, Music is part of the culture, and each culture have his own music

al that, we are also teaching my children.
Tre you are who you are Hare Krishna right.
yes, aha
yes, yes, yes I knew, I knew, OK
yes that, and music is very important, especially in churches.
ha
No, music always gives you a good message.
ha
not for people, its so that people can remember. no i see it differently, even when i watch tv.
yeah,yeah,yeah hah
Christians also have their own kind off music, they sing, they get emotionally involved.
hah yeah
and everythings with music, music actually influences if peoples life's a lot.
Yeah and people are not using music for mathematics.
Um hu
I mean something like, two plus two is four, four plus four is eight, a lot of math.
yeah um hu
To learn how to spell as well, Theres a song that shows you how to write a word, it teaches you how to sing the word so you  can remember how to spell it.
um hu
there's a lot of thing out there, with music, everything is music, because many kids learn while talking. My kid would learn a lot with music.
He learned about the time tables with music, i taught him that way, you know.
Um, yeah, because now, for example when kids learn their ABC'S.
ha
you know that famous ABCD song
yeah that's exactly it.
just my little one that is three years old is also there with his with his games, he is there that has a game about a train that we bought him because his birthday was a few days ago
aha aha aha
so it is there, over there with songs, the alphabet, so then he records it there and the song is being recorded there
for you know that I, I made for my oldest son, for my oldest son I would record songs for him that I would read to him in English
my brother recorded them to him in Spanish
um hu
so one day he would hear them in Spanish, next day in English
like that, that is good aha
in a biccle, yes, yes and he had the book, so then we bought him the book in Spanish would fullow the story in Spanish, he was very, very was very, my brother says put it in Spanish too, not just English
because I him, I read him many stories sometimes I was tired, so I put it on a tape and he played by himself and would hear the story
he did not have to I to read the same story sixty and thousand times.
un hu
because when they are little like that one has to read a lot
like that, yes because children when they are little are like a little sponge, they learn everything
exactly, exactly
No, everything that stay engraved on their minds, there is no yes it is the best time to teach them
exactly, yes
Better the better things, good habit
yes, yes it is true, it is true, yes anyway how many minutes do we have, I am already tired, listen I worked so hard, oh my God

and at work also, I keep singing, let me tell you.
Sure, um uh
the day seems to pass faster when I sing. I don't let people who are arguing or fighting bother me
I'm always singing, yes, they call me the singing clerk because I'm always singing

Sure, they learn from there, kids talk that way, they hear abou violence and all that stuff
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Heavy stuff for kids
yes
Precisely for that now, there are, not many, many boys and they get into so much trouble, the teenagers start to use weapons and all those consequences of the influence they have.
All the.
aha
From all the music, from all that, all that they see on television and all the violent things
yes, it's true, the games, those games.
um hu, oh, those games too, those games.
that are so violent, oh my God.
yes
you know the moms and the dads buy them to take the boys from their sight.
um hu
but they are terrible because some of them are there all day long. I have a nephew that gets into his room all day long to listen to music and play those games, you can't see him.
You can't see him and he's fourteen years old
Oh my God. Of course and the kids on top of that, also that's why many times the influences, no, the lack of activity, the kids, there is a lot of child obesity.

No, they are are inactive, they are in front of the computer using their games or with the television.

No, that's why. There's people, they are, there are no kids.
Yes, aha, I feel sorry for the kids that are growing up now.
yes the kids always now are more like inactive.

the music is cheerful but not the lyrics

Hello?
Hello, good evening, this is Mildre from Connecticut.
I think that I already spoke with you.  ehm this is Annie from Miami.
Oh, yes, aha, yes we have talked
But
How are you?  Everything fine?
yes, fine, and you?
Fine, thank you, very well
Ehm.  I don't recall what was the topic that we gave us the last time
I think that we talked about marriage.
That was it, that was it, that you have
Aha.
five children, wasn't, it?
Aha, aha, aha.
yes.
I see.
And is-
Today is the music.
yes
What country are you from?
So, right, i was born in Puerto Rico but we moved in the US when i had 5 or 6 years but my father are Dominicans
Oh
so i do, i feel like i am
Dominican
no, no, i feel Dominican and not even a bit Puerto Rican because i spent every summer in Santo Domingo with my family, and i, like, ay, i forgot, my godmother
Aha
that took care of me, was Puertorican, so then, you know, i have something from both
Yeah right, but you don't speak too Dominican, more like
No, But , you know, depends of the, depends of my mod
Mhm
And you ?
I, so, eh, no, I'm not Puerto Rican and salsa music
Mhm
I like dancing
Mhm
i find that the music helps us know more countries, at least Puerto Rico has big, eh, composers writers and we have artists like
Jennifer López, Marc Anthony
Mhm
Gilberto Santa Rosa that are known in lots of countries
yes
Oh, i think the music, i like it a lot, i put it when I'm at home, dance while cleaning and do it faster, it pleases me, it removes my depressions
whenever i feel sad
Mhm, Mhm
or when i feel nostalgic for my country
yes
then i listen the songs that that were sung, and my mother too
Mhm
And you, do you like music ?
I like it, i always listen to christian music
Oh
eh but also eh, you know, as I have a little girl i try to, teach her or going to show different types of music, so i always have it, what she listens
eh, classical music or Latin music for children
Mhm
eh, or, or English eh, you know, the music you put when you teach the colors or the alphabet things like that. And right now, at this stage of my life, i am more
as you know with music for children
Aha
let's say the music i like more,
So then, how old is the child ?
she goes, has twenty months
Oh, okay, then so-, that is the musical stage
yes, and
They say that children that, that are raised with music, are, since the womb, get very relaxed and learn, they are like even more intelligent
I don't know if that might be true, but
I don't know, tonight we went shoppin and she was in the car uhm, singing the, that song about the alphabet
Aha
you know, and my husband looks at me and tells me, but not her you know, a little young for that, I told her, I don't know, but she is singing it
yes, no, while the boys, sh-, the girls, the best of times
you know
I think that children
yes
four or five years more less
yes
Well, then they forget a lot of things
Well, to me, all
yes
I always forgot a lot of things as well, so that but that, uhm you know, music for us is something very very very uhm uhm
You kno, important, we do not watch much television
Oh
so that all that she, let's say, learns from animals, whatever it is, are because of music and, and the books we read
Oh, _, like that, like that is good, uhm, retarded children learn a lot through music
Yes.
my son's partner had a baby with down's syndrome.
Ok.
He used to play him music and he would learn everything very fast.
Mhm, mhm.
He Learn very fast.
Yes.
And he learned the songs by memory.
I can´t remember what she sings but we have a cd.
My aunt, the aunt Monica, or something like that.
Ok.
She likes to dance and when people sees her they say Oh my god!
OK
It's been about three weeks since the last time she heard that song. SHe used to start the day listening to that song, but she still remembers the song.
You know, I like it because she moves her feet, her knees, the head, you know she enjoys it.
Ok, Ok.
We can also do the movements and she would learn the parts, ok.
yes, she exercises, mhm.
She learns the parts of the body, so now you know it.
Yes, the help is good for her to get to know her body parts and at the same time relaxes her with the music.
And the language also. Because what we are doing is she is you know, I, when my husband is not at home, I speak with her only  Spanish
Then when he arrives eh, completely, well, sometimes ninety percent english, you know, I speak spanish, because I am used, but
Right. Right.
In that way she can get both languages and that is the other reason because we have a lot of music with her, for her to listen it in English and Spanish.
I like it, I go a lot to the concerts when there are salsa concerts, when there are concerts of
Right.
of merengue, I don't, of merengue, I don't go too much. So, What I like most, I like the typical music a lot, the music of, of
How is call? like we could say of our field inside
The full and things like that.
the full, the bomb, all that and after when in
Mhm.
New York make presentations of, of of bomb and full, so we go there.
Mhm.
And we go to the the Olga Tañon's concerts
Mhm.
that, she has a lot of nice music and this guy that plays salsa, this eh, my God, what is, Victor Manuel
Mhm.
I don't miss their concerts, We always go
Since
there are many concerts here and we always go.
Mhm. And us for me, I prefer the, the merengue
Aha.
instead of salsa
yes, because yes, if in your family is more
but
Dominican, well I imagine that you dance more Dominican music
Eh, well, it´s the same because my parents lived in in Puerto Rico, I think that it was about twenty something years before coming to the United States, so
Oh, really?
You know, no, it's not that I don't think we're not a typical family
Aha.
because they liven in Santo Domingo, then the revolution that they had to
Aha, they left.
they went to Puerto Rico, and from Puerto Rico they came to Miami.
Oh, and now they stayed there.
So yes, so you know, they spent a long time in Puerto Rico and much, because that's what I say, that I don't know what country I'm from, because I'm like
a mix of, of, you know, of both.
Like a boy from, from my girl's class, they asked him which country he was from and he said I'm a mix salad and they told me why, because my dad is
my dad is from this country, my mom from another, my grandparents from, he had a mix of race there, that he says I don't even know what I am.
Yes, th- that's how I feel many times because many times I don't feel, not, not comfortable, but you know, I don't feel very Puerto Rican
and I don't feel very Dominican, it depends
Aha, aha.
like so but, you know, I, I enjoy both cultures, and it's not that it's soo different, but you know, they have have some eh
words that, that
I have shown all the traditional music of my country to my daughters.
Mhm.
I've shown her the dances, shown her the music but no, no they haven't listened to it much but the know how to dance it
yes.
and then, I was part of the group of the Puerto Rican stop.
Mhm.
and we made dancing presentations, I was in charge of teaching the girls to dance to dance bomba, to dance full.
Mhm. That is pretty.
to dance salsa
Mhm.
so my girls know how to dance because they both like a lot of music.
I
All love the music.
And also, what what to me, the salsa you know is good or whatever, but I think that allt he music, I like the traditional music.
yes the traditional music is pretty, much prettier.
You know yes, and how not, yes, no, I don't know I like it more and I like to watch her dance more than when people dance the salsa or whatever
I also like the Peruvian music I find it beautiful.
Mhm
the music of the Chinese, Indian, I love their music, nice but do not understand what it says
but the sound they have, you know, it relaxes you
Yes
when I went to Puerto Rico i bought record of those that brings you water sounds
uh
of, trees, of
Mmm. oh how nice
when you want to relax, when you're very tense, so, put that music, and it sounds good, precious
Mhm
Sounds very nice
Yes, that's good. also. we often do, when, you know like right now, before, of of this call, we had came from making the shopping
in five minutes what we do is turn on the radio, and we put like you know, a song that music is average
uh
only, only instrumental, doesn't have any lyrics
Yes, oh, without any message or nothing
and that uh, and that also, it helps me, you know, to relax or  whatever
and that one comes with the one to keep, and make purchases, and go shopping
yes
that's why I say that music is very important for, well, at least for me
Mhm.
because I grew up with all my family with music always
Mhm.
My children my daughter is-, is seventeen years old, so she is  with the liking for the reggaeton and the hip hop and all that kind of music.
Oh yes.
My daughters are older now and they hear more American music
yes
And
yes
I, for exam-, rock and rock I listen to, and I share it with the boys, but it's like I can't listen to it for a long time
yes
it makes me nervous, like really agitated
yes
I don't like rock and roll a lot, I listen to it and I have some young friends who have a, a band
Hmm
and sometimes they ask me to go see them, and I go and spend a while with them, but then I say, ouch, no, let's go, let's go because my head is kind of throbbing
with the, those sounds in my ears
I don't mind the music so much, what bothers me is the lyrics, what they say
Oh, yes, that reggaeton thing now
yes, that, I like that kind of music, but not what they say, and that's why
I think that, that, older music is very different than today's, composers used to, uh, to deal with more romantic things, things that
Hmm
made sense, things had a, moral values that, uh, that gave you a message
yes
Hello?
Hi, uhm, what's your name?
My name's Mercedes, and you?
Pilar
Ah, nice to meet you
Same here. Where are you calling from?
Hmm, I live in but I'm from Honduras. Originally.
Where do you, where do you say you live?
In
In, oh, I don't know that place
It's west of the city of Philadelphia
Ah, huh
past the next town is
Hmm
And you?
I'm from Spain and I live, I live in New York
Ah, I thought they only had, they only had people from the Philadelphia area
No, no, it's, apparently it's people from all Euro- from all the USA, I've talked with people from, well, we had to talk about the cell phones, no
ah, yes, yes, yes
What do you think of cell phones? do you have one?
i have a cell phone but the truth , it is like i don't have it, because i almost don't use it to call
yes, it's very rare when i use it, and you?
I don't have one right now. When i was in Europe i had a phone
Hm mm
but here i don't have one because is very expensive
yes
And i have little money because I'm student
Hm mm
And i decide to don't have a cell phone, but that is not the only reason, i never liked the cell phones. I'm not sure they are healthy
yes, why, why
Because the radiation they emit. is there any research?
Hm mm
proving they really are not harmful
Hm mm
and i don't want to use a phone my whole life and after twenty years they find out that is bad for my health
Hm, yes
and everyone has brain cancer or something like that
Like almost everything, you start using technology, let's say now with the teflon they are doing the same
Sure, and you don't know until after it was good or not
yes
I see, that is a pity, but
And but, let's say, and you have to drive, what do you think about the presien for example about the the ones that drive and are on the cell phone at the same time.
yes, that on top of, it is also more dangerous
And that is really terrible, I do agree when it comes to that
That is very dangerous, there are many accidents now less already, because people us that, headpiece, or, or free hands, I don't know how it is called,
Hm mm, hm m
but a lot of people continue to not use it.  And when you don't have one hand, I don't know how they can drive well
For someo- I think that for me, it doesn't bother mm ehm it is the people that don't have any respect on how they use their cell phones
Hm
That is true, that is that they don't have any type of etiquette in the way in which they use their
yes, because sometimes it is true at times, in the, in the
their cell phone
on the bus, on the, people talk on their cell phones, very loud.
Hm mm, hm mm
And that is a lack of respect, no
Exactly
Because it is not necessary to talk that loud either, one can talk lower right
And And, but more, I think that for me, above all, is the people that do not respect where are they calling, the phone, and the people that drive, but
well that is the con- the convenience, since, that is right there, the phone the cell- cell phone is a technology well that does make communication easier in a lot of, of
of situations, for example, right now with the hurricane, it was the only way in which many people could communicate with their families.
yes, yes, well, but, I think they used the satellite phones. The cellular ones didn't work too well, because sometimes they would work, and yes.
yes, that's true, because we have a friend that was in New Orleans, and we tried calling him on the cellular, and yes, I know, it was like it had been disconnected
the network
yes, sometimes, it would work, and other times it didn't.
and it didn't work. Hm MM
But well, it is, it is true that the advantages that I see, are that you can always be found.
Hm mm
if your battery doesn't die, if they need you for anything or need to speak to you,
Hm mm
they can always locate you, and that's very good.
Hm mm, hm, mm.
And, and then, also, in case of an emergency,
Hm mm
you can call, if your car gets stranded in the highway, or I don't know, if anything happens to you, you can call and ask
and ask for help, and that's very good. That's why when I have more money and can afford to pay it, I'm going to get a cellular phone. But what I'll do is use it with those earphones
But also they have the ones with cards. Right, they have some that have cards, that you buy the card and only use what's on the card.
Do they have those here in, in the United States also?
Mm, I, I understand they sell them in Walmart.
Ah, well I'll find out about that because, eh,
yes, yes, yes because, they say that there's no, because, one problem is that you have to sign a contract right, and the contract is never less than one or two years.
Sure
And I understand that with this one there is not need to sign a contract, and one has a card and one buys then what ones is going to use then
Sure, because too, in the other one, in the contract, you have to pay every month
Hm mm
And also almost always they are plans in which the calls are already included, making them more expensive
yes
In E- in Europe I had a plan, where you paid for a basic service, and, and the calls you would have to pay them separately, but if you made few calls,
then it was much more cheaper.
Sure, ehm yes, and let's say that that is the problem that I you-, we have right now.  The plan that I have, like I say, almost, I have the cell phone, but I barely use it
Sure
And, in cons- at least we have one of the ones that, the minutes accumulate.  But and they get accumulated so much, that we will never use all of them.
Hm
There is no possibility then of of for us to use them.
Sure,
But well, that is that, since, they keep accumulating.  And, and let's say, in Europe the way the cell phone culture is.  It is similar to the cu- the one here, in the United States, or
Hmm, I think that it got to Europe first
Hm mm
the cell phone, and that- there are countries, I, I have lived in Austria, and over there, it was, the, the eighty, more than eighty percent of the people would have a cell phone
That is the the few that didn't have a cell were the younger children, or the, or the older people to whom it reaches already too late, and don't want to use it.
Hm mm
Everybody had a cell phone. And, and but well, it's just that I'm here in the United States since some time, then I left and came back and when I was there, that was three or four years ago.
No, no one used cell phones. People didn't have cell phones.
Hmm...
And in Europe everybody had cell phones. Now I've come back, and here everybody has cell phones, or in other words--in other words they have arrived here too, and I think it's more or less the same already.
And, but--I mean, that they are the same problems that are here, people that have no respect about where they use their cell phone, or--
Yes, yes, the people that more than anything speak loudly, in the subway, in the bus, and, well, I mean, that's not impolite, but there are people who walk on the street talking
with the headset, instead of putting the phone to the ear, they carry the phone in the pocket, and the tiny headset can't bee seen, and they go around talking, and then it looks like they are speaking to themselves and...
That has happened to me, I'm all like, "is he talking to me, or to whom?"
Yes, and you are left thinking that he is crazy, and what could be be wrong with him.
Hmm...
But, already, I've gotten used to it. Now, if I see someone talking to himself in the street, I already think he has a cell phone. But, well, another difference is that there in Europe, people use text messaging a lot, which I think here no one uses.
There are short text messages.
Hm hm mm...
That are written with the cell phone and it's very cheap; it's just, perhaps, twenty-five cents to send a message--Well, it is cheap in Europe.
Here, calls are obviously cheaper, but I don't know... But, eh, here a call costs, um... about twenty-five cents per minute.
Hm mm...
And, eh, the minimum is one minute, and, and on the other hand text messages, well, they cost you twenty-five cents each message. And, when you call you always have to talk for more than a minute almost always.
I think, I do really agree that I think it is not so common here.
Then--
Eh, in my country, let's say it is a little more common, but I think that it is the same about the personal finances of the people, right? Because, how we say it, I, well--
sure
in my country there is not so many money like here true. Here twenty-five pennies are nothing for the people
that doesn't matter, sure
exactly
But there, well there it was very popular specially between students
mmm
because they are fastest that have to write, because write with a phone is complicated, because you only have nine keyboards, and every letter that are there
mmm i couldnt
but the students turn it in kind of a game of skill, even there are contest of who could write more faster
and they safe a lot money sending messages one time to time than calling, even they had tactics a kind of language
hmmm
and sure if you call, and hang up without hook
hmmm
it stays to write who has been called
OK
then these young people use that for call, so you can say they give signals when they call you, missed call
OK
when you do a missed called, you call. you get down that I'm waiting for you downstairs, or sometimes to demostrate that they remember you, then
they call and hang and now i remember you. Instead of send an email or simply that's a message of
hmm
I remember you, I mean that people in Europe have a lot of imagination to save money, yes
Imagination. Many yes, ah.
a lot of cre- a lot of creativity
A lot of creativity, that's the word, yes. No, I, well as I say, I would have to practice a lot to become a bit but no, and, as I say, as I almost never use it
Aha, but
the truth, the only one and the, the truth is that I do u- I have it, but above all for emergencies, and if
one day I had a flat tire, in the car
Sure, yes
above all I, the truth is, uh huh
But it's really good
No
Eh, but if you use it more, like combinations that you use it with the head- with the with the earphone, earplug whatever it's called.
yes yes yes
The earphone, but that v- that's far, so not radiation.
yes, yes
just in case
I should buy one of those, because it's really dangerous. And well, I only talk with my husband in my family, and always
And what?
where he is driving, if he is driving he hangs up the phone.I don't want him to be driving and talking
Of course
Almost never, really, a really few times
Have you heard about next gen phones, which are arriving now?
Are those the ones with credit cards and information inside them?
Ah, no, i was
No
well, i guess also that, but I was referring about the ones where you could watch TV also
What?
You can watch via Internet, you can check your email, it has everything you might need. It's like a mini computer, with internet connection, someday it will come, it has been prepared long time ago, but it never arrives
Yes, yes
There are ones in Europe, in Austria, went out to market last year
Ah
I never saw it, or used, because it was more expensive, but, that would be good
Someone who traveled to Norway told me that they could do basically everything with a cell phone. Buying food from a vending machine
Hmm
paying the parking meter, because it had all you credit card information
Oh, I see, it communicated with the machine
Hello
Hello, my name is Auria
What's, what's your name?
Auria
Auria, hi I'm Nicole
Nicole, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, how are you?
good,, good and you?
good, where are you?
I am a little to the north of Atlanta
I see, and how is it there, how is the weather.
a, hot, but really beautiful, where where are you from?
eh, I'm from New York.
oh from New York.
yes, and I'm in the city now.
has it started to be cold or not yet
no, no cold I don't know, it is warm, right now it has been super humid, but today is the first day that hasn't had that much humid.
and about how long does the fall start and the cold goes.
eh, in October starts the otolo, that is it feels like fall more her, but the cold
okay
the cold really starts in December, January well the snow starts in January and the cold stays until April so
Ah, okay
there's still a little bit left
more or less is like hat but exce- with the exception that here it almost never snows but the cold comes in January and it stays until the middle of March
um
so spring starts but it doesn't last, it lasts about three four weeks and then the heat
ofcourse, ofcourse, same here, spring is super short sometimes you notice the spring
exactly
cold and then the heat
yes of course
listen, and where are you?
I'm from Puerto Rico
of Puerto Rico
yes and you?
I was born in New York, but my family is Cuban and I don't know, also I lived in Chile for a time and so my Spanish is a mixture of things
ah, okay but I was born here, I was born in North Carolina, I was raised there I moved to Puerto Rico at twelve years.
mm
and that was where I learned Spanish
yeah
I say, about speaking spanish, because I understood-understood because my parents spoke Spanish but I always answered in English.
Of course, Me the same, me my, my fathers always speak English to me, but my grandparents, I was raise with my grandparents also, because we lived together and my grandparents.
They always spoke in Spanish to me and I always answered in English and on, I mean, I started to really speak on about fourteen years.
so I, exactly more or less at the age of fourteen, also because at twelve years old, I moved over there, but I almost had thirteen years old.
I refused myself, Not me, not me wanted to know spanish, I did not know nothing about Puerto rico, I was very rebel that they took me away from there.
You know, from my school, about my friends.
of course, of course, at that age how we felt.
Of course, you know, after a year of no having friends, because nobody spoke spanish, so I change my mind.
And, Where do you lived before living Puerto Rico?
north Carolina.
Where? In North Carolina. yes, yes
yeah
hm well, and the conversation, the conversation that I listen, was from cellular phones, I don't know if, over there, because sometimes two conversations are from two different conversations, I had conversations where the person listen to other thing.
right.
But, I don't know what your opinion about the cellular phones without interuption.
Well, only depends of the persons courtesy that use it.
uhm
It is my opinion, I don't believe that should be laws to tell you how you are suppose to use or not.
hm
just simple, I believe that one person should have the courtesy to know that it is at the theatre, should not use it, If it is at the restaurant, it should not be used.
yes, of course.
or at least excuse yourself and get out of the place
sure, sure, that's obvious, problem is there are some people who don't have that level of courtesy
exactly
I've been in movies where the phone rings, in the restaurant, where people have some - I mean, there are two people in a restaurant and one of them is on the phone
I mean, yes, if it's something urgent, obviously, but I don't understand what kind of urgency
yes
it can't be that, that urgent
but even if it was urgent, you say that with permission
sure
I'll get back in five minutes, you go out, outside, answer the call, and
sure
and that's it, but as you say, people don't have that level of courtesy
hmm, yes
the only law I think should exist is one about driving
hmm
because I've seen right in front of me a number of accidents that happen because the person is on the phone
hmm
they're on the highway, and because they're on the phone, they miss their stop, their exit
hmm
and then they do like a u-turn to get to their exit, and I've seen accidents happen because of that
um yes yes yes, I agree, absolutely, I mean drivint
at least have the earbud or earpiece as they say
of course, but having hands free, because you really need to have free hands when you are driving, I see people
If you are going to be in the car
walking on the street, not paying attention because you are talking on the phone, imagine driving.  It is much worse, that you should have hands free, at least.
to drive and the other thing is in the hospitals, that really you should not use phones in hospitals because the signals may interfere with the machines in the hospital
yes
that you should have the phone turned off in other places it is, I mean it is a matter of being aware of other people
exactly
and, and also to be to be polite with people you are with, because when you are with friends or with families answering the phone in the middle of a conversation it should be something important, it shouldn't be
that you are with a friend, talking on the phone with another friend, you see?
or, because that is disrespect the moment you are with that person
of course of course, and the, the phone is something that is supposed to improve communication
exactly
but I believe that worsens communication if you are interrupted always by calls
I, I am- I agree with you, because I believe that a lot of the technology though advance, communication as you say at the same time, we as a society have the habit
of getting out of the moment
of course, of course
you know, with television, with videos, and what do I know with music
with computers
Well, one doesn't live in this same moment and the telephone is often distracting at the moment as well, and I sometimes refuse to answer the telephone.
If I am playing with my little baby girl, she's four years old, she's only going to be four for one year more
um
you know, and you'll never be able to return to this time.
Sure.
while the person who is calling, well I can talk to him, you know
but, I don't answer, it's like I'm with somebody, except for when it's something important, or if it's going to be a short call to agree on something else, but if I am with somebody, I really don't answer the phone
well, I live by myself so I have time when I'm alone, to talk on the phone, alone
exactly
and I, I believe that when I am other people, you should be with that person, what I mean is like it's not like before when there weren't any cell phones, you only spoke over the phone at home and not in the street
exactly
well I don't know, it's a little, it's like a mania that people have to always be accessible and ready
exactly and when you don't
also by email, those people have those blackberries and they are always reachable by email to answer emails and I don't understand what could be so urgent about an email
that they wouldn't be able to answer it until you're back at home in front of a computer
yeah it's true, but it's the people, like you say, it's like a madness or something, they always have to answer the phone when it rings
um
and it's a thing, when they don't talk for even a minute, but they have to answer the phone the moment it rings
um yeah
but I don't, I answer when I'm at the right moment that I know I am able to dedicate time to talk to the person, but yes I
I'm doing something, cooking or reading a book to my girl, well you know I let it ring
um um
and then I call them back, look mom sorry, or so-and-o, sorry
of course, of course that makes sense, besides now with the cellulars one can see who's calling, like that is I don't know, I mean if I'm going to see my friend
and my friend is calling me, well I answer because I know we have to make plans for tomorrow
exactly
but if it's someone else I'll call them some other time, I mean I think is a matter of having a little common sense, but people think that always. Another thing is that the young people, I'm a teacher, the young people
love the cellular phones, they always have them, a cell phone always rings in the classroom, I don't know how many times a cell phone rings in my classroom
yes, I know
and I say, you're in school to learn not to be answering the phone.
exactly
besides they are there with all their friends, I don't know who's calling I mean one imagines, they are in high school but one imagines that the majority of the
kids in high school their friends, are also in the same school
you assume that yes
I mean because, those phones that are calling, are the parents calling, I don't think so
no, exactly but, aha mom, my mom is also a teacher and she goes through that a lot
um what does she teach? your mom,
she teaches Spanish in high school also
Oh okay, okay, I teach English English to the immigrants
oh, ESL
ESL so
okay but my, my daughter well she got unlucky with me, because she is going to say that I'm like old fashion or I don't know what because she is not going to have a cellular
when she's twelve or thirteen years old she's not going to be going around with a cellular
no, twelve of thirteen no, is that my students many are already like seventeen, eighteen, they are pretty big
oh yes but I, I have seen that they are like twelve, thirteen, you know, they are entering seventh, eight grade and it seems that since they are
want to be older, well they pressure their parents a lot and so their parents give it to them
um um
and I don't believe in that
yes, yes
Me when she's seventeen years old then I'll buy her the phone and
yes
and that's to call- call me
and you only have one daughter?
yes only one, I'm a single mother
okay
and so, is the only one I have now
but well, you are taking good care of her
yes the same with the playstations and that, I tell her no, no, no
Hey! my name is Gloria
good evening, how are you?, I'm from Atlanta my name is Norma
oh good! and you?
W meet each other again right?
ha i talked to the lady yesterday that dreamed about you , she was from philadelphia.
ha
her name is silvia and we talked about the same thing, we talked about the cellphone.
oh yea
yeah
mhm
and do you remember about the cell phone?
Sorry?
We have to talk about the cell phone.
yeah yeah
about cell phones.
ha
and do you like them?
well,
And do you agree with the people that keep on talking?
um, well, no, i don't really agree, because they keep talking and its kind of of dangerous, they cant get distracted, or get bad news.
I know that, they are in shock, and they go and I know, there are going to be some accidents because of that, no?
aha
No, but I mean, on the other hand, the other hand, cellphones have become extremely necessary. No, for an emergency, if something happens, you sometimes can't reach a land line.
you don't have one close but at least you have your cellphone with you.
aha, aha
So, what do you think about that?
I don't like them, I don't follow, I mean, I talk, I, I, I scream at people that are in the tour and talking on the phone, I go ballistic!
aha
because they are not paying attention, they are talking on the phone, not paying attention in whether it did eat the light or if it didn't eat the light or
aha
I mean, they are arguing. One day I was with a friend and her husband was arguing with her and I said, hang up! Hang up, you are going to make me mad, you are going to try and kill me because you are now mad at him.
aha
And nowadays, children are using it a school. We have to take them away. It really bothers us that kids bring their phones to school. They loose them, we have to look for them
we have to dial, they go crazy, like this was the last bill they had in their pockets. Ah, and they don't respect, they disrespect the teachers.
Teachers ask them to turn them off, and they don't the put them on vibrate. It's stupid, really stupid, specially in school.
All those kids, they loose the phones, they loose them and we collect, we gather around twenty to twenty five phones and we tell them not to bring them to school,
but they don't care, they still do it
Sure,
They still bring them to school,
Sure, that should be, that shouldn't be allowed, I mean, I agree that they should only be used for emergencies, right?
Exactly.
And there are none, but when it's something, for example, at school, what do kids need cell phones for?
Exactly.
No, they are going there to study, they are not going there to speak to their friends, they are going to study
aha,
No, and, ans when one is driving, it's really dangerous that ones is, you know, eh, driving and speaking on the phone
Exactly
yes, it's very because, how you say it, they don't pay attention, no, but sometimes it's sometimes it's convenient, no? but it has its advantages and disadvantages.
yes, of course, but yes, yes, but, you know one day I told a mom: you now, that you shouldn't send him with his cell phone
Ah, but that's how I communicate with him, and i told her look: he can use the phone here in the office, at any time he wants
If it's an emergency, you call here and we look for him,
Sure
She says: No, but, you think that, that that, that I bought the cell phone so that he keeps it on top his dresser, this and that, I say: look
then I will tell the principal to start taking it away, to take it away first thing because if, if ones of the rules of the school is, not to bring
that you don't bring cell phones, he is not. You cannot send him with his cell phone, you are guilty if they tell him off. And they still don't tell them off, they should tell them off
very hard, so that they don't do it again.
Sure, I mean, that parents also are the ones that really, as they say, education starts at home, no?
eh, yes, yes, yes
The kids not even the parents educate them, they don't get their kids used to good things, good manners
aha
Or to do thing that are appropriate then
yeah
not even the children will not learn not understand
Exactly, yeah
mhm
Eh let me see what else
I am telling you I had a party yesterday
hmh
and she called me to come later,right then i could not find the place,she kept calling me she called me like lets say fifteen
times in less then three minutes.
Ay my God.
And I let the cell phone I will not let this this woman to cause me an accident
yeah
so I can get to her party in a hurry. and anyway I was close to her home. and she told me to go to the other side of town.
Ah,yes
yes after I was two blocks from her house,she said no is on the other side and then I come again and say I will not listen to her
I am following the directions,the directions that I have thru the internet
yeah
and got here the best, I say next time I will not even call her. because she was making me crazy with the dumb cellular
ay,yes yes the persons today
Ay, My God.
they are many times addicted to the cell phone,
yes, yes, yes
Ah, nothing happens, they take their cell phone to see, to find someone to talk to
Yes, yes, it is true, it is true.  My husband, my husband tells me: ay always, I am not going to buy you a new cell phone because you always leave it here
you believe, you have to charge it as if it were your purse, and I say:  I am not going to charge it like my purse because
I the, my son is the most important thing to me and he is in school, and if something happens to him they call me,
Of course
and if something happens to you, the ambulance calls me, why am I going to have a cell phone if, that when we say an accident once in the highway
You know then it comes in handy,
Of course, for certain things I say, for emergencies, No?
yes, yes, yes
really, eh Many times you don't need it but many times there are no things that you really you, no don't need for example earlier there weren't celu, cellular phones that you
a few years ago there weren't cell phones, there wasn't internet or something
I know right,
there you were living well that nothing was lacking, you weren't missing something
Exactly,
I don't know , yes, like we live in a consumer society then that's why
yes
many times publicity all the marketing, I don't know.
yes
It makes me think that we really need something, yes, we need it
yes, exactly, and how do they do it?, the IPO us something else
Mmm
Each boy must have than music, and listen it and all that, Oh my God!, and in the movie theater, he said that we needed to talk
about if it's used in movies. An the movie theater all start to talk, and they ruin the movie if you go there
I stopped going there, I'm tired to hear everyone in their cellphone, also in the train, in the train like it's
outside their house
Yes, in the train
You can hear all the conversation, all the conversation of everyone near you, the one in front of you
I don't like it, I don't like also my own cellphone, I put it in vibration, and of somebody calls it must wait to
get out of the train. I'm kind of crazy, my friends tell me: Gloria, you really have, I say, you go to the Highway
You are going at 50 and talking, and I don't think you can follow the conversation and the road, I found it really wierd, because when I
I don't get on the Highway, but when I do, I can't talk to anyone
On the cellphone, Oh My God!, it drives me crazy, that phone, that cellphone drives me crazy
Of course, now everyone has a cellphone, Everyone is woth their cellphone
I know
Talking with cellphone, from here to there
I know, I know. I don't let my children to take it to school, he has one only to emergencies
No
So he tells me : Mommy but it an emergency happens, so I tell him : You go and since I work at the school they let you call me.
They already know that you are my son,
mh
they let you call me. You know, but we limit the telephone to the whole world so that the cellulars don't don't come and still
They don't listen, and you tell them not to use them and they're in the Hallway They go into the bathroom,
Ah, yes
In the hallway They go behind the door, oh horrible, horrible these kids, of today. Oh ! My God Horrible. Even in church, in church today a poor woman
Of course, he's a child, uh huh
her cellular rang as if it were a bell. And even the father when he was praying stopped. And says : what's that a door ?
And he did it like a joke
Ah, of course
but and he did it like a joke, so then he said that when one comes to church it's to pray, not to ask the ringing cellular
So, she felt bad and she went outside. After when she went outside and the cellular began to ring again, and, and the whole world, the whole world began to laugh
because this lady was already, I said Oh, let her go already interrupting the concentration that you have in church. You know, so
Of course, yes, when we go to the temple, our temple, also there
uh huh
No, there is uh, people have their cellulars and before the conference begins there the the leader, uh tells them to please turn off their cellulars so that they don't interrupt,
uh huh and people still don't turn it off right ?
yes, some turn it off No ?, but some still don't there they
Some turn it off
have and sometimes makes noise, no?
I Know what a lack of respect Isn't it?
Oh, yes, really
Like the adults don't pay attention, that is why the children don't pay attention either
hmm
Because they follow the role of their mom and dad.  You know, I am so tired, Now I am, I am helping my son with his homework
Oh, okay
We are writing, having breakfast home.  He has to write eight sentences about the cell That because he has a cell and he can live without a cell and he can use it at the cinema
he can use it when he goes to dance, that this, that they Also use it for games Now I use the cell as a calculator
Oh, yes
Because I can use it as a calculator. And, and, and the other Oh, it has one good thing I put my appointment on the cell
Oh, that can be true
yes, the only bad thing is that if I then can not find the cell I don't remember Forrell, and I set it do it beeps me, so that when it reminds me that
today I have an appointment In that sense it is good, yes
yes for some things No? that is fine No?
yes I carry it with me aha
But Too much addiction Already is already too much
I Know

Exactly
They only can make twenty-five calls, no more
And you can't be of those twenty-five, all others can call    you, you don't have to call ?
I, i guess so don't know, ah because to me yes

Hi, good evening, I'm Lorena
Lorena, nice to meet you, you're talking to Lina
Hi Paulina, ¿how are you?
Fine, hey, you know, i didn't know what's the subject
i was going to ask you the same, because i can't hear it well, i think that i, no, it wasn't clear, i heard something about the internet.
Oh, something about the internet, yeah, the thing is that my husband was
about the
pressing the button, and he said "here, it's your turn", and i didn't hear a thing.
No, no, but, but, uh, it wasn't clear, uh, if i was taking
yes, you don't have an accent, a very strong accent.
And i couldn't really hear it, and even this is very difficult, difficult.
Yes
And, er, i was connecting the dots before i took the call, but the last i understood was about the advantages, it said something like what have been the advanages
Right
The most important dates for you in life, i understand, and which are the, i don't know, the least important, and after that something about the internet, that in your opinion
Right
Which are the advantages and disadvantages
and disadvantages of using internet
of using internet, and in the end, it says: "also give us your opinion and talk about that", maybe we can start meeting other people by the mean we are in now.
oh
on the phone I've been very possitive, I love it, I never thought it was going to be so much fun
yeah, have you met lots of people?
interesting well only three or four persons.
I see
but it really is like an adveture
yeah, where are you from?
from Mexico from Mexico City
from Mexico, from Mexico City, yes
and you?
from yes, from Chile, yes
oh from Chile, Chilean empanadas are yummy
oh have you eaten
sure
that's good
yeah in Mexico city when my husband was doing his master
oh yeah
there was, how was it called, the academy of Latin American social sciences
yeah, sure
there were students from all over Latin America and then well there was always an occasion where his Chilean or Argentinian friend invited us to eat some dishes, right?
sure I imagine
yes those empanadas how wonderful, unforgettable
that's great, Mexican food is very famous as well
yes yes yes yes and where are you calling me from?
from Athen, Georgia
from Georgia, I am in San Antonio, Texas
yes, I live in Athens oh very well, au
and have you been here long?
in United States well in Georgia we have been just two years but in the United States I have been eleven years already
yes wow eleven years and about and and just two years
and you? I see, no that is fine, that is fine
yes, well well just starting, starting our stay and you came here to study or how was it
yes I got here I got out to see I came here I was almost eighteen, I got out of the you call it high school no?
hmm
in Chile we call it middle school but well I left school and finished and I came over here to live with a family for one year and then I applied for university and
and beg-. and ehm I stayed here I studied and all
wow how great, how great that's good no?
like that yes and you have been here for two years
aha just two years because we were waiting for my children to finish their middle school as well
oh yes they finished in Mexico
Mhm, in Mexico they finished the secondary school and now they are here in high school.
Ok, yeah
Yes, yes, and
Very good, how many children do you have?
I have two now with me and one older who is studying the university. she left the house earlier.
OK
and she has two years studying in Pennsylvania.
Oh, that's good that she is studying.
Yes, she is studying chemistry engineering.
Oh very intelligent, right?
Yes, and very hard-working, awesome, well, what are you studying?
Oh, i have studied two careers, Translation and Micro-Biology
Oh, how nice is the Micro-Biology, i like it so much.
Yes, if you like it is fine
yes, yes, yes, i have studied Social Antropology and also English teacher.
Oh very good
Mhm, and i was a teacher in Mexico
OK
But definitely the situation here about salaries is much more better, and also i have some family here.
Oh yes
then we were good for San Antonio
we moved to here
giving things yes yes yes yes. and you already have the child?
I have two good children, one who is turning two next week, and the other is a new born
ohhh
boys will be boys so
yes yes yes then you're not working at the moment
no, I'm at home
clear and good to enjoy it
I listen and the dishwasher is safe
yes I'm listening to your advice for a good way to use the time
time if
then how many people have you met this way
I know you were touched that they called the other day, but there was no call
if the same thing happened to me two or three times
yes
that is the call or not to enter the
and it makes use of the whistle and then no one is on the other side
and then no one is on the other side, exactly
yes, so I just talked to the lady, she was married to a man from Mexico, she was not from North America
ah, okay
ah
yes, but this is interesting, no? I mean, I didn't understand
yes
at first and now that I've been talking, it really is
well, I know
one recovers the importance of talking, no?
yes
Because with this life, always in a hurry and running around, with so many things to do, well, sometimes one doesn't even phone one's friends to say hi and ask how they are, right?
there's no time, yes
then one has to value what's important
and besides one can get to know people too
yes yes yes yes yes
a little more
but to dedicate a few minutes washing the dishes for example to make a phone call, it's, it's important
you can use the time, no?

oh ah yes we already talked about that, no?
aha well yes I love it actually it has been novel, it is incredible
yes
what well this they are getting us back on the telephone it is useful and it is important, no?

ah yes but he has yes
no but certainly
yes if I spoke with them I have them my commentary I said they have to at the least

he said that they're getting someone who speaks Spanish and that they will see if they can do the the recording
no yes yes it's yes, yes
yeah because they can't even be understood, one that I had to listen to twice
of course
because I didn't understand what she was saying about going and I don't know what else
yes me neither and finally I I under-, I don't understand that word
one presses any number because no
I I press four because I can understand that it's a no? that it's a wire less telephone well wireless
uh huh,
I hope that that's it if not well total I've already passed the um test and I pa-, they communicate me and then hey and you have a lot of family in Chile, all of your family members
Hello?
Good night, my name is, and I live in Connecticut.
This is Annie, from Miami, we've talked before.
Oh, Miami, ah, And how are you baby?
Goo, and you?
Good, thanks and the baby, sleeping?
She's fine. Yes, thank God.
She should be resting, at least.
yes, now that I put her to bed.
Oh, that's good.
And you how are you?
good. I was watching, I was watching a show here on the TV, that I like to watch on Wednesdays.
Oh, that's great. I feel like I've got a cold, I have a really bad sore throat.
Oh, I've got allergies, but aside from that, well, I've taken vitamins to get rid of it.
That's what they say, but, but since I'm pregnant, I can't take many things.
Oh.
And that's how I am, you know. I'm just not feeling that well today.
No
But,
Ah.
Anyway, I don´t
The conversation is about Internet. Do you use it, internet?
I do, that's like my, I use it every day. We, uh, you know, we have e-mail, we have uh, we do everything we need to do with the bank
I look for information, recipes, go to the library
Hmm
I don't buy a lot, but, if we're going to buy something, I always do, uh, research
yeah, yeah
Eh, looking for the products, seeing where I can get the best price. So, for us, internet is like, you know, having a
encyclopedia, if I may put it this way
Hmm
at home
yes, it's good. I lik- I use it too to look for jobs, to find information, for my girl's schoolwork. But, for
things like, looking for people on internet, I don't like it
No, me neither
I don't believe in, I think you can find, there are many crazies, a lot of garbage that they put online and
then it turns out it's not true. There are lots of people who've used it and then gotten married. But I, I have never used
Well, I
those chat rooms they talk about
yes, Eh, and
I've never chatted with anyone
I used, eh, get into, into the chat rooms. But, weren't, of, you know, for looking people, or wherever, were of diferet topics.
But, no, it wasn't anything, eh, you know, after a while, I didn't liked. Because, the people I don't know, saying things like that,
that
wasn't that true.
yes, or, or that normaly doesn't say, you know, as it got rough,
Ajá, Ajá, Ajá.
and I didn't liked at all. So, after a while, as one of two months, y let go. But, because I prefer talk with people, not, you know,
be there, in front of a machine.
Ajá, Ajá.
But, you know, I have one.
And, this, this is also brought many problems to the couples, i found.
Yes.
Because, has separate to many couples that the husbands are get to, or women are get on the internet and met people and, spend hour there, and hours, and hours, and hours lost in there, in the internet.
I do not, I do not used like that, but, my nice send me jokes of Puerto Rico, and my son send me pictures of the baby, the new baby, that's why I liked very much the service.
Because, I can see my granddaughter all the time, and know how is all the months.
Yes, that is something that we do too. We take pictures of the child, and we send to all the friends, and to all, well, now not every month, but, it was every months before.
Ajá, Ajá.
And, I like a lot because, so, at least the people that we know, the family that is away from us, they can see how she is growing.
Yes, that is something that we do a lot, I forgot the pictures.
Yes, the picture is, is something nice, i love it. But, so, eh, I do not like it much, that it was saying that, you know that you send pictures and they keep them in a
filed for a time, and then, after e-of is- I think is after six month. Or something like that, is that, like tha the delete la,la
the program like delete it if you have not take it
well, with us, mine girl has almost 2 years old and never, never with had that, the pictures still there, Is that, depends, you know
of what arenyou using.  But, we had pictures, still, in the internet of, of, since when, my babyshower
Ah, well, when, I noy, I do is that I don't let them in the computer, I put them on a CD.
ah, well, ahhh
and I put it the date, and we put a, a make a label, then, I have them. if someone of the family come, then we put them on the TV and the computer
ah,,that is good, that is a good idea.
ahhh, ahh, yes because, if you leave them in the computer, that, takesnto many megabytes, I think.
well, I always make copies, before, I put them in the compuert
ahh
oh, sorry, in the internet, I always make a copy and all that
mhm
them, this is, I had the originals, that took.  We take about one hundred and fifty each month
ahhh
but, nothing else I put in the internet, let say, thirty or forty.  then, I keep the originals and I put them in the internet, because the ones in the internet are the
you know, fix, you know, the best.  I always have 2, 2types from the cd. Then, when she grows, if she wants all the pictures, I can put them, look these are the best and these are the originals, what ever you want.
ahhh, yeah
she has them, but
Yes
I had never thought of putting it on the, on the TV.
yes, you can, but you have to, I think, that the - CD program whatever, to see it - TV then, you buy a cable, I think that for the camera, and
yes
and, and you have it on the TV. That's what we do. Every time we have a party, well, we put it
in the CD. Then, when the family comes, you put it- we get together, and everyone sits in the living room and, they see it, on the TV you can see it nicer.
Mm, eh, yes, that's a good idea.
because is also a bigger screen. And, if you put music to it,
yes
well, they looks nicer. That's why I like the internet, but, for the rest of, of couple, they don't get me.
Me neither. And, and also, like what you said before, that, you know, you never know who you are going to meet.
No, but, look all those kids that they sometimes kidnap, that, that meet these crazy men on the internet.
yes
Here there was a girl, that a guy seduced, and from New Jersey, ah he was forty something and the girl was how old? she was fifteen
and he took her. Luckily they were able to get her. But, God knows if he takes her and kills her. And, I don't like it too much either for the matter of the kids, sometimes.
Neither, yes, that is something that, that I already know, that when, you know my kid is more, let's say older, that the computer will
I will have to change it from the room is in. Because, right now we have it like in, not in the office, but, let's say, that's what we are calling it.
And,
Is a separate room that you use as an office.
yes. But, I want to put it, let's say, in the living room or, you know, some place where when they are, they are using it, I can see
everything they are doing. Because, since I used to be a teacher before, I know, you know, what kids do.
mmh, mmh.
like they hid from the parents and things like that, and not that-
Yeah
I don't want to say that my
yes, they when you go, they changed the screen.  What do you do? Well, my grandchildren, sometimes I tell them, what do you do? No, nothing, here.
yes, it is
And I open the screen they have, to see
So,
But, you have to be watching them because the computer is a little, it has lots advantages and also has its disadvantages.
Ah,
Because, look all that information that sometimes it gives you for those, those terrorists to make bombs.  Even the same students those who, who killed those people at Columbine School there are
yes.
they took the ideas from the i- from the internet.  So, sometimes, I mean, it has its, its good side, like everything.  Like all they take, that it has good things, and then, it has other points that, well,
are disastrous also.
It all depends on how it is used, you know? yes that, but, no, I, I, I love internet, but, I also know that when,
you know, if you start to, no if you start, but, when children start using it, it has to be a bit different.
Aha, aha.
you know.  Because I believe that many times, they don't
yes, now, now, well, now they have invented so many things with parental control and all that that,
yes.
that, at least, one, well, with that one can control them a little more than before.  But, in beginning that there wasn't any of that, well, you know that they kids would get in, in the chat rooms, ehm, they would open twenty thousand things.
Well, and, and still that, that happens, even though I have the parental controls.  Because, many times, when I go to, to search my e-mail, you know, and I know that this would happen to, to some of my students, that they go to open the e-mail,
and picture of, you know, of, of nude women, come out, whatever
Hmm
And, and that is something that, that bothers me a lot, that I don't know how is it that you can change that.  You know?
Oh, it is, it is people that, ehm, when y- I think that if you leave the, the password, and don't close the, when you go to look at your mail,
if you don't close well the, quickly the- oor, let's suppose, you, you go to cook or to do something, and you leave it there, an open space,
many, there are many men that, many people that know how to get your, get your password at that moment that you have left it there for, for, for a long time, that's why it says that as soon
you are going to leave the computer, well, you take and close it.  Do you understand me? To ensure that nobody can take your information.  Well, then they what they do, that when they already take your password, they come and start to send
t- these, e-mails that, that, sometimes, what they bring are viruses, sometimes what they brins are drity things.
yes
So, it all depends on, that is, at least one must be very careful with the, with the passwords, and with the information, especially the banking one and all of that
when sometimes they request information, that you, that they tell you to enter your pin again because,
yes.
there, one has to be very careful.
No, thank God, us, you know, things like that over the computer no, they have not happened.  But, if somebody if they stole the, teh number of, of
social security
Aha
of my husband a few years ago.  And we had a, many problems.
Oh, yes, well, that is the, the identity theft.  Well, that is being used much now in,
Why
with the help of internet they steal you all of your personal info. That's why, whenever, you know sometime, they tell you that you get, what do i know? , free stuff and they offer you thousand free things on internet. And you start filling all that and then
when they start asking things like mothers name, birth date and all that, then, it's not OK to put all that info
Hello good evening
Hello, good evening, I'm Nicole, I'm speaking from New York
I'm Norma here from Atlanta, Georgia
Hello, how are you?
Fine, And you?
Fine, fine have we spoken before, or no
um, I don't know
No, no, I spoke to someone from Atlanta
Aha, yes
But, I don't know
mm
What country are you from?
I, I am Peruvian
ah okay eh
And you?
I, well my family is Cuban
aha
eh But I was born here in the United States
ah, okay and then What's your opinion of the nol?
Of telesales, I don't like it, I don't know who likes it
yes
those people who call to sell anything, uh, I don't know.
No, you are, you are referring, to, to, you are referring to telemarketing, seems to be pop-ups on the internet or that, that call on the telephone.
uh, no I think they are talking about when they call you
ah, when they call on the phone.
When they call on the phone they sell questions and also when
ah,
when they send emails
ah, spam, yes,
of course they're selling, spam
aha
As if, I don't know, I don't know if this convinces anyone, I have never, never bought anything I saw in any email like that, seriously
yes
i don't know
ah, me neither, i don't think what, that, i have bought hings on the internet, online
yes I, uh, bought things on the internet but not
but not from what they send in spam
of course
no, no other things that one really needs, no
of course, of course, well, it should be, it should be effective.
no, and
It must be that someone sees those emails and is convinced, because if not
Yeah, sure. Surely there are people who invest in it, so for example they don't send all those emails and
um
and the small companies, or I don't know who, does that, then your money is invested.
sure.
Right, and with the telephone it's really annoying, especially when you're busy.
mhm, right.
yeah, annoying.
I don't know if you've tried to use those lists that say they don't call
uh huh
Like, you can sign up for a list and with that it's not supposed to call you or they stop calling you, but I'm not sure
I'm signed up and they still call me sometimes.
Yes, of course.
But not as much, not as much as before.
Mhm, yeah sure, sometimes the telemarketers are so insistent.
Um yes, but I always say I cannot talk right now and hang up, because I do not want to listen to the whole story that they're going to tell me because I know that I am not going to
Uh huh
I'm not going to buy anything.
Of course I am not interested.
hmm
yes sometimes there are people, and sometimes there are what do they call it scams they call them, that sell you something and there are times when at the end it wasn't true, that alsu happens
yes yes, yes alsu
they offer counterfeit things
yes
they offer to sell Over the phone even over the internet also
yes it must be a terrible job to have that job my sister did it for about a week
Oh yes, yes, many family members that were employed there
and she would get home crying every day because everybody
nobody wanted to buy
sure, no, nobody wants to listen to you, I mean
yes, not even listen
I mean everybody hangs up on you, and she would arrive like that so affected that she stopped working like that in one week
Of course, really they are a job very, it is not very no, no worth it that much, it will be harder to swallow
no, and on top of that they procure you, when one has a job like that they preccure you oh,
sure
oh, to have sales, I mean they are like like listening to you, while you are making the call the bosses are listening to you
yes
to se how you are selling and if you are not
to they pay you per commission for sure
sure and if you are not very efficient they kick you out or they pay you less that is how it is bad for work, sometimes I fell a little sympathy for people
yes sometimes one things, well it is a job that they are doing just like any other job, no
sure sure, like, like they too are trying to make their money, but I do not want to give them money that is the problem
hmm hmm
ehm I don't know but what it is, is that I answer the surveys, I mea if if they call me with surveys so that he wants to know
aha
that I am going to vote and for whom am I goint to vote, I don't know what I think about the political cituation now, that I do answer on the surveys
hmm
I think that it is good ehm, that they have one, I mean diverse opinions
sure
and I like to contribute with something like that, because it is like for investigations or for
mm like research
sure But, they are not asking me for money, just answers, I give opinions, but not dough ehm
sure because now you never know who it really is, no, truthful, who is lying
Sure Sure, no besides I do not want, what they are selling me, the newspaper I do not want, that is I mean, that is I read the news over the internet
and I don't want newspapers in my house
yes
ehm, and I don't know what else what else they sell, life insurance, I do not want it
Insurance, vacations
hmm, that you won a car
that's it, that is really
you just have to go to Miami and look for it
or yes, you won this, but you have to send money to ensure your prize.
Sure.
Is quite a matter
Sure, not in most things
Uhm.
they are all making money, but if it wasn't for that they would not be making money.
sure
someone has to pay for these peoples salaries
yes we really have to be careful and not
uhm sure, another thing is that sometimes.
no
they call you and say they have- leaving a message saying to such a number to claim your prize
yes
and the number turns out to be one that charges money for dialing it.
uhm
in other words is like a nine hundred number a nine hundred that charges you for calling, so that
ah, in addition to this you have to pay the long distance call  besides that you have to be very careful. No award lots prizes to many people to get more business
Uhm.
No, that's a way, a way of advertising they say
I think it's cheap, i mean, i think it's very cheap of that company, to do that kind of advertising, i mean they probably pay very little
to, to the people that's calling
yes
In fact, sometimes that people that's calling isn't even here in the United States.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true
But they have like communication systems
Uh um
that allow people to be calling you from India
Oh yeah, right
And you can't tell, since they speak English in India
Yeah, their accent
i mean, they do like outsourcing
Right
like they pay people in those countries to, to call you, to sell you stuff, ¿can you imagine?
Uh
How little they must be paying those people
Right, because in India they don't pay much for that.
They're making calls, so if they make one or two sales for each person, maybe they're making profit, right, i mean, they do it for that, because they can't
i mean, they must not be selling a lot like that. But since they don't pay much to their employees, they must make very little profit of that
of course because in, in India it's a completely different way of life. And there you pay, you pay less to people
Sure as it is a very poor country
aha, so these people are anxious to work in whatever job, no
um I hear that once that, that when like help desk when you have a problem with your computer or something like that and you call for help, that many times the person that answers is in India.
yes, yes it's true, even eh, here they big ones, for example the telecommunications company here in the South, Bell South
mhm
No and always, sometimes my husband calls, I he calls for some problem with the phone, with the Internet we have and yes, yes, the people that you call, that answer are in Idia
sure sometimes the communication is very bad
no yes mhm sure, and one, sometimes they don't understand because they don't speak
sure or sometimes it's as if there is a delay, like you hear and don't hear
mhm mhm
what happens to those communications if I'm calling the phone company and the connection is bad but it's that they're far, that's incredible
Sure, now yes
incredible to think of that, because even they're in another time zone, there must be twelve hours of difference with India
I suppose that there must be people that work, what do I know, all the time, no
sure or, or they work at night
Or they work, yes they work at night
that people must call much more during the day than during the night here so those people must be calling at night I say, that is working at night over there
I mean if it's three in the afternoon here
yes more or less mhm
good, I don't know, I don't know, em maybe I don't know, or maybe it's worth it for that people, maybe they are better than the other jobs there
right, well what else should we say so the twelve minutes are over
right,  it's a little, talk about this topic. Sometimes the topics he gives
Mhm
There is not much to day
Clearly, like the last time they called for that, about the dates
Yes
that they call in order to set up the dates
To set up the dates, because they translate from English
Yes it is a
It is a machine that is translating from English to Spanish
It is a question not a question, I said, what is to make dates? I don't understand very well
To set up dates, I also I was listening to set up dates what would setting up dates mean
Yes
And after dating in English, date should be dating to date
Yes instead of dating
What, what an oversight, a study of language
ah yes
it is supposed that this is a linguistic study
Clearly
and they can't translate the words well into Spanish
Clearly, clearly, that is not that best that it doesn't give the complete translation or the appropriate translation
Clearly, it's not a machine, it is a
hello
hello good afternoon
hello good afternoon, ehm I am Nicole from New York
uhm, here I am Norma from Atlanta, Georgia
hello, how are you?
fine, and you?, we talked yesterday, right?
no, yesterday not because yesterday I did not make any phone calls, but we talked before
oh, okay, oh, yes, yes
but about this topic I don't recall no maybe about this same topic about the telesale
yes, yes, I think that we did talk
yes, we talked I think it was on Friday
aha
we talked about this same topic how stupid
aha
what else are we going to say
yes, that is what I was thinking
well, let's talk about something else because, what are we going to say we are not going to have the same conversation as before
sure, because I don't and I don't think that somebody is going to be much in agreeance with the telesale
no, uh, you are Peruvian
yes, I am Peruvian
Oh, right, and ¿how, how long have you been living here?
Ten years, right
ten years, and ¿do you have family here or?
no, no, no, i - c- i came to no, but the temple i belong to
right
there aren't any, but the religious association i belong to, so, i came for that
oh, OK
that way, uh um,
and, ¿did you came when you were little or an adult?
no, i came when i was, let's see- i came in ninety five
um, right, right, ¿and what do you do in Atlanta?
¿what do i work on?
uh um
no, er, i don't work, my husband works
oh, right
,
that's good
I'm with the kids here at home, well, they're gone now
right
they left me here alone, to rest,
How many children are there?
I have two, two little men who are
two children, what's that?
two men
ah, yeah
and should not be imagined as not, men are always more active
yes, yeah I guess, I grew up with my sister, that is, the two girls so
ah, you
I do not know how they are
oh and, are they not married?
no, no not yet
ah, aha
and I live, I live alone, but about my parents
ah, okay
mm
ah, is that where the truth is?
I am twenty seven years old
ah, you see, I am forty one
if not me, me or my family would love to have a marriage and be a family but
mm
I do not know, so far no
does not appear, the right person
no, I do not know my boyfriend as well, or perhaps get along
mhm
but it takes a year, that is, we met a year ago
mhm
so we're expecting it a little
mhm
but maybe I certainly hope so
yes, yet you're young
yes, we are
if so, when you get married and it's different,
Clearly
no and there are more obligations
clearly
it's not the same freedom as before especially if you have children
of course, I like to not live alone, sometimes if only slightly, as I like to go out, do things
mhm
see other people because if not, it's like but not too lonely, all at the time, I think
clearly, that if that is true but stop or at least not now, I have this determination
sure
no Next to a little more of its or to deny a little more of his freedom I suppose that it must be like that, no?
sure, because, because it is a lot more work and when one has a family it is already a lot of work
yes
and I, I like to be alone, like how should I say it, I like, I like tranquility I like it like thinking and reading
hmjm
I think that when, when I have children
uhm
wow, it will be very difficult to do those things
oh, that sure is true you are right in that
so that
when the the children are little are babies and no way, one does not have time for even ea- not even eat nor even bathe
sure sure I went to visit a friend that has a daughter
aha
the daughter has, has about six weeks,
oh, yes a small baby
I mean very little and, I don't know my friend always with the, with the baby, I mean, she doesn't leave her
sure, with small babies it is like that, exactly, hmjm
I mean, she is with her atevery moment yes, but no she, she is very happy but, it is a huge responsibility until they have grown a little

ah, yes, look, yes.
I don't know if it has - if it would have heard
yes, I studied at the, at the university, I studied Buddhism
mhm

mhm, yes, yes a, we're vegetarians there aren't
And are there Hari Krishna in Peru also? should be
uh, yes? Yes, there quite a few temples in Peru, in, and around the world there are a lot of temples
mm and it, and the children are also vegetarians, right?
ah, certainly, of course.
there are.
and they have been vegetarians since the womb.
And they never ask to eat meat or anything like that?
nope, no it's the
Really?
up until now no, so, when they young no, they are and even though we didn't teach them to be vegetarians
sure
if not, they don't ask nor do they have any sort of inclination, of course when they become teenagers and well, when they begin to, to, what do I know? to ask about or something and and it's, well nobody can force them to do something that they don't want to do, right? It's a question they have to answer for themselves.
sure mm
they have, they're not children, they have free will as they grow older and
sure, sure
no, they have to choose, or see
yes, I was a vegetarian for many years
oh, yes? hmmm
I had been a vegetarian for like ten years, but then I went to Chile, I was living with a boyfriend there, and it was really hard to keep being a vegetarian because
hmmm
because he, he ate meat, and if I cooked vegetarian stuff
ah
and he placed like a piece of meat in there, like I didn't want to eat like that
ah, yes?
so I stopped, I stopped because it was like too complicated, and then, then when I came back I kept at it, but I don't eat too much meat
yeah
I never cook meat at home, I just
when you have big meals
sure, if I eat out, or if I go to someone else's house and they cook something, then yes, but at home only vegetables, and I don't know, legumes
I like, hmm, I prefer to eat like that
hmm
I mean
sure, it's, it's healthier, no?
hmm
is healthier and in fact your digestion is better
mm yes, the truth is that no, I don't like meat too much, I like fish
mm
I don't know, you guys eat fish or no?
no, no, we don't eat meat, eggs or fish
no, fish not really but the meat in reality no, it doesn't appeal to me too much
no and are you still with the same boyfriend?
no, we broke up
ah, good, now suddenly the other, the other boyfriend there suggest it to him, he's not inclined to eat meat, and you make him a vegetarian is easier you're a vegetarian
yes I've never been in a relationship with someone who's a vegetarian, never
mm
and, and I've had like five boyfriends
aha
like, serious boyfriends
aha
I mean, more or less serious
aha
but they all ate meat, and they really liked meat, in fact even the one I have now, also
aha
he likes hamburgers and chicken
and well,  some people are more inclined to, well, it's a custom, they were born and raised like that, right?
Of course
they were raised eating meat, and that there is not an alternative and then they listened something, but It's nothing they would ever have imagine, right?
Mmm
as a vegetarian, I really don't have anything to envy people who eats meat, I have been a vegetarian for 20 years
Mmm
And you really feel really healthy, and you even appear to have the age you have
Of course
If you are vegetarian
Yes, I like ti because
No, but it's different, yes
meat makes me feel really full, really heavy
of course, because it's really hard for human digestion, the human body is not made for eating meat, it's not meant to eat meat
But people is used to eat meat, they don't feel full if they don't eat meat
yes, because is not until you become a vegetarian that you learn how to balance your food
Yes, you have to be careful to eat proteins
Of course, you have to start looking for the proteins that you won't find in
yes
find in meat, like
Mmm
Tofu right? soya, eh different products? right? like that
Of course, milk and yogurt and all that.
ah, I a- we if we take, we are lacto-vegetarian
that, I see, I see
No yes, it's that there are so many things that you can ve- e- eat being vegetarian really I say, well, now that I am vegetarian you like
I don't understand how people can eat meat
sure, sure, it's like you get used to it and that's it
sure, and and you eat such nice things, no? being vegetarian that really you have nothing to envy, mhm
sure, no, I like, I like I also like very much I like very much Indian food that has many vegetarian things and the
ah, yes
Asian food in general, I like it a lot
mhm
Chinese food, Japanese food but well, that one I do like I like fish, that's it
ah, yes
but yes, eh, what were you going to ask me? I had another question but I forgot it, Oh, and do your children speak Spanish and English or?
well, not so much, they speak, eh, they know so- me words, they understand some Spanish, no? like that some, but really not much
sure sure, because with your husband they speak in, they speak in English
yes it's that no it's so di-, it's not so easy, no? I try to teach them Spanish but they speak English at school
mm
mainly the older one
mm
Hello, fine, fine, I'm Laya
Hello, how are you? What do you want to speak about, I didn't understand the
ah, yes, we have to talk about spam, about unwanted commercial publicity, telemarketing, you know, kind of when they call to your house to sell you stuff or they send you letters or emails, those types of things.
aha, no, on the phone, you have to get another phone because I can't get the volume up in my phone, I need to turn it up
she can't hear me
Ah, I heard you but I can't hear what the machine was saying
it's like, the machine speaks pretty bad Spanish
yes, yes, well she speaks Spanish with an American accent, do you understand
yes, besides that it has a terrible accent, I don't know many things, I don't really understand, yes, yes
well, it's because there are many words in Spanish and, not just words but the
idioms, yes, yes, yes, aha, yes, yes, yes
from many different countries, different regions speak in a certain way and name things in a certain way, like, I'm here in New York and I was talking to
someone from Puerto Rico and they name the oranges
mja, china
china, yes, I'd never understand that because china is to me, a person that comes from China!
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, mha, mha
a woman, but it's how they speak Spanish, it's something like, oh okay, lets speak about telemarketing right?
yes, yes, yes
you know, I'm in a list in which, I don't know if you know about this but there's a list in which you can put your name in and
aha, ahhhh
with the government and them, they cant call you like that, yes I think they still have that list and I don't know where
it is legally valid, you can't be sent unwanted publicity
they can send it to me but they can't call me
ah, they can't call you, okay, okay, aha, aha
no calling list, it started around, two, two and a half years ago, when the government started using that list because people were speaking, complaining
aha, aha
that they would call when they were sleeping or at certain hours during the day and all that, do you understand, so I included my number in that list
and they don't call you, it really works, aha, okay
no, not to request, no but if I don't pay my bills, they do call me
sure, yes, yes, it would be great if they didn't call for that too
yes, yes, but if I don't pay my bills they do call and also they send it through the mail, the mail, they are doing all sorts of things
aha, aha
and  I don't know if you have a computer or if you get that type of info through the computer
yes, yes, well, I've been living in the United States for only a  year so I don't think they've been keeping track of me, the marketing companies, so they don't call me, I don't get many of those calls asking me to buy stuff, no
aha
and I do get them through the mail but it's not that bad, however, it is a huge problem in the emails, I've got several email accounts and oh well
the private university here and every day I have to delete around fifty publicity related emails
mm
about watches, pills, treatments, everything
and where are you from, you said that you've been living here in the United States for how long?
I've been alone for a year, yes yes, I'm, from Spain from Barcelona
a year wow. What country are you from? ah you are Spanish, aha yes because I'm from Latin American, Hispanic
yes yes yes then, aha from Panama ah very good very good
yes but in Panama, in Panama is very commercial, a very small country, understand
yes I was in Costa Rica I was relatively close to Panama I was in Costa Rica last year
yes yes but Panama is much more developed than Costa Rica yes yes there's a lot
yes aha aha no because well to me Costa Rica seemed to be a country that is doing quite well that no
oh, yes
you didn't see poverty in the street and I don't know
yes yes well Costa Rica is the most democratic country in the American continent, yes eh
mm, mm,mm they also don't have an army right
it doesn't have an army and all its politic, the politic in Costa Rica is the most peaceful of all
mm yes yes
I'm telling you the truth a map there near the United States there they have different parties and each party one year you are in power, or two or three years you are in power and then another party and they do it perfectly
aha, aha
without an army or anything like that that the government needs to use force, understand
aha, yes very well yes yes
ah but many people don't know it but in Panama we have more businesses, more developed
mm, sure, sure, mm
because of the Panama Canal and see there are people there from all parts of the world in Panama there are people from all parts of the world there are many people that go there
mha
working in ships, right, with big ships, they are called Junk ship and the ship right, if they wanted to stay they would go and stay in Panama.
aha, aha, sure, sure, mhm
and they wouldn't go back to their countries, so, lots of people weren't able to leave, they had political conflicts back home and when they would get there, when they work int he ships, they
aha, aha, oh
they would get to Panama, you know, and they would flee the ship and just mix with the people from Panama and
sure, how many inhabitants does Panama have?  in the whole country?
ah, like three thousand, the whole country must be around three thousand
four, three thousand, wow, it's tiny, really tiny!
yes, it's a small country, but they have good businesses developing there, businesses, yes
wow, so tiny, aha, aha.
yes, tiny, just three thousand, three thousand people there but not, I mean, three million, not three thousand, three million oh, oh, oh, I mean three million, I'm sorry
ah, ah, ah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, three thousand I was like wow, it's even smaller than my village, I see three million, that's small too but it's not that small, three million people
three million, three million, no, no, that's it, three million people not three thousand, a friend of mine was here in Brooklyn, right, New York and I was at a library with business books
mja, mja, mja, mja
a library with business books and I noticed the yellow pages books from Spain and you know, do you know what the yellow books are? A yellow book is a phone list with phone numbers from bussinesses
yes, yes, the yellow guide, yes, yes, yes, yes, mm
the yellow, right, the yellow one from Spain and it wasn't as big as the one from Brooklyn and Brooklyn is such a tiny part of the United States, do you understand? New York city has five boroughs, right
yes, yes, yes, yes, mja, mja, mja, yes, yes, but it's full of people
Brooklyn is one of those boroughs and the whole pages for Spain weren't as
mha mha and you have many years over here
yes yes about thirty years but but if I have over thirty years here yes yes I have been here many years and I am more americanized than Latino
aha, no no it already knows shows by the accent when you speak English, when you speak English ehm I mean
Very good as well, the thing that depends on the person and
mha mha, of course mha mha mha
the education and that the people that you are with the whole time, understand because if you have gone to college or something like that you still continue talking a certain way, understand, because I am going to tell you the truth
mha, mha
oh I have a profressor, a teacher here of right I went to Brooklyn College she was the... a teacher of a teacher of of Spanish, of Spanish teaching
mha mha
but the class with her was on Spanish literature, understand like Don Quixote, Lazarillo de Torme and all of that
uhm yes I remember when I wos going to the institue
and I don't remember now Lazarillo de Torme the first, the first picarezque novel
mha mha, mha
the thing is that she was the worst teacher I have ever had in my whole life and she learned Spanish from the book no by speaking in her home
I see I see I see I see it is very different it is very different yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
like the machine, the machine that you heard but she speaks it better than the machine you see but she knew Spanish very good is that she had to study so much in Spain that when the moors had undertaking and all of that
mha
she hab to visit certain how do they call it in New York we have a museum right
mha, oh yes aha what museum is this one, aha
where they teach a lot about Spanish architecture, see and the influences that the moors have had oh in Spain's influence there is and we have certain words like the word ojala that is Arabic yes
i wish, there are a lot, there are a lot of Arab words in spanish, it's not
yeah, because when they say, i tell you, i wish we go to the movies tomorros and something like that, the movie, right
Right, oh, sure, sure, i never understood that, right, right.
I wish, but what I'm saying to you is oh Allah, the god Allah understands, but that's a different thing; but speaking about all that telemarketing and spam, you say you don't get a lot, huh
I don't get much, neither calls not paper, but i do get a lot in the mail, over the email, yeah, on my email, a lot.
No, no, of email, right, oh, please, oh, believe me, i get it by, i have Yahoo, ¿which do you have?
I, well, i have several, i have hotmail, gmail, I've got my American university's and my Spanish university's so
Oh, please
I spend all day looking at different emails, it's horrible, yeah, yeah
And not, not only horrible, but those people, they're very, ¿how do you say in english, right?, I'm saying, i'm practically telling you, ok, they're very, ¿how do you say it?, creative
What?, what?, what?, right, yes
They know how to write things that you'll want to read
and
or that says things you want to see what's inside, I'm telling you, they're very, ¿how do you say?, uh
yeah, they have imagination, they are creative
imagination, yes, their imagination, they're very
there's also one that i get almost every week, i get one written in french
Right
That's, well, it talks about, the lady who writes to me is the widow of an African dictator who has died, and that she has i don't know how many millions
Oh, oh, millions, oh, oh, oh
and that asks help to take out these millions and that in addition I mean
ah no oh and look those have increased a lot in the last six months ah
yes yes yes yes
The former has been raised much that tells you that I earned some in England and I have to go to England to claim my thousand pesos or dollars what they have and that oh, leave that
Ah, yes yes too yes yes I am wondering if someone really believes those stories no?
but they tell it yes yes
Because, I don't know, it looks incredible that someone could take the bait, thus if they send them is because, I don't know, somebody would take the bait
but look they send, a lot of them, they send it from another country and they send like two thousand, right, two millions
yes yes, yeah sure
and they expect for one or two people, you understand
yes yes yes nowadays it does not take any effort to send an email to millions of people, just to say, but, I don't know, it seems incredible to me that someone can take the bait
yes it is incredible that they say, one of them say that if some mister has like fifty thousand pesos if I do not answer
yes yes yes, yes yes such stories, some very impressive stories
fifty thousand, fifty millions and do not ans- and I don't...they are crazy and they are from many countries and they say many of them are from Nigeria, Nigeria and eh eh
yes yes yes from Nigeria and futhermore, as I am in the university we organize conferences
aham
then there is people that registers for the conference and after that they ask for money to come with, well, complicated stories that sometimes you do not know if people is true or false I mean with all that from the internet
oh
sometimes you do not know if if you are talking with someone real of if they are deceiving you completely, is
but the thing eh I do not believe that the government can, how could they, they cannot know who the person that is sending is, who or what is doing that
ah yes, it is hard because it is so easy to hide the identity not that
yes and the thing is that when they send all that letters yes eh, it is difficult when well it says, eh well you know that what they are trying to achieve their guys, you understand, the money but
mja

they might be convinced to buy something
They might be easily convinced
Yes, unfortunately
But I think that most of the younger people, l don't know, there must be young people who might be convinced. I think that busy people don't want to lose time in
in having a conversation like that one
Of course, and spam always
In my email all the spam is in a separate carpet
Of course
Email automatically does that
It's less annoying
That way, i don't even see those emails, i don't check that carpet, it's always there and the site eliminates everything after 30 days or something like that
And you never check if
almost never, sometimes yes, sometimes I go and see, but. And because they arrive in hundreds. Or rather, for example, now there must be like two-hundred and fifty, and I get bored looking at it.
I, I, if I look at it, every time I look at at my spam email because what has happened in the past is that I got emails that were not spam
um, yes
It has gone to the spam folder, most people do not look at it and it has happened to me that I write to someone
and they never answer me, and they never answer me
Maybe in the spam
and it was because it went to their spam folder and they never looked at it before erasing it. Do you know what I mean?
Of course
I always look at it, but very rarely, almost always in the, is fine, almost all the time, spam is sent to the spam folder
yes
and nothing of spam arrives at my inbox folder
that's great, that's great, what services do you use?
What?
What email do you use?
I have many, I have Yahoo, and Hotmail, I have many. And yes, they are fine, because, because the Spam is very protected, no virus can get in
umh, yes well, I never open the Spam emails but look through the list. like to see if someone, if another person has called, but no.
umh I do not open them because I believe
No, but, yes but even sometimes, you can get emails from people that you  know with virus
um  yes
And that does not let you open them, that's fine
yes that's what they say. Of course, I don't know it that really happens, I think you have to open, the email and also open the attachment like a
The one
a file, you have to open also something they send along with the email
yes
Because I don't think you can send a virus like that, by simply sending the email
No you have to download the whole file, but that's what hotmail doesn't let you do, it doesn't let you download the file
Oh that's better
Because the truth is there are a lot of tricks, those emails with viruses and many times it seems as if, as if a person that you know is sending you something that interest you.
um
And is, is a virus. In other words You have to be very careful. And the ones that send ads through the internet, in other words those that send spam are really selling things.
yes, yes
I, is that I don't understand that, who buys them.
Yes they are selling and also like pornographic things
yes, is almost always
I don't know pills,
yes everything that's illegal, they sell, that way.
hu
eh, pills that are not approved, that promise miracles and people believe it, is that I don't understand.
uh
who believes that
Well, there must be people, I don't know, I think there are people who allow themselves to be convinced by those things, they allow
yes, sure
I don't know, I know a woman that, yes, there are some emails that talk about someone, I don't know, like emails that say that someone in the government
needs help, and if you send them money, they'll give you back ten times more, something like that, and I know a woman
yes, she fell for that
yes, I mean, she always believes it, and she, she's not well. I think she's a little crazy or something, but she always believes it
She always believes it and she's lost a bunch of money
It's very dangerous, that's very dangerous, because many people have lost a lot of money like that
yes, yes, that's right, I mean, when you sell something, many people won't buy, but if they say
if they say you're going to make money, I mean if they tell you that if you send money they'll send you more, I think many people dream about that
yes, yes, there are people who fall for that
like that
I think it's lack of, of intelligence, that's not thinking, really, because, they're going to give me money for free? and how is it that I alone got the mail with so many people in the world who also have email
Sure, sure, but there are always people who think they are
yes
They are the only ones in the world who'll make money with that. I mean, there are people who want to dream about that
Sure
It's like, like gambling, I mean, there are people who gamble and think they're going to make a lot of money, even though everyone loses money with gambling
yes, practically, otherwise the bank, the casino wouldn't exist
Sure, sure. But there are always people who gamble and think they'll get rich
Yeah
And well, well While betting you can get some money, There has to be some, but only a few.
They go so they can have fun for a day, they go because there is no addition, and they have to play, and some professionally dedicate themselves, because there are games, like black jack.
Of course.
You have good probabilities if you play the game properly.
of course, Or poker as well, just a bit, right?
What i don't know.
yeah, in poker i think its like
I think it goes with it, i suppose
Poker is a physiological game, because nobody knows how much somebody has, no one knows.
Its a game like,
Well, in poker, i know, i saw a documentary about the people from MIT that had tricks to count their cards, that is illegal, of course, the casino is ready for it, you cant go against the casino.
Of course um
its not really a trick, A trick would be to mark the cards with something.
Of course, no no this is like
Cards in your sleeve, but if your are capable of counting the cards, why would it be a trick? so when it came, from casino to casino they would find out.
Of course
winning little by little, not winning a lot at every casino, but to have attention by other people, otherwise it would be prohibited to enter casinos.
ha, look
they had to go Europe to win at casinos in europe.
ha
was curious
look
but, but no one is
But i think is good to have some people win because we always lose money, some that win must exist
obviously no one gives money, the world wants believe
um
Is, is very strange that someone can give away something, very strange. They always search something in return. And the lists, you put your number
yes, and I'm registered
And it works ?
Same, sometimes they call, butt not much. Like few times than before. And is delayed a little before it starts working, like a few months
And from there it shows, they tell you, we will put you on the list, and the list start three months from now
But from there you can realize they have fewer calls
Good
Equal you always have people that call, don't know but
The bad thing about the list is not mandatory, like if you put your phone on that list, they probably will not call you
um
But it isn't, simply, a list for the not wanting the trouble to call the people
um
you already told them not to call you because is a waste of time and money
Um
But yes there are other companies that do not care y in case they try it anyways
Clearly
It is them that do not watch the lists y who call you and make you lose equal time
Yes, yes I believe that no, not all the companies that
And they lose money
They pay attention to the list or perhaps, I don't know perhaps not all of them have the list, I don't know who gets the list
?
It's less, this way, I don't know, if you have put your name here, but your number here
I know, yes
But they still call
Not a single one calls me, I am lucky, my phone was new
Um
I put nothing more January I put it on the list and the calls that I've received are from services of companies with which I have some kind of service.
How nice
They still want to sell me more services
Um
So this is also very annoying
Um
But the next time is that they called from the same bank
um hu
they called me various time for the same reason, i will tell them to put me on the list
to not call
Yes, yes
I say they must have a list like that, because I'm a client, and yes
Right
If a client tells them not to call anymore the must be real stupid to keep doing it because the client could get irritated and go
Right
and that way i will try see if they don't call me again those heavy guys from the bank because, they always want to sell me the same thing and i already told them no
um right
hey think one day i will say yes, or what, i don't get it
um
Hello
Hello
yes
is Tammy
Alex
Alex is back, how are you?
good
I don't think many people are doing this survey
I do not think there are many people, no
Because I have spoken to you three or four times.
Well we will pay.
and another person, two or three, no, I think if we talk about after you say, I think if
yes
eh, no, it's not your fault that they don't have enough people to do this survey
yes, I like it
laugh
I'm always up at this time
And today I almost do it early and could not, so I say I'll call later and I forget, and suddenly,
I always call at nine o'clock. And it's nine o'clock.
yes
Well what do you think of telemarketing
I still think the same thing, some I like some I don't, like so here all the time, all the time they come in the mail, yesterday three came.
again over refinancing my home I say so, those people don't leave you alone.
sometimes there is good deals.
yes
I like the marketing in the mail because it's not so, how do you say? it's more private and you can look over the offer without the pressure of the
of the call
yes that is, is the truth too much the truth
And sometimes good offers come, I don't throw away everything I get
mmhm, I always check them
I, I, I see the things sometimes
yes because, mm good there's some how do you say you can find something good yes see but over the phone I don't like that
Good, everything in life is a risk, not me, I think that there aren't many things that are a risk, everything is a risk, sometimes you win sometimes you lose, right
yes
The problem is when they bother you at an inopportune time or when they take advantage of a person
and sometimes they call me very early, supposedly they can't call you until after eight, they call me before eight but I don't answer
yes for me really I don't care because I don't usually answer the calls
yes I notice
yes I know what telemarketing is
Yes I notice the caller ID depending, if I don't know who it is I wake until the recording takes it, if I recognize the voice then I take it
yes
sometimes yes, sometimes if a get the phone and i say ah, i already know who it is and say, no thanks, no thanks. Oh, sometimes a pretend that i don't speak English
so that they leave me alone i don't speak English, that
And they, call speak you in English or Spanish.
in English
Never in Spanish
No, they never called in Spanish only English
and then why here, and here there lots of Spanish people in Angeles sometime they call in Spanish.
yes around here no, they didn't start like that already, good. That is what i have to say.
then i think you are the only person that talks Spanish in Seattle
no we have plenty around
According to Fisher's survey
has something to do because around here there are plenty, the thing is plenty of Mexicans around
yes
you don't have many, you have Panama people but i don't know to much of them and
but they don't do Spanish marketing
no no, they didn't call me or others, from what i know i didn't get any others maybe.
and the other annoying thing, sometimes you have lots of spam in the marketing computer
indeed yes
there are lots of, it should be more controlled by the law.
I got into my, in my email and have ninety seven.
sometimes I have a special email to filter
aha
and sometimes I have a thousand emails of pure telemarking
yes is true
and I have to throw them out,I have to take ten or fifteen minutes to throw them out.When I could be doing something more important
too much, the send you too much of everything, things that you have not asked for. Yesterday, my husband was laughing about a mail he received, about nudist beaches, and I did was laughing
yes wow
very mad, he said. Where, where are they from? and I was laughing.
That is incredible.
it made me laughed because he had all the letters in the hand, but that one, if you see the envelope, I don´t know, it does not say what it is.
he had it in the jacket because he didn´t want anybody to see it. I said who is going to see it, who is going to look in your things. I was laughing.
you, Why do you always send me that? I say, I don´t know, I don´t know.
But sometimes you get good things, about a year ago I received something to go to a show near here
aha
and I won some tickets to Las Vegas and tickets to Disneyland
ah
and I did not spend anything
That is good. aha
there, there are times when you get good things from the telemarketing
But we have to be careful when we get involved
yes we have to be careful, specially with the computer and the credit cards, because most of the time is a trap.
mm
I have a friend that was cheated with a credit card marketing
aha
and they took money from the bank, from his account, because he didn't think and gave his account number
Ay mm
and they charge him about two hundred dollars just to apply for the card
I remember, when I went to see my lawyer, the girl that works in the office, the secretary, was crying, and I said. Why are you crying? She told me, no that
one, this telemarketing people took five hundred dollar from my account.
yes, because
First it was one hundred fifty, the other and was fighting, so the lawyer she was working for was going o help her.
that happens very frequently, that never should happen, never give your tel, financial information to a telemarketing party.
No,people don't think about that.
because they are going to rob you, is a legal robbery.
I, when I buy buy things online, my husband and I have a special bank account in which we deposit only the money we are going to use online.
so, if we are going to spend sixty dollars, that's what I deposit and I use the card and that's it.
and do you know other thing that have happened to me a lot
what
I have received letters from, foreign institutions that want to send money to the United States
exactly, me also
and and they want the bank account to make the transaction.  And I believe that is a trick where you are no goint to get anything, they are going to clean all the money that you have in the bank.
I heard about that in the news, that a few government individuals had been catched, in a city in Africa.
yes, shows in Africa.
were, mmmm
And from Great Britain also, and one time I found out about a company that it was giving me an offer because they want to pay me lots of money.
ahh
and at the end it was a fake company, it was not true.
yes, same to me
ready to clean my bank account.
yes we that people, i don't believe of my bank acount, no, no, no, no, I got calls even from Canada, stating to buy
lotterry tickets
mhm
in Canada, I said, for what? If I didn't buy lottery tickets.  Here, I get them here and there why I am going to buy lotteries tickets from Canada.
yes
no, why no, yes, you will be rich, no, no thank you.
yes, they always say that
yes, a, a card was sent to my son's fiance that said that she won a pair of earings
diamond and a wacth, money and she has to send them around two hundred and fifty dollars in order to receive her prize
yes
and she says to me, because she only is eighteen years old, I tell her, don´t go crazy to not be sent anything.
and, and also it has happened to me that I won things on the computer
yes
but I have to do a poll, and en the poll I have to buy something.
yes
and, I already know that it is a trick, because you give your name, your address, and your phone number.
yes
and afterward they want more, they want you to buy something.
sure, yes
Then I never do it and I have never received anything.  I never have receive anything, to me it is like marketing.
yes,
There should be laws against that trickery.
Yes, because any person, there are persons that are such a sort, that it is easy for them to put things there, when they say there is something free, I tell you, when it is free.
Free, or, or that you have won something.
Yes, my husband always tells me that when there is something like that, read everything, the, the fine print at the bottom, read it well, well because it can take you in with something, from which you have to pay something
Well, it is tough after you sign, to get yourself out of something.
I think that is called a hook in Spanish.
That´s why that they have to, I always tell this to my sister and my kids.
And there is, there is leny of that in Spanish too.
read everything yes I have not received anything in Spanish, yet
You will get in the next few days.
I say with me people don't even think that I am Latin when they see me so I also pretend. so the ones that are on that dis- that now that you have dis- that the, the
that you can also call to have your phone removed that they remove you from marketing that also is good
yes that is good
But I don't know, I don't know, I probably can ask my husband what he knows, because he says that is is free, you put in your phone number, and your name and they removed you from
from the list that they have because there are some that you tell them and they continue calling
I think that they are going to continue calling because they say that they make spontaneous calls, so they are not, but since they know your name as well if they are doing it spontaneously
because
how are they going to know your name
because they buy the names, the list with names
hmm
and sometimes they go, like one time they told me that they go like that with every number, from one two three four fice, they don't they don't know my phone number but
they go exactly, almost, one two three four five, they dial the numbers directly like that
yes
so that is is easy for them to not loose any of them because they are doing in in order
So I think that we agree, the best marketing is by mail
hmm
or newspapers
Good evening.  Milred, of Connecticut.
Ah, good evening, speaks Mercedes, of Philadelphia.
How are you?
Very pleased.  Well.  Let's see, we have to talk about politics.
Aha.
What do we think?  This, for me, is a little difficult theme, because I have not been much, well, yes, I have about six years living here, but never, as I cannot vote, never have I been interested enough for, that is the politics of
And why aren't you able to vote, because you are not registered, or because you do not want?
Because I am still not a citizen.
Oh, okay.
I am only, ah, a resident.  Then, I still cannot vote, and for e-
But the residents do not vote.  I thought that s-
No, no, they do not vote.  We do not vote.  One has to be, eh, a citizen to vote.  Do you vote?  Have you ever voted?
yes, I always vote.
Ah.
I had a time I thought, as well, as I said, ay, I will not vote.  For what?  But, ah, I later involved myself in working with, with one of the parties.  Then I realized that, we need to vote, especially the Hispanics
For you to listen to our voice and our vote there, that counts.
yes, and whad do you think of the Democrats or the Republicans and the differences between them?
Good, well, look, I, I vote for my party.  But sometimes when I like a candidate from another party, I vote for him too.
Mhm.
I am not, how do you say it? I am not, I am not, I am not so fanatical that, that, in truth, that I don't know, since, what they say, since, pure, will I be pure idealistic for that party? But
when I see that a candidate is going to do something good for my community or for the state, then, I do vote for him, even though he might be from another one.
I, vote for the other candidates that, that my party has.  But, no, that is, it doesn't me, I don't try to What is that called?
Just with the line of the pol- of the party.
aha, aha.
Ah, I see, I see, I see. Ahm, and about the, let's say, of what the people sa- well, what the people, the, ehm, the conception that the, eh, democrats are more liberals, and that the republicans are a little more
conservative.  What do you think of?  Conservatives.  What do you think of that?
yes, I think that they are a little more, more conservative in some aspects. But, in some other things, then, sometimes like they get out of hand.
yes.
Yeah.  That is why, I think that it is that they do not, do not keep themselves much in, in power, because they let themselves get, like, like they get scared of it.  After they get into things, like they,
they get scared, and start going backwards, or they stay
yes, what I think, also, is that, ehm, maybe like, ehm, ahm, ahm, they are not much of, of staying on the, on the way  Right? just that,
they are on one side, then, they are like very ex- not very extremist, but they have to the extremes.  I think that that is why some
But, the fact of being conservative indicates to you that, that you know, they keep to the margin of certain things that they don't want to pass.  Because, they keep in line too much to the,
to the questions of ethics, and the questions of, of, of policy, you know.  They follow too much, I think, that, the concepts, The democrats, then, what they see that is going to
still, still that the people gets on top of them, since, they immediately, go, you know, they do it.  Even though everybody gets on top of them to say no, that they do not want what they are
putting.  But, in reality, well, I don't know.  In my, in my country, at least, the democrats, ehm, have, had the control for, like for twenty-eight years.
Hmm.
And, after those twenty-eight years that the leader died, that was the strong leader of that party, then, at that time, it has been, you know, some years they vote democrat,
others, the next other four years they vote republican, and the democrats return again, and they again put the republicans, depending.  Like they depend on, on, on how they see the situation of the country.  If they see that the country did not do anything in those four years, well, they remove the person fast.
It is like that here, it is like that, and it is like that here as well.  But, sometimes, that, ehm, it is, it is like that in my country, I say as well.  But, sometimes it is not so much, ehm, ehm, s- I would like that they realize they maybe it is an issue of the person, not so much of the party.
yes, yes
Right?, or another thing, i don't know, because also it is the other side
Yes, i think if a political party has a good candidate like the man who governed in Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marin
He governed for twenty-eight years. He made a lot of good things, you know, he bring a lot of progress to the country, because The country was very backward, and he throw it forward
Mhm
Well, he maintained the control of all the people. After he died many generations even follow him
Though he was dead, they were following his idealism. They didn't look what they were doing, just did it.
Democrat popular party, it was, its, its, how do you say?, leader. But it was not truth because they didn't see that he was doing something good.
Mhm
I think it shouldn't be like that, Do you understand?. I think if a candidate who can be better, we have to give him a chance.
But sometimes, mmm, i should say it also, the people are with the party, right?
Eh, and it doesn't-
Very fanatical
Yes, I mean, maybe the candidate has no charity, right?. But because the party votes for them at the same time
Some people don't consider the qualifications or the capacity of the candidate, just his charming as a person.
yes, yes
That happens very often in my country, the people fall in love, as they say
Yes, for a face, for a face and for a
Oh, yes. Because of the impression that they gave them, or maybe not
because some gestures. But,
Their resume, or curriculum, Right? It's what they can or cannot do
Well, but, uh, most of the time, all politics make promises, I'll do this, I'll do that, and that, and that, and when they win, they forget what they had to do
or maybe they don't forget, maybe they find a lot, a lot of opposition. Because, especially when a democrat party wins the election,
and most of the house of representatives is dominated by republicans, well, then the task becomes a lot harder. Because, not all them are going to approve the laws he proposes, or the things he decides to do. You know what I mean?
Hmm
And, since they are the majority, and the ones that will vote and counter the decision, then, most of the time, I think it will be difficult
for a leader that a good leader, but the rest of his party doesn't win, then it will be difficult, you know, the, uhm, uhm,
doing everything we wants to do for his community
Hmm
Because the others won't give him a chance
Hmm
I think it depends on, you know, let's suppose, if the democrat candidate wins, and they're almost all democrats
yes
but when a democrat wins, and the rest are republicans, they'll make his life difficult
That's something I think is counterproductive. Right? Because I would think that everything is, I would wish, an ideal world where once they reach power, everyone would work for everyone's benefit
but, there are some that work for their own benefit, not really for the community's benefit
Exactly, exactly. And that's why, let's say, here, the law making process is divided. Right? first the congress, then the senate and then the president, right?
But, usually, a bunch of laws come from the President's initiative, right? But they have to go through the senate, and if the senate is
of the opposite part- most of the senate is of the opposite party, it's a big problem. I mean, it's good, I think that's good because
there is some level of control, right? Uhmm, equality between the two parties. But at the same time, it slows down, uh, things, and maybe creates more bureaucracy, I mean
right, right, yes, it's more bureaucratic, I-
yes
of what is put. Hence, the fights and the problems start, and
And, other thing that also, one, that I have read that they do here in the United States, is, for instance, like, a lot of laws, it is an initiative of the president right?
But, usually they do them like a group, right? of, eh of initiatives in one document, for example.  Right? Because, like, the, they present them at once,
to the, to the, to the senate.  For example, one day, and they place like addenda, or additions right? to the law, that this other law, this other law, maybe people don't support those others, but they do support the main one.
But, like these others where added on to that one, they don't pass it.  Then, they say, no.  No, we are not going to pass it because, because of that right?  And maybe, the principal idea was that they didn't agree, but, now
they have to start again.
yeah.  Because of that, I tell you that when, whey they are not from the same party, they always bring lots of problems.  Then, some want one thing and others want another.
Mmh.
Yes, no, you never know what it is that they are going to, really, to me, I, in politics, well, I tell you, like, I got involve about
after I got here, about, about four years ago, I started to participate, to take more action in the, because I see what, they didn't want to approve many things for Hispanics, and
that they weren't treating very well.  So, I got involve din the, in politics to help.  But, there is also lots of back and forth, and they take you out, they look even under the skin that you have, to get it all out, you know.
Mmh, mmh.
Everything they can look for to find, if you run for, for some position, forget it, they investigate your family, and they get it out that if you sell this, that if you had that, that if your son did this, that if your aunt did that, it was like that.
So, I don't like that, then.  I said, no, I cannot be in this.
Mmh, mmh.
So, I continue working, and I help them, but no, I didn't get involved, you know, to, to run for anything.  I have nothing to be ashamed of, but like I don't like the- the
And, especially, I find that whites, here, they try to, to manipulate a lot and control a lot.
Mmh.
especially in the Republican party.  The Democratic one is a little more, they have a little more of,
yes.
of, of that, for Hispanics, but, Republicans are kind of racist.  They are more for, for themselves.
yes, yes that is it.  A- I that, I agree on that, yes.  That, maybe for the same reason that they are, I don't know,
Hello?
Hi.
Hi. Ehm, I'm Nicole, I talk from, New York
I am, Laia, from, Philadelphia
Hi, how are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine.
Great.
Ehm.
Well, we have to talk about, about politics, don't we?
About politics. We spoke before, didn't we?
What?
I think we spoke before.
Did we?
Yes. Are you from Spain?
Yes, yes, did we spoke? Oh, great. Uh, uh, uh.
Oh, yes. We did spoke before, eh, uhm, eh, you're ah, alumni, at the university there, aren't you?
I'm studying at the university at Pennsylvania, here in Philadelphia.
Right. Yes, I remember. Well, let's talk about politics.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Fine.
what do you think, like, what does a student from another country think about the politics here.
Um, here, well. I'm surprised, that there's only two big parties, that the people, have only two options, because, well, in Spain is really
Um
Actually, a bit chaotic no, because there is
Um
there are many options, then
Yes
Um, you have from more conservative parties, middle, ecologist, more left, then
Um. Um
Me for example, I'm from Barcelona, so, think, there they have more Catalan parties, unless, I don't know, then
Yes
Of options more or less, I mean, more or less big, you have up to six, more or less, and then, if you start counting the small parties, you can have up to twenty
Um. Look.
but those that have, representation in the parliament there normally are, um, six parties, then.
Look, look
However, here, is one, it surprises me, that is like that, white or black.
Sure.
And, and
Sure, Sure and sometimes they are not so different.
yes, that's the problem, also, that's the problem. Because well if there were
Gray and gray. Bad and worse
exactly, exactly, yes, yes sometime they aren't so different, and you can, you can feel a bit not represented, no, almost
yes, um, yes, you have small parties that really have a different perspective compared to others but they don't have,
Um, um,
don't have enough support
Right
Enough money either
Um, um,
em, so you really have tow parties.
Um, um
i mean, when you like, always at the elections, em, when you to vote here, em, they point all the parties including the small ones, em, eh, when you vote but, the other, they're a small percentage
Um, um ...  right
One single time in the, at the presidential elections we had an, like, a man that represented, it represented an independent party
Um, um
is, eh, Ross Perot eh
how, what's his name ?
Perot ? P-E-R-O-T
Oh, okay, yes, yes, that was a man, um
Tha was a few years ago, same he, he won lots, lot of votes, but
yes, um
not enough to win, but
um, um. Um, um, um. um
I don't know, he was a man, very, very rich
yes, no, he was multimillionaire, yes
and of course. Is, he could be a idealist person, or with other thinking, typically it cant.
yes, yes, and well, and even though , I don't know, there had been, in the last one, there was a
It cant
Nader, or Naser, or, or something like that Ra, Ralph, um
Um. Oh, yes, Nader, Nader, yes. Also is
But of course to kick him out is a little, through the vote to the trash, no, because you know that, that really, it will not be liked at all.
of course, of course. Its not a, or rather, is for, is like to say something, symbolic
Um, yes, yes yes
But, not to really vote for him, because not, he is not going to win, we all know that, so hes him
yes, um, um, um, um
eh, he has many ideas, really, really good ideas, in my, in my opinion, but
uh, uh
I would not vote for him just because, I care a lot about who
Of course, of course
Who will be president for real
Of course, the the thing in Spain, is that, he, if you vote, I don't know, well, one party votes, that is very small
Uhm.
but that, after that the, I know as well that it is important, because you know with the alliances that are formed, if none of the parties has absolute majority well really a small party could be very decisive and very important in saying who, who will rule, this, well, has happened many times
Sur.  Uhm.
in history then, that means that, it is not about deciding, oh, since it is a small party then I won't vote for it because it will do no good because it is
if it will really do somethig, but of course in this system over here, it really is a
Sure.
one or another, no?
No, it is always Republicans and Democrats, always.
yes, yes, yes, yes
That means
Uhm
and, since earlier days it has been like that, that is many years ago there were other parties, but
Uhm, uhm. Uhm, uhm
now at least, th last one hundred years
Sure
have been like that
Sure, and it's about time to break this this dynamic, and also
Uhm.
Well, with all the money that is needed, no, to show up, and the campaigns, and
Uh,, yes and what does the people think in, in Spain, or what do you think, about About, about the things that have happened over here, with the elections
So close, and, and, counting the, the, the votes, and the whole mess?
Ah, yes, yes. Well, I, I agree. The first ones that Bush really earned, people were really surprised. At first, the voting system was so complicated and I don't know what and why.
Um. Um Yes.
There was really so much, so much confusion in that!
Um.
The democracy would therefore be bigger, a lot stabler, and I am not sure what else.
Certainly, Certainly, it is like the only one.
But
Because in this country, we send people to other countries to monitor the elections, to see that they are legal.
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
And at the same time, our own election, is very complicated and difficult to understand.
Yes, yes, yes.
And really, at the end of the year, know that choice.
In 2000.
So, that was in the year 2000.
Yes.
This choice, was like a means to an end, it almost paid off, or something.
Yes, it was very strange, truthfully, truthfully.
Because of the connections by bush and the brother of bush, eh, it was.
Um, um.
Florida's governor, like, like everything was a thing of, li-, like it it was
yes, yes
like it was occurring in another place
I see, it surprised me a lot, that Al Gore did not insist more, uhm, did not, did not complain a little more, did not, because everything was so, so strange, so obscure, that
Uhm, yes yes
That I don't know, it surprised me that he retired so to soon, that I don't know, well, I don't know if, I don't know, I don't know, no to understand that
Uhm
Ehm Ehm, wel
yes, yes, I also, I also so it that way, like, how is that, how is that called, ah, I see
Hm yes, and I suppose that things would have gone rather, ehm, different, no, yes
Ehm. Uhm. Uhm.
but, well, ehm, yes.
yes, yes, there was another one, another history, now, that is
yes, yes, yes
I imagini, five years later
Uhm, uhm
all of the things that have happened
And nothing the, and the la- and the last ones too, it was a little s-, well, I don't know, I felt very said because I thought that there would really be a change, no, and that the people
Uhm yes, me too, me too.  The last time really
it would have been
the first time, I felt much, very, very angry, I really like people
Um, um. Um, um.
the majority voted for Gore, and as Bush pushed, they felt angry, and the second time, they felt sad
Um, um. Um, um. Um, um. Um, um. yes, yes, yes.
Because people voted for Bush
yes, yes, yes, yes. The second time is indisputable, that is, um.
as to how they would, as they were going to vote again, after all that had happened.
Um.
I thought, what country is this, that is, those who were voting?
Uh uh, yes, yes.
I don't know, I don't know.
Because you can vote here.
Sure, well I vote, but
You, you or your vote, you're a citizen of America, I mean
yes, yes, yes, yes, I am a citizen. I mean, I was born here.
Of course, um, um. Um, um. Okay, okay, okay.
So, it's not that the system really need to change, I think
Um, um, um.
Because, well the government must also change. But the system for voting is very
Um.
it's very unfair, because they go by state
Um, um. Um.
they shouldn't go that way, they should go, the majority wins.
Of course.
Period.
Of course. yes, yes, yes.
That is, because to go by state, that gives a lot of power to the smaller states
Um. Um, um. Um, um. Of course. of course. yes, yes. At least, a good thing that you have, it's that there are only two terms for President no, or that is that, , at least the next time, well, same is worse than Bush, but, good, I doubt it no?
Um, um.
yes, there, , that this is fine, because in Spain, no, there is no limit
Um.
And I don't know if the, it's perpetuated in power during years, and years, and years
Of course.
And well, also it's fine that there is relief of
Of course. yes. yes, yes, I agree with that, because every eight years, they are eight years, that is they are, it's, ah, it's like enough time
Of course, no, although eight, although eight yes, now, now they have been able to do enough. yes, yes, yes.
We'll see what happens the next time, I don't know.
yes, now do you know who the democratic candidate will be?
No, still no. It's very, it's very early still, because that
yes, yes, yes.
it will happen in the year two thousand
in two thousand, in the eight,
eight, that is, the campaign will start in the two thousand seven already, that is two more years
Uhm, uhm, Uhm, uhm
Uhm, but, until know not, it is not known
But I don't think that Kerry will present himself again, no?
No.
I mean
No, Kerry, really no He was Not a really strong candidate
Uhm, uhm
in reality the Democrats need someone more charismatic, like with more personality
Uhm
with more, with a clearer message for the people
Uhm, uhm, Uhm, uhm
to see that, today, I don't know how it was before, but today, it is needed one needs in politics to have a very clear message for the people, because the people
Of course, I see
it is easily confused, and like it does not does not have much attention, like they don't have as much interest as before
Uhm, uhm.  Uhm, uhm.  Uhm, uhm.
So one needs to have a message like that, simple.
yes, yes.  Sometimes the most superficual remains, a little, no, and it begins to have, well
that of course, and people believe what they hear, but they only believe things that are simple and clear
Uh huh, uh huh.
Like why do people not want to listen to much, much explanation, much of a complicated thing, why does one lose them?
uh huh, uh huh. Uh huh.
Like why do you have to say things in a very direct way and in a way that can be understood, like, like without any doubt.
Yes, yes, yes.
And I believe that Kerry was maybe too smart
Yes, he had a look, sort of pedantic, no, sometimes of a Know-it-all.
Uh huh, uh huh.
And who knows. I saw him a few times when he came here to Philadelphia, to do a pair of meetings.
Uh huh.
And for, for me, his message, I believe he said smart things, but no, that he had just appeared to people, that he hadn't just
Uh huh
about that, to have enough charisma
Yes, yes. And Gore was even worse. That Gore was like so intellectual
Un huh. Yeah.
that people couldn't listen to him
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They didn't hear him, they felt that he was distant, strange, cold.
Uh huh. And also the complete opposite, like, trying to appear like someone more like an uncle, good, "I'm like you", yes.
Of course, Of course, Of course, a neighbor. The man that lives in, in the same block as you
yes, yes, yes, yes that's the role he plays.Which in fact is not, because his family, is a, well, they have a lot of money, and, is a, to start I mean that
Of course.
That he, he is not one of us, let's say, but he is
Of course. And I think that he is also very intelligent
N-
I think he tries to much to appear stupid.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Like to convince people that he is not dangerous.
Mm, mm. Mm, mm.
like, like his is like this.
But is all the opposite, yes. yes, yes.
I think he's intelligent, or if he's not intelligent, at least the people in his government are intelligent.
Mm, mm, Mm, mm.
Because they have done a lot of things, not like that, not by coincidence, in other words
Mm, mm. Mm. mm. Mm, mm.
None of these things have happened without a plan.
Of course, of course.
So.
Mm, and what did you think of Hillary Clinton, as candidate?
Ah, I like her, ah, eh, I like her, but, I think is going to be difficult.
yes?
Hi, my name is Wendy
David, hi. Wendy.

Oh, this is about religion, yeah, that's the way. Uh, I've been talking about the same story for three days, they haven't changed it.
¿About what?
They don't, they don't change the subject.
Oh, i haven't spoken about religion before, only about, uh, it was, uh, possibly politics and
Right
But, i think that it hasn't, ha-, no, we haven't talked about religion before.
Oh, no, not on those days, no. It's like four or five days now that, the topic is the same, about religion.
Oh, yeah, probably yes, yeah, well
Yeah, and
I think it's fine.
Yeah, but man, oh, people get mad.
It's
It's a bad topic man.
Uh, oh, yes
And yeah
for me no.
No No, the people I've talked to, come, one comes from LA
No I believe in God, but I'm not, I'm not a God fanatic, or
right
of religion.
right, yeah
But Yeah well
yeah no
I can see how it could be a very ,uh, controversial topic yes.
Yeah, is very controversial because people get
What?
let me tell you they get really mad, that's another thing, that the
Oh really? To you?
fine fine, and that no,
Why? What
Yes, because
Why? What do you think it is about religion that can make someone so mad?
Well, for, for, for me is that people, I mean everybody believes in their religion, no. But there are different people,
there are different people um, different parts of the world, like the Chinese, and the Muslims the Buddhists, and the Catholics, the
Yes yes
there are different, you know because they don't have the same upbringing.
Oh yea exactly, yes
Then right, so then who, who are we to say that, that one religion is better than another
I am more liberal, in one word, liberal, on my beliefs in God.
Well, but, but, people get angry.  You're attacking, you are attacking their religion, you know.
Yeah
It is uy
Exactly yes
it is a topic to talk about let me tell you
Why is your religion?
Because I am also Catholic, but you know I am, I, I, since I was small I was um, my mom always took me to church.  But sine, since I was eighteen years old, I mean, I got married, and I got married in, in the Catholic church.
Oh yes Oh, true?
and, and, and all, but for me it is you know there are so many problems who had the, the, the hard ones
Hm mm
in the Catholic church, you know I mean
Yes
with so much money, that you pay so much money, that's hard you know, everybody works hard for their money
Exactly
So for, I mean, of course in the, in the, for, for a donation for the church, for the church to help other people, poor people,
and they are helping, one another, they help themselves because all the money that they are giving the families, for them to shut up,
Hm mm
you knot that money you know
Yes
and it was millions, millions of dollars.
E- Oh real- really?
No.
It's a lot of money
yeah, I mean, up here where we live up here, in like I li- I am i live near Massachusetts.
Aha
And, and all the problems were in the, in the Massachusetts church, the Churches in Florida of, of New York, there were many, many um, priests.
That were in, involved with young boys.
Hm mm
And, and, well now, with for thirty years, they raised their- the church already knew of the, of the, oh, priests, that had problems, and if they had a problem,
Hm mm
they paid the family, so that they kept quiet. You know and
Really?
Yeah, and all that money came out from the collection fee. All that money came from the church, and it was millions and millions of dollars.
Wow
Two hundred thousand, a hundred thousand,
how much, how much do they send?
tu sabes
Of, each person, like
It depends, that is
twenty percent, of his income?
uhm, including the, the, the, the, the people that go to church?
Well For example, I think about certain re-religions, it says on the bile that you have to uhm, donate like twenty per cent, I think
No,
of, or, or ten per cent of his income
I am sorry Of his salary, I see But
Like thite, yeah
Yeah, you thite, you do your, your thites, but the, the
Hm mm
If, if they do that.  And, if they investigate. Like it is a - WCW two let me see your, your your, your your, your, your paycheck
Is that true?  Wow
You know, you make Yeah Ifnot, you can not go to church
It is an invasion of his pri-pr-uhm priva, vacy
Yeah, if
Uhm
But it's the same thing.  I know the church that is here, But, t-the, the church when I was, and is large.  And the people that go there
m- they have priests and you know what, that is, because everybody has their name on the envelope, and that is no, you only gave, twenty dollars this week
You have to give them twenty two dollars. No, you win, six hundred and fifty dollars minus the taxes,
Yes
you have to give it to church, to church, you have to give a thirty percent of that, you know and then, they, wait, they expect it
Wow, in the religion
Yes
in the, in the one that I was raised into,
Hm
eh, they don't do that. They um, they ask for donations
Hm mm
for God but it's not for, it's mandatory, yes.
Yes, you have to put, um, um yeah
When I was a kid I was a Lutheran.
Aha
Lutheran, yes.
Aha, Lutheran, I see
Not anymore. Now I consider myself a Christian. I don't go to church. I only go with my parents.
Okay Hm,
In my opinion, going to church, attending mass is really boring. I think that if I believe in something, I have
Ah, yes.
to be faithful to God
Hm
very um, strong, yes.
Of course.
But um no, I don't like going to church.
Hm, OK
Every week.  I don't know how they can do it

well yeah.  Yes, when I was young, when I I went to Catholic school and we went to church every day.
Yes Wow
So but
I think that some Catholic churches, are more un uh well no, they don't tell you to, to go so much, no.  LIke once a week.

More
More, yeah, you know, you went to, to go to church, because you went to pray
Hm mm, exactly.
You know then, one prayed more, and, and it was more for the person than for the church
Hm mm
Then, on these days it's more for the church than the person
Oh, yes.
You know eh, that's the key, you want to go to church so that you could help the church
Exacgly.
you know instead of staying in their business, this and that, that they help him, and that everybody goes backwards, you know but eh, sincerely,
the church is for the, for the youth, or, you know, for the person.
Hm mm
To help them to you know to direct them, in their, in their life you know
Yes
And, and they only want help for themselves, that they, that they receive donations that help them here, they want, um, food, they want time
Hm mm

aha
mhm
oh, you were born here? And who taught you Spanish, your mom?
yes
wow, she did a good job
I, well thanks
that's great, let me see, I believe that Nebraska is in the west of the United States, way up there
yes, we are near at the middle part of the United States
aha, to the North
yes, well yes
hm wait, I have a map here, I'll look for you
aha, we are near the center
okay, eh, Nebraska is the State
yes
okay no, I can see Dakota, Wyoming, it's not around there right, no
Yes, be are below South Dakota
okay, listen we are far
Yes
You are in all of the middle, good
Yes, it's pretty far
Y there is snow there
Yes, but not yet
it still hasn't fallen
but it is very cold
oh here as well, yesterday it was a very nice day
Mm
It was very hot and today it has been raining
Ah
and has been very cold
oh no, here last night it was 29 degrees
oh
at night and today up to 50, nothing more
yes, oh, it is very hot today
yes
or more or less
aha
Listen, your children go to school?
am yes I have one thirteen year old
mhm
and he is in the seven, in Junior High
mhm, mhm
and then I have one in second and two others in kinder
ok, and you teach them Spanish?
ah, my thirteen year old son speaks
aha
but the seven year old ones are not interested at all
ah, what things
and the other boys they have some problems, they were born to early
aha
they were born at six months
yes
then
Are they mellos? Are they twins?
yes
aha
so, they have lots of learning problems, and it was easier for me with the English, that's the language they speak
aha, oh, I see
but I think that there are some
yes
words that they do know, they do know them, they know their meaning but they don't speak
mhm oh, that's good, interesting
they just look at it, they watch Dora
aha, which one?
Dora
Dora, which Dora?
ah, the explorer!
oh, what, mhm
they learn a couple of words there
oh, I see, that's good
yes, I have a girl too
that's good, great, that's good
she is going to be two years old and she still doesn't know which language to use
ah, I see, but it's good that they learn a second language, no
I think so, yes
for example, they will have a lot of advantages when they grow up here and go to college.
Yes yes
and for example it can be like what I do here, I am a TA
mhm
and I came from Colombia to this university to be an assistant professor of Spanish
mhm
and in the same way
mhm
you can do, go to graduate school like graduate studies
oh, yes
o the post grads and they pay for everything, do you understand when they give you a teaching assistanceship?
Yes
and they help you and if you speak Spanish you can teach spanish and in this way you pay for your masters
Ah
and your doctorate and it's very good
Yes then if you speak English really well, it's also true
No, no, I'm barely learning
No
and here my friends laugh at me, but
oh
but well I laugh when they were taught Spanish like that we were by hand
yes, oh, yes
but but it is difficult a little because of the sound and and everything more or less they understand me, they understand me more than before like that yes, when I went home I went in the summer
Oh yes.
I was at home and when I returned nobody understood me in the L airport.
yes oh
spoke with the people and nobody understood me nothing and I uh
yes
but well, another time, ya
yes
they understood me or they get used to me, I don't know but well
mhm and did you understand what they were saying in the mesage right now I didn't understand anything?
no no
last night we spoke of the same thing
yes
I spoke with a woman of the homosexuals
yes
in all twelve minutes because we didn't understand anything the man said
yes that is not good, eh, they spoke, the theme of today was religion
yes
I spoke but they were reading and sometimes I could only speak of other things also
yes, that's what they say
yes
but I don't know, I think that maybe they have to find someone that can speak more or less because
yes, yes because I sent an email to the person in charge and she told me that she's going to look for some native people
aha
so that they speak and say the message
oh
which is very goo, no
yes, the other time there was a I don't remember we had to talk, but I didn't understand anything either
mhm
And my husband is Mexican too
mhm, yes
and yes, and y asked him
oh aha, mhm
