And, and do you think?
Well, I think, well, I'm Catholic.
yes.
And I believe in God very much, but no, I do not practice or go go church every day.
Aha.
Because I was taught from childhood, by the father.
Yes.
we got on our knees and we knelt around the bed
Mhm.
and we were all there, my father, my mother, and my brothers
Yes.
I asked God for dad, for all of us.
Mhm.
And my dad always taught us that to for you to believe in God you don't have to go to church.
Clearly.
Ah, but I have an uncle who is a Christian
Aha. Yes.
but this, it is in Puerto Rico.
Yes.
But, every so often that I go to Puerto RIco, he wants one to change religions, from Catholic to theirs, because they say that the Catholic
yes, yes
is a, ehm, is a religion that, that ehm, how is it?, that you can, that is, that womean ca- can go to with pants, with earrings, that they cut their hair,
Hmm
that they use makeup
Oh.
The, he says that that is not good.
Hmm, yes
That, that, ehm, in, ah, that Catholics are very liberal, not like Christians that they wear their, their
yes
I mean, that women put on their dresses, of their skirt and blouses,
Aha
and long skirt, and, and, no haircuts, and no earrings, and no makeup
yes, yes
Then, uhm, but my uncle is in the religion
yes
And, and he doesn't believe, that, that
yes Hmm
that the same God that the same God that he is worshipping is the same one that we are worshipping as well.
Hmm, yes, yes.  Let me tell you something,
Aha.
There in Barranquilla, in Colombia, that's where I'm from.
Aha.
There is the same problem too.
Aha
But, what results, um, at home, us at the church we attend
Aha
eh, well, we spoke and everything, and we reached a conclusion.
Aha
in that aspect, the women are pretty. No? And, they have to dress up, because they aren't going around like that all of the time.
Aha, Aha. Natural. Aha, aha, aha, aha.
Exactly. There for, in that sense,
Aha
if there , there are people who get really bothered. So, they see the other as being less than everyone else.
Aha, aha, aha, aha.
And, they look at you really strangely. But, I don't pay any attention, because, and more my my sisters, I have two sisters.
Aha
they dress up really pretty, they are young, and you have to get really pretty.
Aha. Aha. Aha.
So then no, yes, but there are people who get really bothered.
Yeah, yeah,
sometimes they do not greet you,
Mhm
or, but no, but yes. They have their way of thinking, and are sometimes, like very stubborn
yeah
really, because, is not like that, is like I say
Mhm
but well. You must
But, also in school, in the catholic church, also. I remember when my children were small
yes.
for, I took them to church
yeah
and we were waiting to see the, come out first, the first turn was for, for the Americans
yeah
we were waiting. And behind me, there was a Hispanic woman,
Mhm
that was talking about the lady that was getting out, that if she thought she was going to a party, that her outfit was very
very colorful to go to church, that her shoes were to high, that she looked too dressed, that she looked like
yes.
that she was going to a party, that she did not looked like she was at a church.
yeah yeah
and i looked at her and said
yes
how is she talking that, if she loves god?
of course, and we had to be pretty because, yeah, one fixes and does good to go to a party, its right, that
ha ha
it has nothing to do with god, and non of that, oh, when one goes to church. one has to go dressed good.
ha ha ha ha ha
looking good.
but its not as much as, to be talking to the neighbor, if you go to a church.
exactly, exactly
i suppose you don't talk about your neighbor.
exactly yea
but, she um, i looked at her, and said wow, my god, is she talking that way, how would it be
yeah
if you see a woman on the streets, showing most of her body
yeah
oh
what things, and
ha
i was gonna ask you, you were born in Puerto Rico ?
yes, i was born in Puerto Rico, and raised there too.
Mhm
and i came here in the United States when i was 18-19 years old, aha

And i got married
AHa, yo got married here

yes
and she will make 50 years, in November
Oh yeah ?
yes, And ah, and i will have 27 years
Oh. Same as my son's age
in November too, yeas, then, that are the things a person starts thinking when he comes, for example, in the United States
Aha, aha
how, trying to find, a better future, for, for it's children, no ?
Aha, aha, yes, yes
So, in that we are walking here. I am
Mhm
working as a professor, an auxiliary professor of Spanish
Uh-huh
But also seeing what possibilities there are to go to school, to do a masters
Oh, that's good that's good
Yes, o try to look for. Because, well, in the house also one can live and everything, but
uh-huh
well, if I can take advantage of things here, it's not bad
Uh-huh. But no, in other countries it's not the same as here
Mhm
There there is a lot of poverty and there is no work
Yes, Mrs.
And here no, here you obtain work wherever you want
Mhm
But, but the family, when, like my family stayed there is Puerto Rico, my mother is there, and my brothers
Mhm, yes.
And my nieces. Y sometimes I go to see them
Yes
But, but I am not going to live there in Puerto Rico because I have my two children here.
Ah. Yes.
Although they are adults now, but they still live with me.
Yes. Yes.
Until they don't get married, and each of them gets their profession, and they leave with their wife and husbands.
Mhm.
eh, no, not possible, I can't go there to Puerto Rico, calm down.
Ah. How great, so are your brothers in Puerto Rico?
In Puerto Rico, yes, yes.
Ah. And how did you come here first?
Ah?
Did you just come to look around?
No, I came here to stay, I went to Florida with my mom and my younger brothers.
Right.
And from Florida, I went here to Chicago with my mom and my younger brothers too.
Yes.
After that, my mom went to Puerto Rico.
Mhm.
and my younger brothers went to Puerto Rico. Therefore, I stayed here, and since I got married, I stayed here.
Yes. Right.
But my mom was coming and going. But, my mom didn't like it here because of the cold weather.
yes, uhm yes, I have heard that it is very cold in Chicago.
Because no, and she says that, that, that what is the use of being here caught inside four walls, and in Puerto Rico she can be coming and going from her house.
yes.
It is not the same
Of course.  Ah, how b- And so your mom is in Puerto Rico now?
In Puerto Rico, aha, aha, aha
Ah, how great
But, my mom is Catholic, and my aunt is Catholic,
yes
and, and, and, uhm but how, uhm, my uncle is Christian, he goes and reads the bible to my mom, and, and, and,
yes Aha
and he talks to her much about God, and as- her ask my mom questions about God, and my mom answers him
yes Hmm
but he does not like it because my mom, uhm, after my grandpa died, my mom tweezed her, her eyebrows, my mom her
Mm
she had done, uhm, wholes in her ear to wear earrings
Hmm
shaved her legs, she would wear pants, she would wear dresses
yes
And, my grand- and my da- my uncle did not like it
Mm. Oh.
Because he says that the women should not wear pants
Yes
In his religion, in his religion
It is, he is the brother of his
mother
mother? Really?
He says that the women should not wear pants because pants are made for men
Mm. Yes yes
But, my uncle, is very very very, how is he, enthusiastic about religion
Yes
He has a religion, devoutly, like, he
Yes
That yes, he doesn't say to his sons that they are religious
Mhm
It's only, to my mom, my sisters, my nieces, my nephews. But, to the sons he doesn't say anything
Ah. Mm. Mhm
So, for that, I say to him that, that he, in order to believe in God, he does not have to spend 6 days out of the week in the church
Clearly, yes ma'am
But, he spends 7 days a week in the church
yes
He is, on, on Saturday, he says that he is going to church since very early in the morning
hmm
until the evening, and on Sunday all of the whole day in church
Wow
So, he is very fanatic with the church
yes, yes ma'am
I have a friend, that she is Christian, and she only, she says that she goes to church
Hmm, yes
Saturday and Sunday
Of course
But, my uncle is on the seven days of the week
Oh, yes
And, he is always talking about God, that God over here, that God over there
Hmm
And, I always him, when I go to Puerto Rico, I tell him,
Hmm mm
G- God, we always have Him next to us the twenty-four hours of the day
Of courses
Y- y- I tell him, you don't have to go to church to talk go God, because right in your same bed, you can speak to God.
yes, miss.
The only thing is that one can't ask father God only. how is it? believing about father God only when one has problems but all the time.
Eh. It's it's
Because there is some people that
Yes
Oh, God what "cocedeme" this, oh my God, that when they are bue- they don't have any problem.
Mhm.
then they don't remember that father God exists.
Ofcourse.
Hello?
Hello, Milgred of Connecticut
Mercedes speaking, from Philadelphia.
How are you, good evening.
Mm, good evening back at you
Hm
Let's see that we speak about religion then.
Do you believe that it unites, disunites, or?
Hm
Or do you believe that if everyone were of the same religion we would be better, or we would be equal, or it would be
Mm, I believe that, I, I that which I think is that, that the
much better the world?
someone would be of the same religion as everyone we would be of the same religion it's impossible, because I think that always there are going to be, eh, cultural differences.
Uh huh, uh huh
And, that always it's going to make that each person interprets the, that only religion to his own way. What do you think?
Yeah, yes, I think that it's, it's the same, and how it doesn't, we aren't of the same races. So the, each race has its
its doctrine, own, or and, and even though we are Hispanic some of us acquired that in, eh, sometimes they aren't, neither, or that is, sometimes we are some Catholic families, and the others are of the family they are
Adventists or they are um, of the Evangelicals,
Hm mm
or they are of the of the others is, of those of the [taballas], those that sell, uh oh what are they called, the l- I forgot the name
Bet, There are many, many races, and many religions
Mmm
But, i don't find annoying other religions. I understand any religion if they don't try to force me, do you follow?
Exactly, that they don't try to force you
Yes, not fans
or oppress you, to don't feel forced, yes
yes
Try to talk to yut. I think that's is how it's called. What divides religion is the differences
well, in everything you believe there are always differences
Yeah, religion is like politics
Exactly
and according how you see it , well not everyone will agree, do you understand me?
Yes, that's why you should never discuss religion. That's why I can't believe why they make us discuss religion in this program
Yeah, but is good to discuss about everything, beacuse, if you know, well, I have cousins and aunts in the Evangelic religion
Hmm
And the rest are Catholics
Mmm
and on the other side of my family they are Adventist
Mmm
But when we get together, nobody is talking about religion, and you must be in that way, you must change
And my cousin's husband is evangelical, so he's almost always in church. And she doesn't belong to the church. Y they have a very happy marriage.
And she, she doesn't, she goes o- only when they have special occasions, like mothers when they make a special ceremony for moms, when they have in, in
in what else they celebrate, because they don't celebrate Christmas, but they have o- there, other occasions that
who are they?
the evangelicals.
OK
Aha, yes, the evangelicals. So my cousin's husband I tell you, is and was not evangelical, they got married in that religion, and after they got married, he got into that church and she didn't.
Hm
And she dances, she drinks, and she jumps and he goes with her to work parties and everything, and he's there, and no
I mean, he's not telling people, ah, you have to stop smoking, you have to stop drinking, you have to there's no time in which
they make jokes at parties, very well, she doesn't get in a bad mood or anything, you know, that, that, that nothing of this, that you shouldn't say that, no, very happy.
Yes, that is, it's a person that everything depends who or whom whom, how, how the person takes it. But if they get fanatical, forget about it.
I my house what happened is that
That's it
that, eh, my mom is evangelical.
Aha
And my dad didn't, um go to church really. He never decided.
Aha, well, that's, aha, they're like with my cousin.
And, but all of us went to a Catholic school
Oh really?
Yes, then because n- then we had, of the, always Christians, then, but
Aha.
eh, we had, eh that is, which we learned in school, we didn't reinforce it at home.
Aha.
And now if, I believe that my, of my brothers and sisters, only the majority are catholic still. My little sister, eh eh, I believe that she's envangelical, and I don't, I've decided that I don't have a religion.
That is you don't go to church or anything.
Mm, no.
No
Uh huh No
I go to church, but no, I'm not with, what one calls a very devout woman, always going to church, no.
Hm mm Hm mm, not I, since I, yes, almost left, I came to college, and I left college, I already decided that I wasn't going to return to
to church, no, not me, no, the interesting truth that, eh, to me, organized religion no, no
You don't like
No, no, exac- not that I don't like but no, I don't feel the nece- that is, because I feel that God, I have him in my heart.
Aha
And, therefore I am passing my life by. Eh, but we say it's already later now, my wife is Jewish, and my son is Jewish too, and we are going to raise him Jewish.
Aha
Because if I believe that one needs bel- eh to grow up with a religion.
Or yes, yes, I believe that is a very important foundation, especially for the children.
yes yes, definitely. I
But yeah, you raise them with, at least with, with some, you forget they go and, and they're, i don't know, they, they get kinda wild, kind
Uh um.
it's like they have no feelings. I mean, they don't create a feeling in relation to anything.
Uh um, yeah.
You understand, it's like nothing matters to them.
Yeah, yeah, that's why i, i agree that yeah, yeah, he, it's that they, yeah, well, children do need it. And that's why they say
And, and, and you where from, you say you're christian and that, it's a miracle that, uh, you were accepted in his family, seeing that Jewish are almost always
¿Right?, yeah, they really are
they're, ¿how do you say it?, they're
Yeah, we were lucky.
They try to marry only between themselves, and, to have the same religion.
Yeah, yeah, it's, there's really, there are some of them, of course there are some that are very strict, right?
Right, uh
But no, my husband's family has always been very understanding. Even the other son married a girl, she's also not
jewish, and i think, i imagine that maybe that's why, right, i was the second one, i wasn't
But did you marry by catholic or jewish?
No, we had a religious, a Jewish ceremony
Oh, that's nice, oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, and, let's say, and that's what i say, well, my son will be raised and i say it's important that he's raised with a religion.
Uh um.
When he's an adult, he can decide what he wants to do.
And let them decide, right.
Right, if he wants to keep, or, if he wants, i don't know, stop being, be something else, whatever, but i do think that, whatever religion, a child has to be raised with a very definite religion.
The, my youngest daughter, the older are, they were baptized and they're catholic, but the little one, despite being baptized in the catholic school, she also visits the church
The evangelic church
Uh, um
She goes with my cousin's husband, and you know, when she goes, she wears her long skirt, you know, like she respects their, their
their religion, and she, she likes to go with them, and i never said no to her. When she asked me "can we take her", i was like "oh, yes".
You know
I don't understand that, because let's say, my mom, uh, that she says that when she, when she goes to church, she has to wear a skirt.
Then, i tell her, ¿but what's wrong with wearing pants?
And, because, uh, uh, i think that the bible establishes that, that the, that the man wears pants, something like that, uh.
Yes, but, to me, that, and that, to me was one of the, um
it's related to that
reasons, ¿right?, that, uh, not keeping away from, but since, a little from organized religion, any organized religion. That there's people that's too strict about the bible, well, they take it
Um, those are the ones who become fanatics, that
Uh, yes.
They interpret word for word, to what's written, you understand.
Um, um.
It's like the, these, the Iraqi ones with their doctrine, that madness, that they kill people, in the name of, of
from that God they have, or from other, or in what they believe
Hmmm
Then sometimes you have people with brains, somehow distorted
Hmm
interpreting something that must truly unite. Because the religion must unite, doesn't matter it's kind. You got it. I don't think that because a persona and religion and other, then
they must kill each other. For that, for the other, for that belief
yes
Then for me, like I'm neutral to all that, i, i don't get fanatic with none. I notice that i was raise in the catholic religion,
and was helping in the church, i was part of Daughters of Maria Club, and i was helping allot. That is
and was my belief, the catholic and not only, eh, i took my children to the church too, and baptized them because that way i was raise too
They are grownup people, and they can go wherever they want to, i will understand, i will not tell them that they cant visit other churches too
oh, you can't believe in that, because catholic say they're different. You know
Hmmm
Majority of the people are, of them, are in gospel or Jehovah's Witnesses nad they want to force you believe, they come to your home in the morning and try to sell their stuff
Yes indeed, sometime they come and i tell them thanks, i have the small book, or else look I'm catholic
Ay, but there are people, good, i understand them
They are unwise
is their job, but they want people to convert into their religion, true. But they don't respect either
Aha,
True, or maybe not, there are some
I had a lady that came and, every time I crossed my door, the woman arrived, and started look, do you want to help us, buy this little book, do you know that
you're sinning, and whatever, but the thing is I've been a sinner since my daughter was born. So the Lord will reprimand me when I arrive up there, well
Eh, yes, they try, I don't know, they try to tell you such negative things, instead of telling you, look, you can know more about the Lord, and I don't know, from
from other points of view, but that you're a sinner thing, yes, yes, I keep sinning and right now you're sinning by talking like that
Hello
Good Evening How are you doing? With Norma from Atlanta, Georgia, and where are you from?
I am Arthur, I am good, I am in Pensylvania, Philadelphia
ah, OK
Nice to meet you. Where are you from Norma?
I am from Peru
Peruvian, mine, mine, mine roomate is Peruvian
ah OK there are many Peruvian here
from Lima, many Mexicans also
ah Are you from Mexico
yes, I am from Mexico
Ah OK
Mexico City
mhm
very well, and in Georgia Do you work or study?
no, I stay home taking care of my kids
ah, ok, very well and your husband, is is from
Peruvian, no, no, my husband is
ahh, from Peru or American
mi husband is American, yes
ah okay, ah very well
so then, what do you think about religions?
so, then, I believe that since the medieval times or so
yes
religion was lost during institucinalization, well, what a I mean with that is that religion ceased to be something spiritual
mhm
and turned into something more political and then lately it has ceased to be so political, although it keeps carrying much of it
mhm
like institutions, so you can be very religious and spiritual
mhm
but not neccesarily institutionalist so maybe you do not need to agree what the church says o agree what
some institution like the Jewish or Catholic or Islamic says but then may be you can, as I said with other matters, mix a little of the philosofy of all of them and
use them somehow to take a good way of life more than anything
mhm
what do you think?
Well I am a very religious person and am a believer for the Hare Krishna religion, not sure if you heard about that
Ah yes, yes, I never heard them, I do not know how they are very well, what is Haré Krishna about
mhm, yes, it is based on Hindu philosophy
aham
So one, we believe that one is a part or portion of God and we also believe in reincarnation, we have rules and regulations, we are vegetarians, we do not eat meat, eggs or fish
mm, we don't drink alcoholic beverages
And why not, why don't you eat meat, why do you think that?
because we believe that that every living body deserves respect, and no, to avoid violence against other living beings
ah okay
that's why we don't eat meat, we don't intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol
aha
we don't drink coffee or tea
yes
and we don't play lasso games
no game to lasso
no and are you religious? do you take part in any religion?
and no no I don't belong to any institution for the moment I was born and raised catholic and but right now much bigger right now I have twenty one years
like eighteen years and after I didn't follow the institution because well it didn't interst me much what they practiced and
and more I thought that before my spirituality, my contact with
mhm
with this God well no, it didn't need to be across this institution then I dedicated myself to read about other religions a little but more than anything to
to cultivate myself and to practice a good way of life but
mhm
I don't like any, I don't like the institutions
but you do believe in God
Yeah, definitely, but no
Oh, that's very good, i mean, many times you can't identify with a group of people, a group of, right?
Exactly
But the important thing is for one to have God, ¿right?, in your heart, and you try to like develop your relation with God, that's very important.
Yeah, yeah, precisely, acknowledge that there really is
Um, a supreme being
A divinity behind everything, ¿right?
Sure
But, yeah, i mean, well, based on that I've changed a lot, and in fact i study chemical engineering and many times people think that sciences tend to, uh,
let's say, break people's religion, corrupt it
Um, yes
But i think the opposite, because people who starts to know this, well, they're very scientific, and stuff like that is normally very religious because
because the more they know, the more they learn and they can explain
Um
the more questions arrive, and, and the more the world discovers this is unexplainable, and there are miraculous things all the time and everywhere, and
i feel that every time, the more people know how those scientists and those people understands more that, there must be a divine chaos, a, a divinity behind everything
Of course, a supreme being that controls everything that happens.
Yes
Right, and religion really, i mean, religion or your beliefs about a supreme being, uh, right?, they unite people, because when there's a disaster or when there's suffering, you always
Right?, you turn around and you always ask god to please help you, every body, there are many people that even call themselves atheists, and when they're desperate, they always
They don't ask, they ask god for his help
yea yeah yeah, yes to that
no that is actually when somebody has it in their heart, one knows when their is somebody supreme above themselves.
yes that's right, you just don't ask for help in a religion, but you thank it.
mhm that's right mhm
I think that people start being religious in certain moments, because they need help, but once they're ok, they're over it.
yeah yeah, that's right, in the philosophy that we have, there is always a verse that says, when somebody is suffering,
Yes
One always, one always asks god for help, but people says that you also get to suffer so that you can remember about him more often.
Because when somebody is ok, one forgets about gods relationship.
Yes
um, that's true right. because when somebody is doing good, they're happy.
yeah nobody remembers it
No because, one already thinks one controls someone, but not that you're the one that controls everything that happens. right.
Yes,yes,yes
No but really, its when god blesses you and helps you in many circumstances.
yes,yes.yes of course
and, do you have a believe according to the reincarnation or something like that? have you heard about karma?
Well, I've heard about karma, and how karma is like, like if you had bad karma you would reincarnate in a different person.
mhm
To make it better, not to clean it, not to have another opportunity than, to make your karma better, purer, isn't something so
Yeah, yeah, one of the laws of Karma is a law of action and reaction that you follow then, positive or negative activities don't have either a negative or positive reaction.
Ah, okay
Beacause of this it's often said, but why so many things happen to people, sometimes you see good people but they really are
reactions to past lives where one did a lot of negative actions and now it's a negative reaction that they're suffering.
Yes
It's not that really you don't have very innocent people, or people who are really good that it's only the reaction like one has free will
not to do what you want, God doesn't demand that we believe in him, or that we serve him, or to go to his devotional service, because of this
yes
One doesn't use his free will, and does negative things and many times this is a reaction to the law of Karma, for this law of Karma, of that no one is free of the law of Karma, it's unbreakable
Yes,
Mm, this is what we think, or what we believe
Oh yeah, I see the Hare Krishnas.
In our religion, yes
And, and, and what do you do?  You meet with the Hare Krishnas every week or daily?
Yes, since now I'm married and I live here in the apartment close to the temple where we have
Yeah
The temple here in Georgia, in Atlanta, but before I lived in the temple and I was interning there, I made service not to Krishna, but to God
Ah, yes
No, there are different types of services that one can do, one prays, one sings the holy names of the lord, one cooks for the lord to give offerings to God
and you do different activities, no
aha
not all, or rather one realizes that your, the center of  your life is God no, and one offers him everything that he makes, all his work, the whole kitchen, everything he makes, and in the moment that he wakes up, one goes to the alter and reads
and we offer food to the gentleman then it is well now I am married and have kids and I have to worry about them
certainly
now but I always go to the temple no and always have the devout there and we reunite the majority of the Sundays or for big celebrations that we have during year.
mhm
ah okay. Do you guys have a prophet or something that is like Jesus Christ, how is it?
well, we have Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada Ace Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, it is God's devout one that brought this knowledge here to the Occident
aha
no y and he is the one that we eh in reality no, o-honor and
What is its name?
well, we respect Jesus Christ a lot also, it's not like we do not respect other religions, other beliefs
of course
of course and, but he brought acknowledgment here to the Occident close to Krishna's conscious like ourselves we, we call it by the name of the city.
ah okay
mhm
What is the gentleman's name?
mhm
What is his name?
It's called international society for the conscience of Krishna
Oa, okay, okay, but, how it is named the man who brought her?
It's called Ace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
wow, that's hindhi or, where is it from?
Yes, he was born at India
ah okay
well, he's not in this planet, he died, he abandoned his body
ah okay but so, it's possible that he has reincarnated in somebody else, or does he reincarnate because he has karma.
no, I mean, he's devout, he is considered a pure devout of God, so, he has gone back to the spiritual world.
ah okay, so he doesn't reincarnate anymore
no, he doesn't reincarnate because the whole point of this life, this material world is to develop a devotion for God
aha
so, when you go back to the spiritual world, the spiritual world doesn't go back to this material world, we are through the cycle of birth, sickness and death, all living things
yes exactly
no, even animals, human beings
okay sure
no
so, so, he's moved on from this level, he doesn't reincarnate anymore
nn aha
okay
yes, he has passed that level, he's a pure devout now
ah, very interesting
it's really interesting, it would be good for you to get involved if you can
and how long have you been in that religion?
Hello good evening,yes who is calling?
Hello, good evening ah is Jose
Jose how are you,Josefina fine thank you how have you been this Sunday ? fine ?

two days two three days yeah
yes no yes then yes as well do not have classes on Friday
oh my god
then well well i have classes on Friday but no
not mainly
it is not more if it is not in general I do not go because there is more then  a student graduating that helps but seriously the class
ah it is during the week that there is a teacher but only if we need help.
sure and in a week you told me that you had an exam like Friday or something like that
then yes yes on Friday then I was studying and also have yes I have few things this week on friday i also have homework for
a math class that I'am taking and I'am also taking eh i'am taking a marketing market class I also have another one, another homework then
mm a little of each one
ah in a week yes you have a busy week but at least I have
yes, you know
all these two days free yes
we're almost at the end of this program, I think because I see, how many calls do we have already? I think we're close, no?
ah I still don't I I it's that many nights I'm busy and and I can't then
ahh
only I have maybe twelve, thirteen, yes
ahh OK I cancel, I had to do a few days but only like three days and then I'm going on twenty I think or something like that
ahh yes that's the reason why I want to hurry because I now that soon
you chiii
there are people that will stop doing it
this thing will end but there are people that are starting now
ahh
I spoke to someone and they told me this is my first call a boy from Peru
m
by the way he's in the same University of Pennsylvania
ahh
and he studies ah of history, history
ahh, yes almost everyone
that that
knows someone at the university or they study at the university because
It's just like that.
but I just don't know how they would know about that.
yes wait a second they're at the door and I have to talk to them, one moment please
okay yes of course, sure no problem
hello, forgive me, four minutes have gone by
yes, yes, yes no matter
it's that they never come when I want them to come
no but it seems to me that this program has had a few problems with the computers or the, I'm not really sure what kind of devices they use to call
yes, a ha
they record with because sometimes, two times it happened to me that I was in the middle of a conversation and all of a sudden the line goes dead
happened to me like three time or I don't know so I sent them a e-mail to this Shudong, Shudong I don't know what
mhm, mhm yes Shudong yes
and they answered and told that there a few people with that
yes
with this problem, and then after that came another e-mail from them saying that they had warned that there were people participating that didn't speak Spanish very well
yes those
aha and they they were hanging up when
yes Shudong
ahhh
yeah Shudong says just to hang up on them but I feel bad doing that but I don't know
I to me-, just one lady from New York who doesn't speak much Spanish I but I have talked with her twice, I laugh a lot because
ahh
her name is Erdestina, have you talked with her?
mmh, mh
Ernestina and since I am Josefina, we laugh
ah
And I tell her there is Ernestina, Josefina and then
yes
we laugh a bit and she tells me and that about her family
but is she American or?
I don't know because I think that the other day I talked with someone who lives in her house and told me she was from an island there is no
it is not Granada but it was an island from
mmm
from there in the Caribbean that has a special languages and no, something like it is
ah and not necessarily Spanish
yes, but in any case she understand, well yes one
yes yes yes
you explain it well she understands, look and this about e-mail, have you bought? with have you solicited?
no never, never well what I have is that I on my account, because I have two accounts one on hotmail and one on
at the university and at the university they almost never send me
No
This way unpopular mail but in hotmail is terrible, all of them, every day I receive
ah
20, 25 messages and all garbage but
ah that you won this that, that you put like me they arrive by msn, i have MSN
mhm
so Josefina was prize-winning with this, your cousing here has a free scholarship and you have, I don't know
ah
and a trip, and the cruises a
eh yes
and I delete them because those are to know
yes
if one responds to them not for
yes, the sad part is that with but because what the people do is they send all that mail is that they have, they put, ah they create programs
that go across the internet of the site of a website to another website then when they find
mhm
an email address
ah
they put it in a list and then if
I day and how do they verify if so of one, no?
yes, yes then and also go to news group and also go to...
weird people
..all, all, all and then is very easy, then for example the directories, for example I imagine hotmail directory too
search for names and search and then create a huge list
wow
and then with that list create a message right and then send it to everybody in the list but, well then, it doesn't require a lot of work, very little right?
mhm, mhm
and if two, three people among thousands reply then they made enough money for whatever
to cover costs right?
yes, yes it is sad...
o but
with two or three dimwits they annoy everybody else, right?
but that is horrible
mhm
I asked, didn't buy, but they installed it from ~msn right?
mm
I think that it filters a little but not always junk, where it says junk you have ten or twelve a day, right?
always happens, I read an article, very interesting saying what Microsoft wants to do now, creating software which..
...everytime that somebody sends a message to the computer has to..I don't know..has to break a code or perform a task..
..but not very big
aha
but that it requires like that a bit of work right? then if you are only sending e-mail, wrote an e-mail and sent without noticing right?
so
and then when, then when the computer does that task, then it breaks a code exactly it does that then eh Microsoft gives a certificate to the e-mail which the e-mail
that that the person took a little time to do that right? then if you are only sending two e-mails it doesn't matter then the e-mail arrives and you know it is spam but if you are sending millions of e-mails
Mmh
you you don't have, the computer doesn't have the strength like that the processor cannot do so much work right?
aha
to send so many e-mails then it takes longer and possibly what you wait is that it is going to take what I think is going to be too long
slowly and they are not going to be able to send all the e-mails they send nowadays
ah
and the moment you receive an e-mail without that certificate you know that it is spam and you can discard it
or it has to bring like an annex or an attachment or something like that that says
yes yes I don't know exactly
if you want to open this e-mail something like that you said
I don't exactly know what it is but I, I think it is a good idea
aha mine has I say they have done because when I send through Yahoo because I have a mail, a division
mmh
on Yahoo and sometimes when I am going to send an e-mail it asks me ah to identify something that is like deciphered, it has to be deciphered no
mm
he says this to protect
yes
messages something like that
yes, yes
then put the pieces, the letters as you see them
OK
But sometimes say-, it is a.., r, j
Mhm
you and a number and something like that
and the numbers yes
you have seen it that it is not like a crossword puzzle, like a puzzuddle isn't it?
yes I have seen them, yes hmm, hmm
I don't know if that is what the
yes, I don't know, I don't know
to protect
but I think that the filters are not are not very like that efficient because if one thinks that that that no that each time that one puts because one can say oh well he has a
a, an, how is that call when you say suspicious phrases it can be sent to the spam right but many times then
oh yes
the ones that create the spam know which ones are the, the the suspicious phrases so or the phrases that that in general activate the filter right
ohhh
then they create the the the message in a way that it does not
that does not filter
that the filter doesn't catch it, yes yes then
oh and how it is in the, in the forums, you have thought in those forums of of the Univision or Telemundo
ohh if every once in a while
and when you write you a work like stupid or idiot ehm it doesn't it doesn't catch it, no? that is it says we don't allow that type of vocabulary in this
oh how interesting
Hello How`s it going?
Aodri Hello, And how`s it going?
very well, I`m Miguel angel, and I`,m in Philadelphia and you?
Me, my name is Aodri and I`m in New York.
You are in New york?mhm, from where? from Argentina, don't tell me.
No, I`m Peruvian.
ouch, I`m sorry! because like you had the "cho" you know you have the New "chor" so I thought, I said she is from Argentina.
Is not the first person, don't you worry.
oh, good, good.
but tell me.
How you? How you told me you name was?
Odri
Atri?
Aodri
ah, oh,oh Odri, like Odri.
Yes, yes exactly, exactly.
good,good,very good.
good What do you think about the mail? No requested.
I think about the mail no requested, so it is one roll.
yes
that I immediately throw it in the trash
No, yes, I ohm
when it arrives
For me that, when I open my email and I see a bunch of, when I see that it get, oh and say, look at this!, because sometimes it says things like
It gets me mad
Five, nine messages and I have to see who wrote to me and I see there are five new ones and four
yes yes,
go straight to junk
mhm well and for, and the thing with the email is a scandal, the thing with spam
No, but the good thing is that for example, the email service that I use
which one do you use? yahoo?
what do you call it, no, i use gmail, so
oh, Gmail yes, yes
yes, they can and you can designate
mhm
that like them like I don't know how you do it, but they have a formula for for verifying that it is like spam and it, it sends them to another folder
mhm
So ha, I those, works, I'm not going to say that it works so well ninety percent of the time
yes yes I have, yes it's true, I have yahoo and also, and also the spam. It sends it to a different folder and
yes
And if you don't want to read you don't, no, you don't read if you don't want to
yes, mm, I believe
mm yes, no, no that is it is true
I believe that the majority of the the services of the mail technicians have that now because it is like an invasion because and they try in any case to put
words as if it were a conversation, and it is not just in English because I am going to tell you that
Ah, no, no
I also receive a lot in Spanish Eh,
yes, yes, yes
My personal mail and my mail also at work and I get a lot, a lot, a lot
mm, if not I also the Spanish I, look I have been living in Spain aha, until last year, I have been here just a year here you know in the United States
And well in Spain also I mean there is also a lot of spam there I don't know, no, no, the language doesn't matter there, so, this is already international
Bad things get everywhere right away ah,
Then you have never bought anything through spam
Ah, I have bought, I have bought things on the internet I mean I have bought books on Amazon and I have bought concert tickets and all that, but it has always been by my own initiative, you know that
eh, if I want to buy a book, or I want to buy a CD or if I want to buy a concert or movie ticket I mean
but it is simple because I wanted, you know never because they have sent me span and I had opened them and have bought because it is directly I don't read it, you know I delete it
Then no and when I get something on the mail that I haven requested well, I mean I throw it out directly, you know that I don't even see it
And sometimes well man, also it is true that some times I read it no but mh No, generally I never care, and have you bought something?
Not I no, not I but I remember that, it might be a year now, I read a newspaper article about a man who
mmh
Yes and, he loves to buy stuff, silly stuff
mhm
he lives from that and i but, i must say that i never got to know someone that
yes, yes
that bought that spam because to everyone they, they get little anger when they see that holy spam and this, the other and i
Besides big part of those things are, like they sell you, and after that they don't send, they get your money
they send you a low quality product, like they send you those things, they aren't, completely because they sell it, no the we get to see that and other stuff sometimes
I've met people that bought and said this is shit, this is a thing that breaks in two days
it breaks or you know that they aren't quality stuff because if you say
yes
if you said this is good, this is bad, this is like this and that, but all that regarding spam, is all nothing but junk
yes, it is, bad taste
Is like, is something like yes, the sell of that and all those magazines full of
ridiculous stuff, then you have a thing to scratch you back and that's one, you saw all that and the magazines full of garbage, junk stuff ?
you saw that, stupid things
yes yes, you know one thing
yes, that for example, one
probably there is a reason to have a think like that, and spend the money because eh
And you saw that, those are like small bots that have plug and they warm you legs, you saw that ?
yes, yes
yes.  And things like that, no, that they sell it to you, the lady goes out like that.  Sir with feet in, stuck in the little ball, that
gets hot and it warms up feet and sometimes I want to buy that, my mother
No but you know what I always say, I say someone has to be buying this for them to send it as they send it
Of course
And, and they have put laws in place like that, in the state of Virginia is illegal
mmh
Sending spam, an unsolicited e-mail
yes
But in any case lots arrive, horrors arrive
yes,
It is also like for example the ones who dial the phone, ah ay, that I, that makes me go crazy, when I see
Ah, no, no the ones who call you on the phone, yes, I directly say no to them
yes,
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am not interested, and that is it and I hang up.
No, no, no, no I am not so sweet with them.  No, no, no I tell them no that what do they do with my name, take my name out immediately
So, there is something, I don't know if it is federal but I know that in the state yes, what was done is that our governor and that is it gives you a cover
And that you can, you can place your name and if someone calls you they have to to pay a fine because it says they shouldn't call you
yes, I, I have my boss, my ex boss, what he did when they called him from, one of those cards, to have a drawing on the house, what do I know
Eh, from the mortgage, he said wait a moment and he would leave them waiting, because he said look when I have to talk with customer service for anything, the credit card, the bank, what do I know
they always put me on hold for a long time, so I love telling them
yes
wait, he loves to do that
ok, man, you don't know, it happens to me also, i feel shame for the people who is working on that, don't laugh, because is true
i feel shame for the people who has to work calling, then if I'm not interested, i say i'm not interested and hang up the phone
but i try to be polite because you know the people is working to get a salary, for the telemarketers is not pleasant
that the people offend and insult them, or hang the phone just without any answer, because i was working on that
i don't know, when i was young and i was studying, well, I'm still studying but when i was younger
in the summer, you know, i worked as a telemarketer, and i was not a seller, no, i was not selling
oh
i was receiving calls, i wasn't calling
yes
i was working for a Spain supplier and also an insurance company
yes
about, how do call it here?, road assistance
ah, ok, OK
then the people call me because their car was broken and we send them a breakdown truck to take them to the garage
i was working eight hours a day and there is a moment that you are fed up because everyone is calling to tell you their problems
and insulting you, telling you that the assistance is not there, treating me bad and you have no blame at all, i was the last guy
i was just an employee i didn't have any idea, you know, if the company was good or bad, i was there just because they were paying me
answering calls and give the best service, that's why i feel a little shame for the people who is calling
because those people who calls you do not intend to make the puñeta people calling you do not have to bother intecion people calling you to eat, eat you and me, you know
and want to have a job, then
Yes
I do not know gives me a little sad, or understand that yes, no, no penalty will not for I will buy a product I sell, that, that, that would be the last straw.
but you know, but at least treat him well, and say look it is now I do not care because people know as they say here does not have a lot of attitude here in the U.S.
Yes
is one, is one of the things that I notice, I notice as cultural difference, no, and I call being in Spain, being an "edge"
Yes
do not know that to me, or not, you know sometimes you have to be "edge" because people are you up a little hump sometimes not, but the beard.
when there is no need to be "edge", because there is no because, you know
you're right, not always the case, but no, not gonna lie to say no, I'm always there, no, no Oh I want,
yeah
it is the same thing especially when I call my mobile phone say ah
of course
in middle of the day or sometimes at work, or i don't know, look i have many things to do
yes yes
no what for you are swelling the balls
hey tell Odri What do a peruana with Argentine accent in New York
well, you know its a kind of long story, well first i was born here my parents are from Peru but also my parents were left
ah
well very young from their country then
ah
neither of my parents leave peruanos, even my grandmother has not, my grandfather hadn't either
mmm
oh, my grandfather lived in Argentina for a decade
oh, of course
he was very sticky to take the Argentina culture and everything else
ah for that is

then thanks to them it stick me, but not is stadium legal
Hello?
Hello? Good.
Good. Ah, my name is Jenny and I'm calling from New York.
My name is Anni, and I'm calling from Miami.
Ah okay. Hello.
Hello.
Um can hold just a moment. There is a call on the other line that I need to take immediately.
Okay.
Okay.
Hm mm I'm, I'm coming out
Hello?
Yes, no, it's not important
Sorry ah, What was the subject of this call?
Music
Ah okay. Good, let's start. yes yes, you want to start
Ah. Music, eh? We spent the whole day listening to music. I have a girl of twenty three months.
Oh okay.
And no, I do not let her watch TV, but I have always
Uh, Hmm
Music was playing while she threw a plate on the floor and we are trying to
Oh, okay
Sorry?
No, it's ok, don't worry about it.
Ah.  But, you know, we spend all day listening to music.
Hmmm
Classic, or, you know, playing, or whatever.  We listen to it in English and in Spanish.
Oh, okay
So that when his dad is home, we only speak English.
Hmmm
But when he goes to work, we only speak in Spanish.
Oh ok, ok, I understand.
Yeah, so, and you?
Ah, well, my, uh - normall - I, I, I listen to all kinds of music.
Oh
No, I don't have a favorite, I like to listen to anything.  Even music in another language.
Oh.
Um. And yes, I can spend a whole day listening to music because, like they say, music is calming.
Hmmm, hmm
Even the most ferocious animal uh, uh, uh, um, I think he's calmed too.  I know in the moment when I work from home
Hmmm, hmmm
And working in the court too. So when I'm not in the court discussing something, I'm at home. And, in those moments that you feel more agitated.
hmm mm
Ah, it's the best moment to start the radio. And hear something to calm one and put it back, in the
yes
in the thinking mode that you should be. Um, right now no, I don't have kids but um, it lasted a few years working in a pre care -
Aha
And that was the best, when one wanted to
Hmm mm
a class of eighteen 4 year old kids to calm down
yes
puts a, a music ah, classical
hmm mm, hm mm, we
and how that changes the room's overall mood. Because, if it affects the sense of the human animal, so to speak
Well, we had a
So Hm mm
not a bad time, but my daughter still only two months ago started to sleep during night time, for the whole time
Oh, okay
But when she was seven, for eight years we took her with us in the bed
Hmm mm
the cradle of her. And I could not, it was very difficult to make her sleep, and finally discovered tat If I put some music with a sound machine,
Hm mm, hm mm
you know, that she sleeps well.  And now, eh, we bought her an iPod
Okay
Because, ehm, what I do, is that I have, you know, one month and like one hundred-something - CDs
Hm mm
Then, I, I can choose what I would like her to hear.  Usually when we put her to sleep,
Hm mm
we take you know, what, what, the nursery, the nursery rhymes, I think that's what they are called,
I see
Then, ehm, I ehm, I turn on the music, I turn on the, the, the sound machine
Hm mm
Well, we read her a few books. And already, she already knows that when she hears that, you know, she, she starts to sleep.  She sleeps better. I, ehm- already, I put her to sleep on the crib, and like in that five minutes, she already is
Wow, so you already have her in the routine
sleeping yes, and that, for e- and for that reason was that, on of the reasons that we bought the, the iPod.
Hm mm
Because also when we are in the car, she wants her songs and w- whatever and for one to take, you know, to take five hundred something _CDs have then in the car,
Oh yes, it is better to take the Ipod than
And But, she is also one, one well, is not, she sometimes, ehm, she is a baby model
Hm mm
Then we bought her the iPod with the money that she
oh
she does it herself you know
OK
that she does it the same in work
so more or less, like the vagrancy of her they do
yes, yes
oh well, thas a good idea
we did it, in good part because her and part mine, because i have my music there too, so you know
well how not, its not going to be the music of her only
yes so that
oh, oh that's not thats not the way the things are
well, probably ninety percent is her
oh wow
and you know, because if we are in a place, or wherever because her car too
mmm
it has a headset
yes
and when we buy it i thought who its going to put you know a walkman o something and now i am doing
no that's the better because i tell my point of view of a person that was a teacher
yes, so do i
The music is, parents cultivate the love for music to their kids, is like teach them how to read
Because it helps in concentration, the movements. If you watch a kid when he is listening piano music
they pretend to be playing with their little fingers. All that helps
Hmmm
for the development. I forgot how to say development  in Spanish..
Don't worry, I understood
Oh, development!, The development of the kid  is doing great. I always thought that , i always told my husband: When we will have children
There are some things that you are going to think to be kind of crazy. I said him that i want to
Yes
I want to give birth in a bathroom with water and music, he said that I was kind of crazy
No, but figure out that we are having our next baby
Hm mmm
If God wants, in o week from now
Oh, wow
And you know, that's what we are doing. We are going to a maternity center right here, and that's hat we are going to do
Ohh, Yeah
Because you know, for mi, my first birth experience was a c-section and
Oh...
and it wasn't because I wanted. It was an amergency
Oh, excuse my, shhh, it's my dog...quiet
But, I believe that, okay
I'm sorry
That's okay. So then,
yea
you know, so then, we are going to do that. And with her, she can't see anything of television.
that is the best, yeah.
you know, uh, many times when we go to church, and they are taught, you know the cartoons, Elmo
Hm mm
or whatever, she just looks at me, like what is that, yes people look at me like, how can she not know who is Elmo, and I, well since we do not watch television.
No, that is, is the best method, that can assure the success of your child.  Eh, to keep him/her away from that. That is the problem with my husband.
well, I say, because him, his mother was a little weird because she taught him, let him be in front of the television all the time.
yes
and I don't know, I had a television until I was thirteen years old. My mother and father would not buy a television, we had nothing of that.  Only he finds it weird.
I was always did well in school.  In the school system, I was always in advance. I finished the University early, he has waited for me.  All that I have done, I have done it fast.
and with ease, and he, I don't know, I always tell him because I did not have any distractions. I did not have a television to take away one or two hours.
from school. You know, everything was always, was focused, yes my mother and father, we were poor, but yes, one of us wanted to play music and my father and mother did whatever they could to take music lessons
You know, if we were interested in animal, we would go to the museum
yes
on the weekends, o you know, there was always something of education. So, you grow up, in little time, or rather, when you are, eh, a teenager.
grow, and, and you see the difference, and from your friends, that know this, that know about that
yes.
and you feel weird, but then when he is more more mature now, I see, and I say thank you.  I tell my mom, dad always, thank you very much.  Because now
I can buy that thing that I want.  Yes I want an Ipod, I buy it.  I have one.
yes.
yes I want, uh, a Playstation, we have it there, it just collects dust
yes
because we don't play.  I have no interest, and my husband says you are not going to sit to play, I don't want to play with that either.
yes.
So it is there.  But also I see the benefit that I didn't waste my youth
Well, and also, you know, I, since we are going to have the baby I was thinking that we are going to put it to
Hm mm
not to watch television, but for, I was looking to see what programs I could let her see that are educational, but
Well, nowadays there are many programs
yes, but I, I still couldn't.
according. No, there are, there are many, uh, they have, uh on channel thirteen they have like two, that are alright, two, that have the approval of, of the school system here,
yes, but
in New York.
what, what happens to me is that, that I know that television, I am not going to have ay problems eh, to interest her.
Hm mm
And that I prefer, yes, I can, until at least she is three or four years old,
Hm mm
that she pursues her love for books, and music, and all that, I'd prefer, you know, that we continue on with that. I don't know
No
yea when the ba- the baby arrived, that, that I'm going to feel like being able to put, to have a bit of time, you know,
what I'd most like to do, if I do it, it'd be for half an hour a day, and it'd be a program that I know that
Hm mm Yea
you know, is educational.
Well, I, I've got con-, I don't know you, but I'm sure it'll be a great job, because for how I'm hearing you talk about it
it's everything that, in my mind, I'd see and I'd say, ok, this is what I want to do. This is what I want to see and when I talk with my husband he, ah,
I don't know, I don't know, but
But als-
but you, it's- I'm listening to you and I realize it's good, you know that everything you're saying is perfect. No, no there's nothing
that I'd do differently, like who says.
Well, the, the most difficult thing we have is that, no- we don't watch a lot of TV
Hm mm
But, and, if you go in to you- to our- our house, you'd think we watch a lot of TV with, because our house, uh, it has a,
it had those, fifty two inch TVs
Oh my goodness, okay
So, also, in past Christmases, we'd bought a TiVo
Okay.
then we record the old movies and programs that interest us but
Hm mm Hm mm
but this is nothing, we never watch ABC, NBC, nothing of those
Oh, yes, this is the best
Always is the Discovery Channel, pr something like this, like the History Channel
Yeah. Al right.
But for this reason, is why I don't want she watch television, my husband is watching less television
Oh yes.
Because when he is in home, and she is awake, we don't open it
Oh okay, okay.
So, that was one of the difficulties that we still have, becuse, as you know, he understand that I do not want her to watch the television
But he don't understand, if he is watching television, she is also watching
Is like give her permision
okay.
That's the problem I have with mine. I told him that I also don't watch television. I watch it in my dorm.
Hello
Hello
Hi, this is Zulma from Texas
Oh, I'm Manuel from Chicago
Hi Manuel
How are yo
Fine, and you?
Fine, Fine
Are you a dad again?
Excuse me?
Are you a dad again?
I'm dad again
Oh, there wasn't any problem?
No, everything was fine
Oh, that's nice, really nice
Right now is, like 5 minutes ago i was holding my baby in my arms
yes
but, they took him away for eat
Mmm, are you at home, or at the hospital?
At home, the day after, we left the hospital, the day after he was born
Ah, how great.
everything went well, not I, we were just, after he was born, the delivery, twenty-four hours, and that was all.
Mm. Now, to wake up every, every two hours.
yes.
Aha.
Every two yours you have to feed it.
Mmh.
Well, they are giving him, ah, breast milk.
mmh.
So, you don't have to go around worrying about, preparing milk, or anything.
Mmh.  Ah, well. Then, you don't even have t wake up.
It is fine.  No.  That- Nothing, for anything, I wake up just one or two times, but not more to be with them, there.
Mmh.
That's how it is.
I talked with, am, Jenny,
yes
and I also talked with your brother.  But, I forgot his name.
Ah, yes?
Because, yes, he started doing it.  Doing the study also.  Because, ah, Jenny stopped participating
How come, how come she hasn't said anything about that?
yes, the, the one, he told that me when i spoke. Because, pay attention, i talked two, two times i had to talk with a lady in New Yourk,
.
and she was talking but, know-ed few words in Spanish, she talked real bad
Oral
Then, i sent an e-mail to the person doing the study, and i asked what he thought about me, ah, if i had to talk with a non Spanish speaker
yes
And, he told me to grab it, and cut the call, because that one will not count.
Okay
Then, he sent an e-mail to everyone, saying that if you talked to a non Spanish speaker or English Speaker
eh, you don't talk to that person
yes, and got one of those e-mails too
yes
.
Then, it looks like, your brother told me that Jenny had read the message, and then, he decided to abandon
yes, yes he commented something like that, but, ah i, he didn't told me he will be giving out. Right from there he told me that,
he thought it was for her.
Ah, aha
Ah
No, no, i told your brother to tell him that, i was the one sending that e-mail, and that, i didn't send it for her, it was for the other lady, that she didn't talk Spanish too much at all, few words she knew in Spanish were
Em
Ah.
Because I think she speaks Spanish very well.
yes, she speaks well
Mhm.
It is, she is funny, you get in the car of hers, ah, she brings a van. A Caravan.
Aha.
At once, to me, I found it weird. I went up, and, brings one, when I was there in Nebraska with them,
Mhm.
uh, I've been using it a few days, and I grabbed the box which has all the CDs
Mhm.
I said it, to see if by chance he brings music in Spanish
Mhm.
Here, then, you will not believe, they brought sixty or seventy CDs
Mhm.
all in Spanish. And then I asked him, hey, Jenny, I say, you get that, as you bring music in Spanish? I say, Why not bring in Spanish? No, he says, I like to hear pure Spanish, if I do not like it in English.
Ah.
Oh, I said, okay.
Mhm.
yes, she knows everything, I do not know how long I have to practice Spanish or Spanish speaking. But, he speaks very well.
Eh. Ah, is she already married to your brother? Because it sounded like your brother's children are great yeah.
Ah, what happens, is that she had the boy from before.
Ah, oh, she already had,
But, they have like, I am not sure, approximately four years.
Aha
Three or four years.
yes, ah, o/
Yeah and she had, she has children from a previous marriage.
yes.
Ah, they have a daughter only,
Mmh
by my brother
Because, I don't remember what we had to talk about, but your brother was telling me that, em, no, I was asking him if, if he had problems living there in Nebraska,
as there are almost no Hispanics.  And, he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives, there are no, there are no Hispanics, he is the only Hispanic.
yes.
I, I told him that I had had problems with people looking at him funny, or talking to him, and he told me no, that he had only had problems once with,
with the dad of another one of the children who competed in wrestling with the, with his children.
Ah, yes.  One, one of them competes in wrestling.
Mmh.
But, you know, wherever you go you are going to find good and bad people.
Of course, yes, that always happens.
yes.
But, well, he told me that no, that he didn't have many problems, that in fact, he invited everyone, to the Christmas party, and all.
yes, of that yes I realized. They're not so, I think that where it's a town where there aren't many Hispanics, it's better than not having any,
Mhm.
and you know, in, where there are many Hispanics, there are many, well, now they start the bad friendships, and all that, the bad people.
Of course, eh.
Then, the Americans now start to see badly, now no, to, to him.
Mhm.
That is, to a Hispanic. They start to see that they're all the same, they think.
Of course.
And like there there aren't, no, they don't have,
Prejudices, yes, mhm.
yes. They don't think, that one is Mexican, this one isn't going to do this, he's not going to do the other.
Mhm, mhm.
No, n- I think, there haven't, they haven't had experience with many Mexicans.
yes.
And, m- therefore, there aren't, they haven't, the Mexicans have not, well, there isn't anyone who commits evil deeds.
Mhm.
Now since the Mexicans have a party, one or two o'clock in the morning, and the music and all that, and so.
Mhm.
Yes, nothing beyond that up to now. Immediatly after a while more Hispanics should begin to arrive.
yes, certainly. Pass.
Yeah
And you, what music do you listen to ?
Texan music.<from Texas>
Texan, yes. Mhm.
I like it a lot, I lived a lot, ah, I lived good times here in Texas. I like it a lot like the Tex-Mex, what do you say
Mhm.
All this music.
Mhm
And yet, here almost, at times I don't find discos like this. I search for them but here (the people) they do not listen to much, they do not hear a lot of it.
Ah.
then no. But, yes, sometimes when my brothers come or I go to them, I bring music from here.
And the traditional music of Mexico, don't you like it ?
I like the northern music, usually the northern.
Mhm. Mhm.
yes, like the traditional one, but like mariachi and all like those, almost no. Bands also.
No ? Mhm. Ah, good. How about the regular Spanish music ?
Yes.
that, from any country, I don't know how.
Oh, what kind I like to listen to?
Mhm.
I like to listen to Colombian very much
Colombian
yes, music like, there are many,
Cumbia?
Yes, like many, yes, many cumb- yes, like very mellow music, no?
Mhm.
Not very strong.
Ah, OK
Yeah, I carry, in my car, I always carry music. And, if someone gets in, I raise the volume, no, I like to listen to it, but very softly, only softly
Mhm
Only to, like ca- like music relaxes me, sometimes
Sure, yes, it's good to listen to music in the car, yes. It ent- it's entertaining, even more so if you're in the car by yourself, it's good to listen to music
yes
I'm not one of those people that are listening to music constantly, I have friends that listen to music constantly. And now that people have those, ah MP threes,
yes
where they can have eighty, a hundred, two hundred songs, constantly in their ears, listening to music.
No, that's good, at least for me, I don't like it so much
Yes, I don't, I don't like it, yes. I, once in a while, yes, yes, like that to relax in the car, or if I go to do some exercise, also I like listening to music.
yes, over there people that can't, can't sleep.  Oh, my brother, the one that lives in Nebraska.
Aha.
he, there was a time where he would fall asleep, and if he didn't have music, he wouldn't go to sleep
Oh.
And I would tell him, turn off the radio already, you can not sleep without music, not without, without music, one can not sleep well.  He said, I wake up, and I wake u happy, I fall asleep, and I fall asleep happy.
Each one.
yes, I like to wake up to music.  Then, my alarm, is also, is, is a player.  Then, when, the alarm in the morning, instead of being on of those sounds that
gives you a heart attack,
yes
it is, it is the music that it has there inside the player.  Then, like that it is fine, because one wakes up little by little.
yes.
Aha
And, you go, you get out there in, I don't know, dances or discos?  In Texas?
When I arrived here in Houston, I would go out a lot to dance salsa.
yes.
yes. I found a group of people over there where ivent to school, that would dance salsa and I went out a lot.  But, not anymore.  Now I don't have any time to go out anywhere.
Aha
But, afterwards, I did not, I, like I got tired of going out because I had already gone to all of the same places, and you see the same people, and
always, the places were but very full of people.  Then, youvent to dance, and it was almost impossible to dance, and people would step on you or would hit you when they were doing turns.  Then, no, I already, I, I got tired of that.
ye.
Besides, that you must pay so much to get into the places.
like that.
It costs ten or fifteen dollars, to enter the places. So then, No. not any more. Like now, I prefer, if I go out, I prefer to go to a place that is more peaceful
oh,
yes, just is there and talk, and
Here there is a dancing hall, where Mexican groups come
mhm
like northern, and all that
yeah
You are not going to believe, they charge fifty dollars the ticket.
Wow. But they groups, groups that are well known or? yeah
yeah, yes, yes, groups, yes.  And even like that, people stay outside, that don't get to come in.
Wow. But, because is, is that, you live in very large city.
yes.
So then,
I went one time, and I did like it, because is beautiful
mhm
what happens, is that you can't even walk.
yes, and no. That is the problem, yes.
Since they are, they bring groups, oh, good Mexican groups, everyone wants to listen to them.
sure
The room has capacity for four thousand people, and that was the only time I went, I don't like to go anymore
yes
I don't go out anymore, it is to much trouble. O.K

oh, OK, OK, OK
so I don't know where
Loo, you know the, the, the subject of today, right?
yes, about music.
Aha, aha

That, who have sang that music music very and Alejandra, Alex Bueno, I always, I grab, ah - CDs from the library
Ah, yes
to listen to them.  I also like Reggae, I don't know if you listen to reggaeton.  It is in vogue now.
yes, yes I have heard some, yes
from "Daddy Yanky" "Don Omar", "Tengo Calderon","Ivi Queen"
And of, And of. So living in Chicago has not caused you to maintain the music that you listened to there in Puerto Rico? No?
No, it's not, almost.
Why so many
almost the same
Why no. There is a lot, there is a lot of variety, that is there is a lot of variety in Chicago.
Right, Right.
So you haven't missed it much?
No, no, no,
How great!
There in Puerto Rico I listened to los Boleros, and Salsa but I don't really like Boleros that much, and Salsa either because they are not music you can dance to.
Of course.
They are more romantic.
Of Course.
I do a lot, but we use the Merengue a lot.
Right.
such as: Olga Tañon, Elvis Crespo
ah, yes, yes, yes.
A, here in Chicago they do a lot, ah Puerto Rican parade.
Ah, yummy.
And they get invited, they get invited. This year was "Ivi Queen", she's the the the the Regaetton Babe
in 2004, Elvis came
Ah, what
Crespo
ah, really?
yes, then
yes, here in Idaho, no one comes
No
No
Here they have a Boricua party, in September, and they brought tego Calderón. ah, they always have a lot of concerts, at the parks, outdoors
Ay, that's so cool
And they're free. They come a lot, they, ah, they do something that says "Viva Chicago"
Yeah
And they bring music from Colombia, Mexico, everywhere, Puerto, the, the World
Then you don't feel so far away from your place of origin, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
you have all that
yeah
yeah, here in Idaho, they, there's nothing here. The only music we have here is more, like Mexican, like
yeah
I don't know how it's called, but it is like "Saltaditas" or I don't know how it will be.
Aha
But it is music that I have never heard not even over there in Chile.
No,
and of course, over there in Chile one listens ore to music I don't know how, Boleros also and
Aha
things like that.  But of course here you miss it, because it is not heard to, it is not heard much about that.  And nobody comes around here either.  So one doesn't have with
tru
Aha, aja
e or any of that.  And yes I missed it so much that, I am listening right now the satellite radio
Aha
And with that I have been able, I have been able to remember now many things in Spanish because after ten years finally I would be listining to songs that are being played now
that which is the Reggaeton and all of that
Aha, aha
I did not have an idea about that, because it has been about ten years that I did not listen to music in Spa-nish
ohh, because now the here in Chicago we have a station that is, ni nehundred three point one - FM
And it is music in Spanish
That sings Reggaeton.  The whole damn day
Oh, terrific
Aha, so, especially when one is on the car driving.
uh huh
that you don't get bored because you put the, the radio at full volume and and the ride does
Of course.
very quickly, and you don't get bored, you don't sleep in the car, or anything.
Of course.
Listening to music.
yes, it's good-, it's good to have music in Spanish because,
uh huh
because the English is lovely but it's not the same.
No, no
But it isn't what you've grown up with or anything like that, eh
uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
yes, I now I'm happy with, with being able to hear music in Spanish again, because really it makes a difference
uh huh
In the soul and all that.
It's like that music that, I don't know if you are listening-, heard the music that they have eh, ah when they are, one is waiting for a person
who put the phone on hold to speak? I don't like that music. because eh, ah It's music like of, like classical and it's music like when you are going
For getting to see
like when you are going on the elevator.
Of course
you have music. of, for me, for me.
aha
beautiful and should not change it. to music, merengue or bachata ah, or music
clear
ah, like, like cumbias cumbias that are nice.
and give more encouragement, no?
aha, aha, aha
instead of an upset because, I'd be waiting so at least you dance while, no?
aha, aha, aha no,is that one falls asleep waiting.
yes.
I was looking right now waiting for fifteen minutes. so that I could communicate to.
really?
yeah, last time I waited half an hour, and when I was going to communicate with someone for allegedly hanged at eleven p.m.
is hanging and calls.
really?
aha, aha, aha.
me
many times have you spoken?
two with it.
oh yeah! and I wear with it.
yes
is thirteen
wow ! then you call, i was waiting for them to call me
Aha
then you can call and wait
no, no, if they don't call, you can call them after 5 pm, you can call anyone but only after 5
Anyone you want
Ah, then you can speak more than once in a day ?
No, no, only once
Once a day
yes
yes, the other time, i spoke with my sister because we called both at the same time
Aha
And my sister lives in Atlanta, in Georgia
ohh
And i speak with her. She is the one recording for this program when you listen that girl speak and telling what to do and all that
aha, aha
she, she's my sister
Ohh
Then when she made the recording she told me to call and be able to listen and speak with her, it was the only time i did it and from that moment i didn't spoke with her ever
Oh
So this is my first time speaking with someone else.
¡Oh, lord!, you still have a lot, yeah, you have to do twenty three more.
Yeah. So i sharpened up and that's why i called, because i was waiting for someone to call me, but nothing happened.
Because, because the last time it was Politics.
Right
But i called and nobody picked, picked up the phone, no one, nobody.
It's scary, ¿right?
But... right, but i, they call me every afternoon, around five o p.m., somebody here that, that
Oh, yeah
That if i want to pick up the phone to talk. But since i don't pick up the phone, i don't know what they're talking about.
Oh
How is the music?, this is the second time i call, i
Sure
I have spoken to a lot of people, from Nebraska, from Philadelphia, from Miami
Oh, i see
Yeah
No, i like the music subject, it's simpler; the other time, when it was a subject, right, i think it was about immigration.
Oh, yeah, yeah, i also talked
That's kinda scarier than speaking about Politics and Immigration, because
Aha
What's up, it doesn't say.  I don't know
About, about politics I don't like it, but I talked about immigration, about music about marriage I talked
Ah, yes
about cell phones, well a lot.  Imagine I still need like nine nothing more I still need thanks to God.
And after twenty or so they don't call anymore, right?
After twenty or so then you wait two or three months, they send you the check to you rhome.
Ah, that's good.
yes.
Ok, I better get on it and start calling then.
yes, after five in the afternoon you can call who, you can ah, I mean you dial the phone that is there
Of course.
that you have to call.  And there you communicate.  But they have to be after five in the afternoon, because at that time it is that they change the
the the Subject they are talking about, the subject.
ah, OK, and every day it is different?
Well the other time, I talked like five times about marketing ah I talked five times.
Ah, five days in a row.
I spoke one now with this two about music I talked three about marriage I talked just one about cell phones, well many subjects.
Ah.
But, but they have not changed them, but now that that they put a lady talking, well they have changed the topics.
Sure
But first you have, you had to talk Well, a lot, of a lot, the topics say, ah Almost always they left the same topics, so that people talked
Sure
Look then, ah
Ah
You, ah, when you're driving, do you listen to music or not?
Me, yeah, yes I listened to music too but, ah, I also listen, but a lot, there was a lot of time I stopped listening to music and started listening
Problems, conversational programs
Aham
Political
Aham
But it's like someone after a lot of time you get used to this and forget to listen to music and you spend days without listening to music
Aham, aham.
And then you realize that your music, I mean, music really changes you, changes your mood
Aham.
For, for the rest of the day, doesn't it?
Aham,
So now, I started listening more music for to have more will, more energy
Aham
Because, I don't know, of the Latin blood, I guess
Ok, OK
But one needs
yes, yes, yes
Needs that. You know, that kind of dancing music
OK
yes, because i almost don't listen that kind of music here
OK
Right?
No, no merengue, neither salsa, neither reggaeton, nothing, just reggaeton
no, i like all kind today
OK
Before, when i was in Chile, i didn't like the salsa, neither merengue, nothing like that. Now that I'm here i love it.
ok, ok, OK
Now the only thing i need is to learn how to dance, no more, but i love it
Do you watch TV when they are dancing?
No, nothing here, nothing about latino, neither merengue, nothing here
Oh, no
No, because here are just a few Latinos
ok, OK
Most of them here are Mexicans
aha
but on TV, on the radio, there's nothing in Spanish, nothing Latino.
No movies or anything?
On the TV no, nothing.
No?
No, nothing.
Uh, um.
So, we're in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, blessed! I imagine.
yes, it's boring.
Uhh
Boring; when I went to California to visit it was
Betsy, hello how are you?
one time yes it is me Tammy again, find and you, oh my God
here sitting down, to have what can you tell me about social assistance or about whatever because I don't have an idea
no yes here well I think that some things are good but other things no
aha, aha
especially the of older people they don't don't give them enough money or or it is not about the money but that they need medical assistance they don't pay totally for the pills
oh
so it is more difficult for them ehm you know to take their pills because they have to think that I have to pay the pills or I have to eat
aha, oh
because they have to pay more and sometimes too sometimes there are people that abuse I knom people that well they are no my friends for but I know that they have been abusing
mmha
of those uses that real persons, that other persons really need
mha
I see but it is difficult I have mine sisinlaw, my husband's mom
mha, aha
and she is partially on assistance but no, they don't help her so much, and there has to, he needs to search coupons and things like that to see if she can buy the medicine in a different place so that it is cheaper or
buy a medicine this month or buy another medicine the other month
ther is no how bad, aha
because the can not have all of the and that is bad because if  they don't take things like they are supposed to take them
aha, no
they will not help you, so that is scary
and and that is welfare or pension or
yes that is mija from welfare
ah o that is. yeah I can imagine
mja assistance they give her for them here they do not give you a lot so it is hard have to prove show them that it is real
you have that but anyway and if you do what do what feels and you are working
mja
and if you do not know they will not pay well, but you they pay twenty dollars or a little more then twenty dollars from the
mja
Or I believe les then twenty dollars from the limit they give you they do not help
ja
i say they are twenty dollars more then the limit they have but I say is not that much
now
and they do not want that they prefer that you do not work
yeah
to be able for them to help but with the help they give you it is not enough for you to survive
but now but they do not pay all the medications that you need
no then that is what you feel maybe well they can not will not help you
yeah
they do not want to help because you make a lot supposely, it is not that much you can not survive with that and you would have to stop working for them to help
And the help they give you it's not enough, there's still
it's not much, right, so it's hard, it's very hard for people to try that, i think i can imagine that's why there's people that work under the table
Right, right
Because, they can't say they're working, because then they don't help you and they don't have enough, and if you have children, well, that's another thing
Yeah, but after you're eighteen they don't help you anymore, when your children are eighteen years old they don't help you anymore
No, no, so i was watching my son, my crazy kid, he comes here to my house and says to me, hey mom why don't you want to apply for the government, to get sandwiches
Uh
I say, hey, we do to much to get sandwiches and i think i give you to buy sandwiches, i give you money
Right
Four children, wait until four people in the house want you to make like twenty four thousand dollars
Right
that's not enough, a year, that's not enough
Twenty four thousand dollars a year, oh my goodness, for four people, no
Not for four people, specially if within those people is a baby
Right
Because that, i say that's a lie, i was showing my husband and i tell him "those people are crazy, who's gonna make", i mean, where you work and where you live, because here, where i live
Right
yeah, what a miracle that when my son, when he moved he found an apartment near us, that was seven hundred and twenty five a month, and that's cheap
Yeah, but that doesn't include utilities.
Right, no, it didn't include any of that, so you can imagine if with two
Aha, oh OK more expensive
so I say that if a person who has four people at home and makes twenty-four thousand cannot, cannot
it is not enough
so for me that's why I always talk to my children, be careful, work take care of your credit and save your money.
OK, that they don't spend on things they don't need
because what do you think, you remember I talked to you yesterday
yes, aha, you already came back
my sone is back, the older one moved he is at my home again he fought with his girlfriend and the girl did something bad to him and this man my son when you do something bad to him he says goodbye and like that you never see him again
boy
so he took everything, my husband went there and took all his things and now there is nothing of his in that apartment.
wow
now he went
that girl must have done something really bad to him mm
aha, very bad that this man got like that he called me mom well and I tell him I support you so come here here I am going to convince him to go to school because
because yes already and when he moved in with his girlfriend he wasn't working, oh, aha
yes he was but now he is I want well he can go eh eh people at work told him that he can go to school in the morning
aha
and work after so they help him so I tell him well I say if you move here, if you go to school and I don't charge you rent
OK that is good aha
but if you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because I want him to finish school
OK of course, mja
because it is going to, I mean too many things especially with him if he does not want to finish school it is going to be difficult to achieve things so I want
mja or have a good career also they are not going to send him to McDonald's to work forever
mja, so, yes, yes because that is what I tell him because then something happens and you don't do you feel you are going to end up asking help and you are not going to have, you are a man I say no
mja
it is not need it is so young but not finish things having us here we can help him and he doesn't want to accept it
mja
I always give him the example of the people we know, look you don't want to end up there, work hard
no, he doesn't want to because he doesn't want to have, that the government won't even, doesn't even help him at all
mm, no yes and how is it there in Canada with the, with this of, of insurance
well here they make you work I when we just got here ahh just arrived from El Salvador which was fifteen years ago they gave us a, they rented an apartment for us they gave us a
mja
bed and furniture and that but and we were on welfare
aha, mja, aha
for a few months from there, because we went to school and there my parents got a job and my brother and I were in high school
and from there but from there since my parents were working this and they helped him my brother because my brother was fifteen years old I think
aha
and I OK, and I was already eighteen they did no longer help him just for my brother but I went into High School and I didn't work until, until when
yes but they put me in, in the welfare sometimes I got into it but I believe that here they help you a little bit more because they give you a medicine card
aha
mja, and this and has to display in the shop where one goes shopping for medicine and and they pla- pay well that was the last time that I asked for assistance
but now ah now I don't know how it will be, it must be harder
no yes I don't know I we when my husband went from, he was in the Air Force
uh huh, mja
then we came here and him neither they pay you as much that was like in ninety-two
uh huh
and then when we came here it hadn't been enough to be able to pay the rent so that then we got for a month
uh hh
for enough to help us and for as much time how long it took him to get work so that it took him a month
how good
well a month to get work but you know the next check then we ook that month and we went out once from there but when one goes to the store with those the, the one of these that they give you that like they're false papers
really?
the people you, if when you go shopping that that was years so that now I think that they give you a card
oh uh huh
but the people look at you badly
they look at you as if you are from another planet
uh huh that that yest because no because no because they are giving you help you you see that you can work, yes we can work but they didn't have I with two small children I say no I can't work once because where am I going to leave the little children that I have to pay someone and I don't have anything to pay them with
mha aha yeah sure
and then I told my husband never ever, never
no
I say that I work wherever before getting into this and I he always has told me that it's low and I don't put my family like this
no
so because it is like they look at you poorly I say no man because you are asking for a little help.
like that, mja
because I things didn't go well or because it is very difficult
surely they, the same happened to them and they look at you bad and it is like that
aha, they don't remember, people who don't remember that
ma
but I don't I am not like that when I see people who have needs I say this can happen to anyone it can happen one day it happened to me
oh yeah of course
so and well ah I say
Why look bad at people who get help from the government, what help right?, it's not a big deal.
Right, well, i say, they're not stealing, it's not like they went crazy and steal, they're
Right, right.
They went because they had to, and ask for help, maybe they didn't even want to, but they had to
Right, right, and that, it's like a little paper that says that the government helps you, and people know
Right
It's not money, i mean, they don't send you a check to your house or to your account.
No, no, uh, the, what they, well, they send you a check
Right
Well, that was on ninety two, that i remember. They send you a check, and then they send you a book.
Right
a little one, that had that money, like the monopoly kind
Oh, oh
And it was like five dollars, twenty dollars, and you had to get it from there, give it to the person, and they didn't give you back the change
Oh, no
And you had to try to have the exact thing, because well, i mean no, it's just
And the government, it made you think like it was a shame
Right, and then i had to, they wanted to be sure you didn't use it for alcohol, so that looks bad, i mean, they should, i think that now with that card thing they have
Oh, um, right

Mhm
So you know, she is, she's a lot to deal with, huh?
Ah, no she is pretty good. She has her moments and, you know, she doesn't pay attention to what I am saying
But
Yeah
when I talk to her and I ask her to do something for me, she does it. Because, if not, then, you know, I am in charge of, of that she does it
yeah
because I want that she, you know, that she behaves well
Yeah Oh, how good.
So that,
Ah.
she doesn't have an opportunity to be bad, let's say.
Oh, boy. And you live with, ah, another person
Yes, with my husband.

No-
An other nin- girl comes, or boy comes?
I don't know.
What Oh, you don't know. Oh.
So that, you know, the only thing that we want, is that it's healthy.
That is good. Oh, eh, it makes, it makes, and- warm in Miami today. right?
Uh, no Today, uh, was not very hot, today was pretty, pretty, pretty hot, but it was windy. So, it was quite windy. But, probably, the temperature was not yet at eighty, eig- eighty five, eighty six, kind of.
Oh, oh, boy
But, the humidity was not too high. So, it was not a very, very hot day.
oh.
Because, what doesn´t, doesn´t , affect here, not only the temperature.
Right.
but humidity. So, we have, normally, I think that about seventy, eigh- eighty percent of, of, of humidity.
Mhm.
And when you leave the house.
Right.
you know, as soon as you leave, you start sweating. Because, it´s like if somebody is giving you a, a wet blanket.
Uh,
It´s very, you know, very sticky and,
yes.
but, now we´re getting in, in the time that is not so, so bad, it´s hot, but humidity low ve-
Oh.
But, you know, how, for example, I can wash my hair,
Right.
uh, and I can be the whole night with wet hair
Oh.
because it doesn't get dry because there is so much humidity
Oh, boy
And, especially, if I wash it in the morning and go out and I have it in a, in a ponytail, in a ponytail,
Aha Oh.
my hair stays wet the whole day
Oh, wow
So, you know, it is always n- not so much the heat as much as the humidity, I think.
If.
So, And, is it cold over there, or not yet?
Oh, n- it is not cold, it is maybe, sixty
Wow
yeah it is cold today.  But, you know, that, that, that that But it is very u- yeah, no,
And when you, ehm, usually have snow
What?
When do you, usually, starts to snow, the time of the year with snow, and all of that?
Oh, maybe oh, the other day.  It is, se- se- eigh- no, seventy.  The other day are seventy and, but today, it is very cold.  And, one is every day
the change, i- is, it changes much.  Maybe today it is si- sixty, tomorrow fifty, you know, like that
So, ehm, But, when does it start to snow?
I don't know.  I don't know.
Because, I thought that, that it snowed in New York.
Eh, in New York ? Who ?
Didn't you tell me that you are, eh, that you live in New York ?
Yes
Okay
Yes, I live in New York.
I thin- Okay.
Mhm.
Okay, I was thinking that it was snowing in New York, that's why I asked you.
You speak too fast.
Oh, sorry.
Where, ah, where am ? You are in Honduras ?
No, no, eh, my parents are from the Dominican Republic.
Oh.
But I was born in Puerto Rico,
Oh, you, your mother is Dominican ?
and my father too.
Oh, that's why ? Here in New York, there are many dominicans.
And Puerto Ricans too.
En- yes. Many Puerto Ricans and many dominicans. I live in Bronx.
Mhm.
And, it has, it, in, the people are very poor in the Bronx, you know.  But, all, it all, you know, eh, is that? Is that?
All of the don- and, and the blacks also. So, there are blacks, Dominican, on, Mexicans,
Mhm.
in the Bronx, and, Puerto Ricans, and Haiti, Haitians.
Uh huh, from Haiti.
You know?
Yes, from Haiti.
Me?
From Haiti.
Yes, Haiti, yes. And, what else? Yeah. Jamaica, Jamaicans.
From Jamaica
Uh huh. So, the people are poor. They don't have a lot of money, there in the Bronx. You know?  Do you have a lot of money? Do you have a lot of pesos?
I don't think so.  I mean, we have a house,but my husband is the only one who works. And, we have to, you know,
Yes.
No, we don't have a luxurious life.
Uh huh.
Um, we have enough money for what we need to buy, food, Pampers,
Yeah
You know, pay the, the, the light bill, whatever.  But we don't have, don't have anything for vacations, you know, nothing like that.
Yes.
We have what you need. But,
Oh.
you know, and nothing else have a car, we have two cars. And here, usually, people have
Aha.
two cars.
Oh, you don't have two cars?
No. No, we only have one car.
Oh, but do you live in a big or small house?
No, we have a house, right here, it's a small house.
Oh.
Eh, we have three bedrooms
Oh.
and two bathrooms. It's not very big. the houses are very expensive here
Oh yeah, yes.
So, you know, we only have the necessities.
Yeah.
But it's not a luxurious life.
Wow. And?
And we do not have, you know, we're not starving, and no, we do not lack clothes,
Yes.
But since I'm not working, I keep my daughter with me,
Yes.
we find it difficult.
And the, clothing is really expensive too, right?
am, I believe so, we, look, I,
Yes
and, you know, we save lotsnof money.  But, I don't go to the stores, I don't buy many things, you know,  I don't go
yes
no shopping because the, the clothing is very espensive.
yes
really, we buy clothes regularity, let see, when we can go to Cotsco.
Oh,
o, o Sams, or somrthing like that
yes
And We see something that is our size, and we will buy it.
Oh.
but, I, go to the store, no, no. I don't do that. What,
Oh, my goo-
You know, and, this, I don't care because, you know, I, yes,yes, I had clothes to wear, I don't care brand names or what,
whatever
yes
no to be dirty, and no to be
yeah
Hello?
Hi.
Hi, is Sulma.
Oh, I am Manuel from
Hi
Chicago, how are you?
fine and you?
fine, fine, working.
Are you working right now?
yes.
oh,
yes, I just saw the call and I thought, well, entertain my self for a few, rest a little while
oh, of course, yes,
eh
A break, huh
How are you?
Fine, fine, you work in construction you had said, right?
yes.
yes, oh well. yes. Uh, mm, yes. We have to talk about traveling, what places have you traveled to?
Mm, the, the, the best that you can do right?
yes sure you can go to vacations
OK yes to Mexico
OK
nothing else to Mexico and here in the united states i have to go to different parts
and oh
ahh from vacations not to work from vacations
but OK
heh
where had you been in united states?
in Texas
OK
when i was in Texas traveled from there to here
mmm
i have family here and there
oh
now I'm travel here, i'm going there or Nebraska with my brother, he is there
mmm
i have family in Arizona too, all my uncles
OK
almost every part of my mom family is here in the united states
Oh.
furthermore in different states, or I have another in Wisconsin, I go over also sometimes.
Mm.
Yeah, that's close by.
Mhm.
and well, What can I tell you? When you have time to travel, I prefer to do it by car, driving here
Aha.
because you can stop and rest whenever you like.
Sur-
and when when you're with the family, you have to stop to rest.
Mhm.
If you go by bus, you may only stop once and it's very uncomfortable.
Mhm.
And yeah, that's all.
But, ah, what you went to Arizona, you went to, to visit some tourist sites, to visit the
Yeah, Grand Canyon
Yes, you went to the Grand Canyon.
Yes.
Uh huh, and did you enjoy it?
Oh, yes it's beautiful.
Yes, yes.
It is very pretty, though it is, like very well it is a desert area actually
Of course, yes
but it has many very pretty things.
Mm. And to Mexico you have only gone to see your family or visit other places also?
Well I have family in two states, in Durango and in Monterrey
Aha
ah, Monterrey has ah, it is, it is like what I tell you? Well no they have many places like touristic, where to go for a stroll, eh, to see
Mm.
it is an industrial city, there are many well, I'll tell you? there are many things with which you can, there are not, there are things like that but it is very pretty.
Mhm.
It has they are two like I don't know exactly what they are, like rivers one is called horse tail
Mmh.
they are lika huge waterfalls, very high
Mmh.
what, e-, many people visit it from different parts to
Mm.
It is very pretty
And would you like going to another country in the world?
Oh, yes, I would like to see Alaska.
Alaska?
Yes
Mm
Go to, see how it is
Is very cold there
eh, what, exactly the true definition of cold weather
Mm
I would like to be over there.
Yes, my, the boss I used to have, went to Antartic, in other words the South Pole.
Yes.
Yes, to see the penguins. Because the penguins are only in the South Pole.
Yes.
and ah she loved it there are cruises you can take to go to Alaska you take them from California and they take you to Alaska.
Yes, yes I knew about that.
and then you get to see all the glaciers and all the Mm.
Yes, yes, I would really like to go there
Mm.
but sometimes there's no time.
Ah, yes, no.
And when
It costs time and money.
wh-, when you have time sometimes you don't have money
Yes. Yes, it's difficult, no, it's, it's, I li-
What, what happens is that
Aha.
hello? Yes, tell me.
No, no, tell what you were going to
Oh, what happens is that, let me tell you, like when you go on vacation, one, what, well, at least I, ah, eh I try to
go out but where my family is, go to visit my family some times ah
Sure, mhm.
it's tough, two or three years without seeing them
Mhm.
if you have an opportunity well I prefer of course, to see my family, traveling as well, I don't know.
Mhm.
Eh, we are like, we are very close, we see each other a lot
Yes.
and better, there are times in which we have to travel we better make plans to go and see the family better
Sure. Yes, it's difficult to balance going to see the family and to go on vacation and even more when you get married because then you have to go to see your family and the
family of your wife or husband
Oh, speaking about, that's another problem.
Then your time runs out, and vacations and the money, and all goes, it goes there.
Yeah, well, mostly time, because the, uh, let me tell you that i don't spend much money, when you go to see the family you don't spend as much as when you go to
Yeah, yeah
i don't know, when you go on vacation, to know different, uh, cities or countries
Um
There you do spend a lot, because you have to pay for hotels, food
Um, yeah, right.
And, obviously, you go out, wherever you go you're spending money.
Um.
when going out with the, to visit the family, you do spend, i won't say you don't, but
Um
you don't spend as much
Sure, yeah.
It's very different.
Yes, yes, i love travelling, i hope that nos that I'm starting to work as a nurse and start having money, i cant travel.
That's good.
To the, wherever i want to go. But yeah, I've been in Europe, and i've been in Costa Rica and Guatemala, i've been in Mexico but only in Mexico City
in Puerto Vallarta and in Chiapas
Oh, ¿yeah?
Oh, i was in, uh, in San Cristóbal, and, uh, ¿where else was i in Chiapas?, uh, i don't remember. But, uh, and i was in Taxco too, when i was
oh, Taxco
yeah, when i was in mexicano
vacations?
Oh, yeah,yeah i have a friend that loves to travel, she loves staying in different countries, shes currently stayed two years in
in taiwan and when i saw her in mexico, she had already been six months in mexico, so she had already been through the entire country.
and when i found her, she was in chiapas, so then we went to san cristobal and guajaca, then we went to taxco and came back. um,
i came back, she stayed.
yeah, me with vacations.
oh, from the city of mexico, she was studying.
oh.
she was studying, so, she took some classes for an independent study, while she was studying and taking classes, she was traveling through Mexico
mm, that's good.
yeah yeah. so then, when i went travelling with her, i didn't really spend much because we stayed at hostels, i don't remember how you guys call them.
but i mean, like you can stay, so you stay, and sleep with a lot of people in the same room, right? but we didn't really pat much, we payed like
two or three dollars a night
mm
but most of them are students, so you have to share with people you don't know.
but like, you know you're safe, there's no danger, only over there.
no, yeah, they're people that
these are,
you are doing the same thing
ah, exactly, people doing the same thing.
yes come to travel and who wants to spend such little money so then that was fine, but I also went to Europe and I stayed there for a month also
traveling in Europe, but it was quite expensive but my parents helped me because it was my graduation present from college, but after that I was here in Houston
I've only been to Aruba which is on the north coast of Venezuela
Okay.
Aha. That is, it is a small island like Puerto Rico but I did not like it, a, it is a pretty famous ah tourist site in the Caribbean there, but I did not like it
because Puerto Rico is also an island and Puerto Rico is much greener and there are mountains and this little island, Aruba is a desert, there is nothing there
absolutely nothing the only thing is that the beaches are very nice but apart from the beaches there is nothing more to do
There is desert?
In Aruba, yes.
Yes.
Yes, it is dry, there is nothing, absolutely nothing as it is quite plain and there are only stones ah, that's all, it is all rocky, eh the
there are rocky beaches also
Yes.
Yes, the sand is white and the water is very clearly and you can see can see through water, it is very light blue
Look.
but but there is nothing more to do, absolutely nothing else
Mm.
so, then I did not like it, but why yes, all of my family is in Puerto Rico, except that I have a sister living in Florida
the, the rest are in Puerto Rico but nevertheless, and now, for example, this year I went to see my sister in Florida and then in August
and then I went to Puerto Rico to see my family and in December I will be going to Canada to see my boyfriend's family
so then I have no time or money to go anywhere else
Well yeah.
because it is, it is three trips, three flights or rather, I have, I have no money left to go to any other place then I believe that after I finish school I will take
free time on vacation before I start, I start working to
To rest.
Yes, or for, and to go somewhere I want to go, a different place, not to see my family
Well that is good because once you start working, if you are barely starting, you do not know exactly how you are going to have, well, it will practically change your rhythm in life, no?
Mhm. Yes. Yes, and usually when you start working they do not allow you to take a vacation for sometime ah
Mhm.
there are places where during the first three months you cannot take any vacations to other. The first six months you cannot take any vacations
You see.
then, yes. How is your baby?
Oh, very well, thank you.
Yes, yes. She's growing.
Yes, that's good, growing, growing since the day she was born. She was born on Wednesday. On Saturday she had an appointment with the pediatrician, we took her
Aha. Aha. Aha.
and she had grown nearly a pound
Aha.
uh, the doctor was talking to us, right? and we are talking for a while, he was telling us well, its good hes gotten fatter because,
when they are born, the regular thing to do is to make them loose weight.
mhm
and and this girl didn't lose it, on the contrary she gained weight.
ha
that's very good.
yeah
mm, i hope she stays that way, i don't want no problems.
yea yeah, otherwise no, at first the grow up very fast
yeah
too fast i would say, until they're at least two they start too , i mean, until, they continue.
betsy, yeah oh hi alezz
oh betsy, are you talking to Alex again, how are you?
I'm good, thank you, that's good um
good, yeah well, the theme about the trip
is very interesting
yea very interesting
better than politics, what ever it is.
yeah I've had a lot of different opinions
yeah
well do you want to start this time
sure, ok, oh well, if i had money, i would like to go to hawaii, and would like to go there all the time, for about 2 months
i say
and why?
because I've never been there, and my husbands grandmother says its very pretty, because she always goes, i would like to go in a cruise.
is your husband from canada?
yeah yeah he is
a cruise would be fantastic.
i want to go on because I've never been on one, ive never been on a cruise ship before, what about you?
well i once went to spain.
ha
and to Gibraltar and I loved it but the south of Spain where the beaches are
Oh yeah
Uh, they were beautiful sceneries
Aham
But I didn't have the money to stay for long
Aham
And that always frustrated me and then If i got a prize and had the money
Aham, yeah
And also the time and sure when one has money then one has to have time as well
Sure
And then I'd love to travel to Spain and visit the
Oh sure
There are a lot of castles and interesting things there
Aham
And a lot of things from from from the old world, a lot of Roman things oh it's interesting, it's it's knowing history
Aham
But uhm you need money, it's it's a expensive country especially for meandering
Aham
Yeah and no no it's not dangerous where I'm from, Colombia, it's very dangerous
Aham
you do not enjoy it even though it is a beautiful country
mhm
one always fears the security of the country
yeah
no, Spain is better,
ah and if they were not so many wars I would like Israel
dangerous
yes but no, but without war
yes
that's where I would like to go
Colombia is also a fantastic country, if there were no war and
and
you have landscapes and tremendous mountains
I already imagine it
yes and we have the seaside there too, but the problem is the war and the
mhm
and ah the drug trafficking, that has totally damaged that country and the image they have I imagine is horrible
and
yes ah what else, within the United States where would you like to go, or within Canada?
in Canada, ahh I would like to go to Montreal
yes, i had been told that is nice but cold
here where we live now, the winter is only rain
yes
where we lived before, whe winter was a lot of snow and i was super cold
where you live?
near vancouver
and snow falls?
no
impossible
now not cause we're situated near the ocean
you are at the north, never fall snow?
well, falls sometimes but at the next day it gone
yes
and does not freeze?, no, not this
cause here in Los Angeles never falls snow, only on the mountains
and here too, here falls
yes
mmm i don't know, in 3 months or something, stops falling
but should fall because you're at north Betsy
si
yes, you are close to Alaska
yeah but it is, no it is somewhat far because well, it is ehm, on the same level with with the Pacific.
yes close to Seatle, Washington
I see, aha
do you know Seattle, Washington?
I see ehm not so much no
I would like to get to know it around there
I see
yes
hjmm, hjmm
it has beautiful things, museums, history I like everything that has to do with history and and the a classic city is Montreal, Canada
hjmj, it has been two years already
they say that Canada is very beautiful
oh I see ehm if you like the winter, ehm I mean the snow
and no, there is not insecurity like here in the United States
no, at least I have not seen anything so bad
here in the United States it is ugly
yes, you can imagine
it is almost, almost like the Latin countries now
hmjm
yes, that's why they critic here immigration because migration is too much here it is a bad kind of migration
OK
and it has damaged the country a lot
mmh
throughout the years I have seen that this country has really fallen and now in the United States there is a lot of difference between the poor and the rich
mmh
which was not the case before, In Canada I think there is more balance
ehh
there are, there is not so much difference between the poor and the rich in Canada like there is here in the United States
here there is a lot of poor people
but there are more progra-social programs there
but yes, yes that is it
and there are not as many people, the problem here is that there are too many people
mm, m OK
yes, the country has done down unfortunately yes, a lot ahh
two years ago already we went to Florida, Florida
yes and it is dangerous
OK
they  might steal from you, they might do something to you, there is a lot of misery it is almost like a Latin country I don't see the difference anymore
mmh
and you know if the Latin countries are known by the difference between rich and poor
it is true since
and that is this, so the U.S. is becoming
mhm
yes, but there is no interesting things and once I went to Texas and I liked the scenery, I
aha
I've always liked the Colombian plains
super hot
super hot but very nice
yeah
and the plains of Texas are similar, a little more developed and ah I like their steaks
hey yeah
and bought a lot of roasted meat from different places
yeah
is interesting to me would like to know more about Texas
aha
the landscape, the plains most of all, I love the flat plain I like the banker
the horses
and the foreign BBQs
yeah, mhm
I love barbecues, asados as they call them in Colombia
OK
and you find a lot of that in Texas
ah that's great, m
yes, yes I think that one of the more interesting parts of the United States and in Seattle I would like to know because of its coffee, they say there is good coffee there.
you should? that I, I didn't know that, m
yes, yes
well my parents go to El Salvador in November for two months
there are volcanoes there, yes
oh OK OK
yes I remember and there must be beautiful views there
yes yes there are already but again poor people and
there is safety
and almost no work, yes already
yes that is the problem of all Latin countries that that they have never been able to overcome
yes it is true, mhm
yes I hope that one day they can do it
yes one day already
yes yes but and I have heard that the views there are beautiful because there are many volcanoes.
and if I had yes, mm yes there are
and the mountains ? do you know the beaches of Salvador ? how are they ?
yes, they are good and pretty, there is one that's named "the liberty" and it has a lot of swimming pools and the sea, also very large cobs
what are cobs ? surfing boards or what
here, hello wave<???>
because there is the Pacific and the Atlantic too, yes
yes, not only the Pacific, I think it's only the Pacific yes
how many seas does it have ? only the Pacific
the same as here
yes
because Florida is near the Atlantic
Yes
Mhm
because Columbia is near the Atlantic and the Pacific too, Colombia has two seas
Oh
because of that it's a very nice country, it has many beauties and it gets a lot of praieses
mhm, I can imagine, yes
as a country it's the worst but it has a lot of beauty
yes
just as it has many queens
oh and lara and the queen and the coke, eh no<this makes no sense>
but there are many bad things
now it's true
if there are many things, i don't deny, i can't denied the true
now
from a situation, there are bad things
i can imagine
and not only that there is insecurity
mmm
and when you do tourism, you don't want to go a place where you can think that something can happen
mmm, yes its true
really? you don't want to travel to a place where there is so insecurity
mmm
although I'll tell you one thing that its going bury you
What is it?
i never was steal in Colombia
Really?
and i told you how i was rob once in Spain
Really?
Yes Mrs, really
That's odd
They robbed me on, on the subway train
Right.
And they took my wallet
Oh no
And they stole me like, i don't know, a hundred bucks
Wow, and that was in Spain
Yeah, or maybe more, ¿what?, in Spain.
In Spain, not in Colombia.
And in colombia where, where, that it's so famous about that gangster's
aha, OK
thieves it never happened to me because it is one of the reasons that I was always more aware
aha
and in Spain when you are aware
OK, mmh OK it is true OK, mmh
yes yes, and and and also you know that a while ago there was a terrorism act there
in Spain?
yes some trains exploited, they put some bombs and there were people who, it was they were Arab terrorism
aha, oh in Spain, really?
and people died in Spain and this happened in the stations where I was
oh, aha, OK
a few years ago I was in those places where the acts occured
and that happened not long ago?
about a year ago
oh
yes, then well you know, that if something bad is going to happen to you
mmh
something bad is going to happen no no matter where you are
OK that is true, OK, mmh
Good evening I am Joe
Hi, good evening, where are you from?
I am from Colorado
From Colorado. Originally?
From Puerto Rico
Ah, I am, I am in Idaho and am from Chile
From Chile, how nice. How much time did you spend here?
In the US, 10 years, in Idaho 3
10 years, oh, and how do you like it? Do you miss your homeland?
Yes, very much, it's like Colorado, no, Colorado has a lot of snow
And it doesn't change much, this season changes
Clearly
cold to hot or hot to cold?
Clearly, Puerto Rico is like that, true
Today Puerto Rico is, more or less, the same climate all the time, but there when it's rainy and when it's sunny during the year like
July can be pretty hot and May pretty rainy
O, but snow, like
Oh, no never, no
And how much time did you live there?
Oh, I spent many years here, more than 20 years
Oh, a lot. And with, erm, as we talk of travelling, have you been to Puerto Rico?
Actually since, erm, since ninety three when my parents died it was the last time I went to Puerto Rico. But his I've been to other places, I've been to Mexico.
And I've been yes to other places, and places in the US too including Florida which is a
Oh yeah,
one of my favourite places.
So then ah, you haven't always lived in Colorado, you've travelled. Or do you only travel on holidays.
And on holidays to other states, there's a lot to see here. I'm not sure you've had a chance to see other places here in the US.
but there are many nice places
oh, yeah right, not much yet, just Utah, and don't know, Utah and frankly I didn't go to, erm, Washington.
Washington state that's really nice out there
To Washington, of course, but not, not around, around the East side, sure, one day I hope I can, no.
So, how did you end up in Idaho?
Oh, to study.
ah
We moved after I graduated from, from school to, to study here at University.
Right
Ah well, I moved to Utha, and there I met my husband and we're now living in Idaho.
That's good.
But, we've been back to Chile just once five years ago and,
And
We expect to be able to return now, you know, next year maybe
And it's very difficult to be coming and going travelling, due to passports matters and that kind of things
Ah not so much, but I think it's more expensive from Idaho, I think if we were in, Florida, or California, I, Colorado is located in the North, right?
Sure. It's in the middle more or less, we are way down from where you are
In the middle. Ah OK, then like way down, but around the middle
Yes, it's a center point for flights, there are many flights from here to South America too.
a, then it's easier for you to travel.
Yes, for example, if I were going take a vacation in Cancún
Aha
and it were for three days with about three hundred and fifty dollars
Ah, no, seriously
with the hotel and the flight included, yes
Oh, yes, see, that's why we're not going anywere, because only... eh, anything is up of three hundred dollars or so. By passage, it is too expensive
Probably it were easier for you to go to Washington State. Or maybe go to a more centrally situated place and from there fly  to another place if you wanted to
Yes. Did you fly outside America, like to Europe or something like that? Or you didn't have the chance?
No, I'd love to go to Europe, not me, but my brothers, one lives in Wichita, Kansas and the other in Puerto Rico, they travel a lot
A yes.
They went around all Europe and they told me all about what's is like there, Paris, Spain.
Which country would you like to visit if you could?
I'd like, one of my favorites is Autralia
Ah yes, to Australia.
Yes and Australia would be enchanting because its pretty exotic there, so is New Zealand.  But also I'd really like to visit Italy, Spain, France, all those places, but I think that number one for me is Australia.
Yes, Mira, if for me, if I could choose, I think it would be Italy.
Italy, yes, Italy is beautiful.
yes, I don't know, Italy, yes, I think Italy.  But Australia, is enormous, Australia, there's so much to do.
There's lots of history.  Yes, well I worked for a company where the president of the company is Australian, and the owner of the company too, so  we developed a good friendship and all that.
And he was always inviting me to go there, but I had a five year-old daughter, I'm a single father.
oh,
And I had joint custody,
and you--of course.
so
oh, so you're going to be,
I would never abandon her, never leave her behind.
of course.  At least for another five years, no.
yes, yes, when she forgets she's got a dad, and and begins to think more about boyfriends, yes
Of course when she wants nothing more to do with you, for a while, no
yes yes but until now, well I'm crazy about her and she's crazy about me and,
of course, no, now it's hard
we get along so well.
Yes, we have little kids, too and that makes it so difficult to be able to travel anywhere.
yes exactly.  Well I want to go to Puerto Rico next year so she can meet her Puerto Rican half, beause her mother is Mexican,
Or course ah.
then I want that she knows this, and she is crazy about going and to see her grandmother.  That her grandmother comes here every year and they get along so well, they have good chemistry the two of them,
ah, then you are going to take her there, but at about what age are you thinking of taking her,
her, well, she has traveled so many times by plane,
aha
ah, traveled more than I in the last three years because she goes to Mexico with her mother, at least twice a year.
Look, then she is constantly
Oh, she is very used to travelling, she is very calm, but I tell you that the first time we traveled.  Well it wasn't, it wasn't by plane, but when I take a trip to Wichita
Mmh
I took one of those Greyhound and it was a terrible experience, because she was very small still.  And when she got on the bus,
Of course.
She was asleep, but when she woke up completely she panicked.
I imag-
I think that she thought that she had one of the worst nightmares.  And people there well she was very uncomfortable, and they told me things.
Of course
And the trip was very bad, but,
Oh, I imag- how old was she?
she was like two years old there.
Oh, tiny, she doesn't understand yet, of course.
yes i promised to her that i was never let to get her in a bus we called guagua
OK
so the next time we went in an airplane a little airplane and we spend it very good she was very happy and without mention that in just
a trip hour, compare to the thirteen hours when we get the bus
yes that's too much
yes
no but well the people that like because she is going to travel after, because there are people that dislike to travel and i cant believe that
was horrible
that they don't like to travel
i would loved to see everything in the planet if i could
true
because i would like to travel as much as i can but in reality the economics and the situation make it very hard
sure you have to be responsable here because we have children
yes exactly
we have to put our feet in the earth for awhile
yes exactly but i have an opportunity to go to another  places go to Colorado because its very pretty
i heard about that its super slow
its beutiful you come here
many forest no
you have many national forest, you have majestic mountains, you have atractive places in the city too, you have many other things, you have a little of everything, but you are going here in the mountains and go to fabolous places the beauty is like you were in the paradise
And how many years have you lived in Colorado
I have spent 26 years living here
Wow
In December I will be 26, yes. Well, yes, little rights came, I stopped for some time in New York for a short time
Mhm
So I came here with my first ex-wife
Mhm
So we were married about 10 years, and then we both chose sides
And she was American, or, where was she from?
But she is half Puerto Rican and half Swiss
Ah
She was my high school sweetheart
Oh yes
Yes, well, we were carrying on well, and we ended well but we realized that we had different goals in the end
Clearly, well, people change a lot, no
Change a lot, yes yes
In those years
The mother of the daughter, well it was a very short matrimony
Clearly
It barely lasted two years
Oh, yeah, oh, and she, she's from Mexico
Yeah, she's from Oaxaca, Mexico.
Right
But we have a good relationship with the girl's parents. We work very closely to her. In fact, today we went to her kindergarten's school
Um
So, to see what the teacher had to tell us, and the teacher gave a, a good report on the girl, because she's a very good girl, she has a good heart and
she has such a sweet voice everybody likes
That's odd, yeah, it's very sweet.
She has, she's very well behaved, she's very respectful, she's, uh, she loves God very much and she has, you know, good principles and she's very hungry for learning
¿Where does she live now?
In, ¿my ex wife you mean?
Yeah, with the girl
She lives very close to here, i live in Aurora, Colorado, and she lives like three miles from here.
Oh, so you can see her often.
Yes, i see her three times a week every week. More on other activities like, well, today for example.
Oh, look, that's cool
We share together withher
Oh, look how good
Yeah, that's good
And it's going to be pretty, now when, if you're from Puerto Rico, you don't have trouble going in and out of the United States, right?
nope not at all.
I've never understood that, what does the united states have to do with Puerto ricans, its a separate country but at the same time
well, it was invaded by americans, in 1898.
ha
they took it from the Spanish people, so they stayed, and then they started putting Puerto Rican governments.
like in 1954, they gave all of the Puerto Ricans the citizenship.
oh, not so long ago.
but Puerto rico, for example when my parents were born, they weren't citizens, but I've been a citizen my whole life.
of course
so then the free state, arose, which is a free association of the united states.
they vote for primary presidents here. but not for presidential elections.
so its kind of independent, somehow it has,
oh
a dependece with the united states of american, would be very hard, Puerto rico is an independent country because,
independent.
they would have to approve it over there first, they've never approved it, and they wont
Good evening, Mildred from Connecticut.
Hi, ¿How are you?, ¿What's your name?
Mildred.
Mildred, this is Arturo
¿Where are you from Arturo?
Um, I'm from Mexico, but i'm now in Philadelphia.
Oh, ok, we have spoken before, have we?
May be.
I'm sorry.
I think so, i don't... ¿where are you from, Puerto Rico?
Yes
Yeah, I've spoken with you.
Puerto Rican, uh um.
I was talking about, i don't remember what, but i remember that now it's about music.
Today it's about music.
Yeah, it's very good music, ¿isn't it?
¿Do you like it?
A lot.
Uh um.
¿Do you play an instrument or?
What type of music do you listen to?
Well of everything, ehm, music, ehm, jazz, a little of classical music since I also listen a lot to like I don't know ehm contemporary music, such a alternative and like fusions like that like
fusion of jazz with funk
Rock and all of that, ahm,
little of everything what do you listen to
reggaeton and all of that
no, do you like reggaeton?
oh,
Do you like reggaeton?
yes I yes, I listen of everything.  Reggaeton, Rap of everything
yes aha
Rock, I don't lik- me I listen but I don't like it for, for a long time fora little while OK But like a whole night liztening rock, no
I am not much of a rocker
no I yes I am very much a rocker
But yes the bachata, merengue, salsa, everything that is music, classical music
yes
Romantic music, beautiful, yes, I find that yes the music makes the countries be known, it makes the people in different countries to be known
yes, yes, but
And
lately I think that that has been lost as well because like the music now it is now becoming so mainsteam like for example hip hop that now, that is everybody is making that usic the same way.
in the United State, in Mexico, in all wave, are imitating and are just taking like one or rather, it has become a global common.
Everyone, listens to them, I think so, I do not like them, really, but is very impressive how everyone is adopting the hip hop
inside the his/her music, I think is like the regueton is also doing much also.
yeah, yeah,
in Mexico, also the Mexican music is using a lot of hip hop, there are more like rock bands that use hip hop or something like that
I believe that yes, that it unites many people. Even though they are from different nationalities. There are people that are from Mexico that like salsa, there are people that are
yes
from other countries that like salsa, the merengue, yes, yes, the bachata, when you go to dance, well
yes, yes
there
yes I like to dance merengue and also salsa
there are many countries dancing
yes
I also like Mexican music because it has a good rythm especially the rancheras, I love it, yes
yes, the rancheras
I like them a lot
yes, they are very good, yes me too, but I don't know how sometimes is, this is interesting to learn about music from other countries, like
oh, have you ever heard Arabian or Turkish music
yes, yeah
interesting, no, is good also
Yes, really nice, really nice, and Chinese also, Chinese music
yes, yes
yes, especially, you know, if I could play it it would be nicer because they almost every time present a story during presentations, women are always moving their hands
yes, and the fans
yes, yes
They use then like to narrate a story
Oh, well, everyone tells a story with music, i mean, in everyone music without lyrics is also telling, it's painting like a picture or image, it's like
an stage. if it has lyrics, well, it's always related with a feeling or a story. Mexican music like the "corridos"
they are very well known, well, because they tell stories, to so different from the ones you have lived, but the stories are real;y remarkable, and good sometimes
Yes, like the older times, when natives made their
yes
dancing, and the slaves were the first to use music as a protest
yes
how bad they were, they expressed all their
Oh
their dissatisfaction
yes, yes
I think music will always be there, centuries will come and it will be always be here
Of course
even if it is different, the gay the choose, it will make people closer, everywhere you go, you listen to reggaeton, and you know who is, ans sometimes
yes ha
I do not know if you remember there was a Japanese band named the Band of Light
aha
they started playing salsa
no, not if
yes, the Japanese were here a long time and have not done much lately but played a big part in New York, they did not have their original discs, but they did play the
the discs themselves were doing them in Japanese and salsa music
Oh Japanese
I'm sure if a Japanese came here to America, oh I was saying, because you've heard this song
no, I've never heard it
I do not understand what he said, but
clearly
mhm and I think it's beautiful and relaxing music
yes, yes, me too
one uses it to relax
very relaxing to distract
and I have a disc from Puerto Rico with music that recorded from the sounds of the river
ah,
For relaxing, for one
yes
when one wants to go home and be relaxed you can put your candles on that color, it will help you relax
ha like lots of environmental sounds that are,
mhm yeah and we need music, we are missing music because its the best in music, people would be like
a little bit more aggressive as well.
yeah, its just that music is
because music relaxes you
music that is um, violent helps you feel better, right, music is also important for the liberation of something like
there's a singer, his name is 'hay music afrobid' his name is cela kuti, and this man well, he stops the civil war in nigeria.
it was important because with his music, he made the movements of revolution, i mean people didn't see him as a musician but as a political leader.
ha
what, and following his music, moved people, so he kept making new discs.
um
the military sometimes got mad, he had a complete community of practice men like him, that had his same political philosophy.
and everyone lived together in communities, and then he took a disc that was called zombi which criticized the army, because they were like the governments puppets.
for killing people of their same race.
oh
he said all of this in his songs, and the military people would hear it.
almost always, they would start throwing them out.
yeah yeah, they were throwing him out, they hit him and burned him and put down his house,
because they called it protest music. really
exactly, music
in Puerto Rico they had the Mole, the Mole, and who was that guy who sang protest music? Juan Manuel Serrat sang protest music, and sometimes when he gave concerts, they wouldn't let them, you know
yeah, sure
because they sang the truth of the people
yes, yes
against the government and all that, they, they
people got really agitated and the government doesn't like that
they tried to boycott the concerts so people wouldn't go
yes
but it's interesting because that tells a story
yes, that gets marked in history too, music will always reflect what people are living in a certain moment, and what they think
yes, I think the same, I think that
yes, nice
As I, as I tell you, I think music is really necessary
yes, always
It tells love stories, it tells sad stories, it tells the problems of the people
yes
daily life is used for a lot of things
yes, yes, I think it's essential, just as essential as air, I think we couldn't live without
Yes, I think that, I love music. I think that when I play music, I clean my house faster
Yeah, and do you play any music?, do you play any instrument?
No, you see, i always liked the piano, and my kids took a piano class, but i never had the chance that my mother would have had the money to pay for my classes of
Yeah
I like the guitar and the harp very much
Oh, the harp
The harp, that's a, a not very common instrument, but find it's music beautiful
Yeah, not so much, in fact i had a friend in school, who played the harp, very beautiful, right
Yeah, the harp is very nice. You know what i like too, i also love accordion music.
Yeah, but yeah, like you said, well in Mexican music they use accordion a lot.
Yeah, right, they use it in Puerto Rico, the people from, what, what we call gicaro, country music. During holiday parties and all that, they use it then.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But you don't play any instrument.
Yeah, i play, uh, the guitar, the bass, and well i tried piano for a while, but it was very hard, i, i couldn't.
Well, i just stayed with
My boyfriend plays, my boyfriend plays the bass. He played too, because he doesn't anymore, not now that he's older.
Right.
But
yes
He played with bands and orchestras, and he played the piano.
It's always good to play music, i think.
mhm
also serves to vent a while when I want something as distracting or my bass and play a while, and
and it's relaxing
I get distracted, if I relax
and that's good
yes
that is good, I need it very much
mhm
because it ~DJ~
ah
it's on so, there is music throughout the house
ah, okay
and each is put on the internet passes recorders, and
yes
and we make discs to people if they want
aha
Sometimes we have parties and we do it is that recording a complete disc of songs and gave it to the person
yes
aha
a parent if my uncle does something very similar also the, this is the, well it was like
aha
But now, he does not work much on that, now he really is with other job, but, but also records.
good night, I'm Joe
good night, Cristina, from Idaho
How are you Cristina?
Fine, Where you from?
I'm from Puerto Rico, but i live here in Denver, Colorado
Ah, how long?
Oh, I have a very long time, like twenty-six years living here
Oh
Yes, and you?
i have ten years
ten years, where you from?
from Chile
Had i spoken with you the other night?
I think, the voice sounds familiar
Yes, i think so.
Yes, you have a daughter?
Yes, a girl of five years old
Ah, yes, i remember, How is your daughter
good good, growing, getting very cute, and sweet
you have to be careful with the kids
Oh yes. Really already ao small she tells me whe- she asks me when she can have a boyfriend. I tell her, a lot of time is going to pass sweetie before that is possible.
Like at twenty five years old no
yes, more or less. It could be.
And sin-
What, what talking about the topic this night,
yes How is colo, how is it where you live? In, is it a big city, or do you live in the city, or do you live outside?
Well Denver is a city that's considered as big, but uh, we-
Ah
I live in Aurora which is at the side of Denver
Uh huh
it's a city also, and it's plenty populated, but it doesn't have the tall buildings of Denver
Ah, and a little more quiet
I wouldn't say that it's quieter, I would say that
Ah
because, it has such a mix of everything,
Hm mm
of good people, of bad people, of all ethnic groups, there's, crime is pretty high here, and one lives with what appears to be a little fear.
Hm mm
So, yes, before I lived in a house. Now I live in an apartment, and, and, I've found various bad situations around here.
Oh yes?
including gunfire and things like that.
Ah and, would you like to move, where would you like, what type of place would you like to live in?
Well yes if I could leave, well I would go to a more peaceful place, a a small town.  Rather than a city,
Ah
because I am rather tired of the city.  In fact in the, I drive here every day, and traffic in Denver is horrible.
It must be.
Too many cars, too many, and and where I take my daughter to, to eh, where she goes to school, well it takes me a lot of time, sometimes I am like an hour and a half in the morning driving, before going to work.
Wow
yes, it is a little, when one arrives to work, one is already stressed.
A headache, no.
And with a headache, yes
What a difference man.  Here it is very calm
yes
Super super quiet. Eh.
What, it's a small town?
It is, well, Idaho actually, the state of Idaho is rather, eh, country I would say.
Yes
I mean the biggest city is Boise
yes, around there yes
but it is a quiet city.  And, and it is rather a small city.
yes
And this is the largest city. The next following that I would say is Idaho Falls, but I consider that is like a large town.
yes
But it's not a city, city, but it's, since there are no large buildings or things like that, or even buildings really.
yes
But then, ah, there are, it's like for what is there, it is a large town. But mm
And how is crime and things like that?
Oh, nothing happens. People live leaving their doors open, their cars unlocked.
Ah, how awesome.
And
Ah, it's not like that in Aurora.
Of course, it's very tranquil. I mean, here the daily news, ah, talks about, ah, someone has lost something. I mean news, no, nothing, nothing happens, yes.
If something were to happen it would be the news
No crimes or anything like that.
Of course, over months, no, nothing, absolutely nothing
Wow. What, what a wonderful thing.
At times too quiet
Well, I'm heading there, then, to become your neighbor.
Yes, it's very tranquil. And people, many people live in the country. So they live, it's, it's tranquil, super super tranquil
That's completely the opposite of Denver
Ehm, yes
And Aurora, Aurora
Like I say, it is too much, too much quiet.  There is, and there is ot much to do, I mean, over here the people that live here, they like a lot doing things outside, like
yes
camping, go fishing, and go to the mountains to ski, and
No, the people in Colorado too. Uhm, hm, uhm, here n- hm, we like going to the mountains a lot, camping, and all of that
Of course, since
but here there is people from everywhere, and
Of course
many places that a- that that those people have come from, have brought many bad habits too
Of course
So, well things happen that one, one lives with fear
Sure
with my daughter I always live with fear, because there is a lot they always talk about in the news that there is a crime in Aurora
Sure
That yes, the shots, that yes sole that, that yes ran a child over, and the, car driver hit and ru
Sure
Things like that
Like a cit-  like a city city, well,
Pardon?
We lived in, when i lived in Chile i lived in Santiago for a while which is the capitol.
yes
And of course, living in a city is different. I mean you can't leave open doors, you can't trust anybody generally. And
And in the cars, people leave CDs inside vehicles
Of course
None of that because they will brake the windows so they can steal
everything
the CDs and
everywhere, or
I don't ever leave anything in the car that would bring attention to it.
Of course, around here is very quiet. Too quiet for me, but is OK cause I have kids, so its good to raise them and all that.
Ah that's good. I dream of a place like that, only thing is
That't why
I am a divorced father, my daughter
of course
we have, I mean my ex-wife and I share custody
You must be close to
Yes, I'd never want to leave my daughter behind, I want to stay here until she grows up,
Of course
And she said once, 'I'll get married once and I'll forget about you'. I hope not but I know that happens sometimes.
A lot of good happens
yes
But, nothing I like yes, I live in a very peaceful situation. My brother lives in Kansas.
I see
and it is very peaceful out there as well
I don't understand
The have festivals and the people are very peaceful.
A little more relaxed
yes, here there are many pretty things. Not everything here is, nothing is ugly, none of this but
I see
it is  because there are so many people living here and more moving here and is the city or the cities in Colorado growing the most in America
I see
En-Eh, this also causes you problems.
yes and this is why I'm strange. Because here there isn't much to do. Aside from outdoor things, here there is no opera or a place for
the mall is very small, there are no places to go visit, or places for ballet or concerts and things like that. These things are not here.
Well it's just another city, you know how they say or the city in Utah.
yes
and, and If you like to do things like go to concerts or go to you know an opera or theater o whatever thing like a show
no there are not I have to drive four hours or three hours to go do something. Here there is not much to do. What's unique is that there university that is here has these small shows and things but
that is missing from the city
yes
that you can find this type of entertainment but, at the same time is
No, here is the opposite. Here you have the
uh, with the peacefulness and all that. That, I liked a lot, when we lived in Utah
yes
oh, in City, is like a city that has everything that you could want
yes
is very peaceful
And the, well the, in many parts from here is very peaceful. And there you can find all kinds of family attractions
Of course
for adults, for singles, everything. If fact, it has many things in facts, where I work, it's a area where there are a lot high tech companies from
yeah
so then, also, even an amphitheatre is abut a block away from where I work, and sometimes we can hear the concerts from where we work at
Of course
of the building
you see that, I like to be close to something like that, that could have more activities and things like that
yes, or no, we miss that here, the activities. The only thing that sometimes, the, especially in the city in which I live in, there is a lot of crime there. I would like
there are other places from, from here also, there are areas which are very peaceful and
hm
and good neighborhood. Even though there is a lot of people, but they take care of each other. And, and like you said, they have their cars open, and are not worried that something will get stolen, nothing like that
Of course
In this, that is, like a limit of, it's a mix of good and bad.
Right.
You understand, and the big bad guys, well, they're the ones that like to take advantage
Right
And, well, you live in fear and, quiet.
Right.
But let me tell you, the traffic is horrible.
That i really don't miss.
It's, it's really horrible. Because sometimes, the cab drivers, and during winter days it's even worse. Because when there starts to happen all these accidents and you can't move on the highway
Oh, the snow, the ice and all that. Oh
it's terrible.
Oh, yeah, i don't miss that at all.
But i always dream about a quiet place like that. Some day i think that, i mean, i will be possible. In, in
Well, yeah, well, when you, uh, when you, and, ¿where does your daughter live now?, she lives near too, ¿right?
She lives very near. Like one, not even two miles away from here.
Oh
In what was my house, um. And also the house of my wife, they got in too. Once they got in through the
the, because the house has three levels
Right
and the basement, it is not like a basement, windows were up
yes
Then, they broke from the back side and the basement, downstairs and they robbed a lot of things there
Oh, and they weren't home, or were they?
No, she has left to work. I went home, check it out and I recommended her to block this and that, for
not letting so easy for the bad guys, right?
Of course
Then she did it, and also in her car. At work, where she parks her car, well they have broke in her car like three time
Oh, that;s bad
Three times they have brake their windows, they have taken the CD the Stereo
That's really bad
Yeah, those are the bad things about living in the city. You have good things but there is also a lot of
Of course, you have to
disadvantages
You have to be careful
I miss it
Here you can relax. And that's a problem, because we are missing the people from outside, they take advantage of these things. People trust too much
Exactly
They relax and all
Hey, you have
and, a-
sorry, go on.
oh, for example when that happened, it was big in the news here that the man came and killed a family and took the kids.
Oh, I remember that.
yes, a- because they live right here in the town and the kids, no one ever imagines that someone like that would come to these parts, and
yes
and
yes, the crime could happen anywhere.
clearly.
That's the sad thing, that someone
And one has to be careful, always.
and, not trust certain people, especially strangers.
Clearly, and
I, I always teach my little girl that she should not trust strangers and to be very careful.
yes, but you understand that when someone has kids, they start to have all of these worries, ah, its terrible.
yes and one starts to teach them that no one should touch them here or there and
Clearly, when someone doesn't have kids they only have to worry about themselves. But
yes
and now having kids, and no
Hello, good afternoon.
Hello? Good afternoon. What?
Maira speaking
Ah, Maira, ah, how are you? This is Jose.
Memo Are you Memo?
Allo? Um?
Who are you?
This is Jose?
Ah, again?
yes, again
How are you
Fine, and you?
Very well How is everything? How are the classes going?
Fine. Studying, a little bit and, they called me and I said, well why not, why not take a break, right?
Fine
And How are you? How are your classes going?
Me? Fine.All quiet, the exams are over, therefore I am in that week in which, nothing else, nothing else can be done.
Uhum, uhum.
And, well fine, nothing else with the weather. I don't get accustomed.Makes me feel sick
Ah, no.
I swear that in the morning i turn around and i get, i get mad, oh, again.
No, but, but, ¿where are you from?, or, ¿where do you live?
Oh, I'm at the high-rises, right.
Uh, ¿before you came here?
Yes. ¿Where?
¿Oh, before i came here to study?
No, no, no. I lived, before coming here, i lived in, i lived in Singapore for two years. And before that in Mexico City, my whole life.
Oh, so that's it.
Yes.
Yes. it's very hot. Oh, it's hotter than here
Yeah, sure. I am accustomed to the tropic.
It's very hot in Singapore, right?
Then, you're tropic, like that, no, nothing else, then.
Yes.
Yes, i got here and that's how today, today, ¿what's going on?
Oh, and then here, uh, yes, it's cold and
Yes.
Uh
And the air, raining for a week, i don't understand how can you survive this time.
No, it's cold, and yes, there's no sun. Oh, yes, well, i don't know, after the summer it feels good. But, a, a, on a week like this, with a little cold and
like that, uh, ah, not much, like that. I like it but ah, yes, you know that it's just the beginning, right? of a terrible winter.
yes.
So, ouch, but that, that's what I don't like, but
yes, yes, yes. And what happens is that the cold, yes, you can bear it, like that supposed until December, Christmas is gone and then when, what happens is that
when you return, you think yeah, well, Christmas is gone. Well, you say, already already the cold is over.
Uhum.
The cold is for Christmas and already and you return and it's worse. That's when it hits me, and I'm left like oh no
Ah.
enough, enough please.
yes, I know, it's like my, my brother that studies in, in, in Cornell. That it's like much more to the North, it must be like six hours from Philadelphia, but it's
much more to the North
yes.
and there is such a cold there that they don't even start classes until, until the end of January, until the twenty eighth of January or
Come on!, really?
yes, yes, because, well, he says that over there it's so cold that in order that, me, we better spend some more days in May than spend some days here in January, right? the students. Because, it's that
Come on!, aha
they are, it's that, the cold in Cornell is brutal, the on in Philadelphia, at least one can bear it, right? The one in Cornell is, is too much.
Oh, you just can't.
And my brother.
And I was thinking of going there. It's good I didn't go, because I would not have survived. I swear to you that I wouldn't have survived.
It is true, is is not that and my brother, uhm well, he was lucky to, to had been given a, what they call a townhouse.
Aha.
but that, that it was much larger, then one would come in and they had a first small living room downstairs and kitchen, and then one would go up and over there were all all the other roos
it was rather large, but the problem is that they were some of the new university dorms
Oh.
and they had built it in in the, in a, in the outskirts of, of the university, then it was to a far side of the university.  And his classes
were of engineering that they were in the other side of the university
Today, poor guy
And, and he would say that that and too he is ah, is that I Say no, really?  Then I would tell him but Tell him has, there is, there is a bus system there of, of
of public transport there, why don't yo use it?  No is that I don't want to pay the fifty dollars do you understand
Oh.
true so in the end, he spent the whole semester walking and And in the winter, there was, I don't know twenty degrees and h- he would walk forty minutes to get to class, is that
oh, is that my brother
Today, poor guy
No, no is that it is
He asked for it.
But it is because no, no that yes, is that he is cheap, right? he did not want to pay the fifty dollars then he would say yes, me, is that that is ridiculous then he would say
no because the bus only passes one time every four times each hour, then he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes is that a thing like that.
Oh.
Ah, is that my brother, I don't know
What year is your brother in?
No, but um, now he is in third year.
Ah, OK.
yes, yes, but
It is well.
and, and what do you think about, about crime here in Philadelph-?
About what? About crime?
Eh, about crime, yes.
Here in Philly I have not heard much I mean, I hear that there are some people who are robbed on forty-first and one or whatever,
Uhum.
but I believe that I always have had good luck because I have been working at night alone on forty-first and I like going to the store
to the fruit store on forty-eighth and when I want I go there and nothing has ever happened.
And you walk all the way to forty-eighth?
yes.  By myself, too.  I comfortable, in addition I mean, don't believe I pay attention I'm not scared or anything,
Oh.
and nothing has ever happened or have I had reason to, to be scared or anything on the contrary, everybody is really nice when I get there.
The, I don't know, I think that
yes, yes.
I think that I am lucky because in Mexico it is the same thing.  I mean, all my friends in Mexico have a story of being robbed or kidnapped or something has been done to them.
And nothing has ever happened to me, I always go alone at bad times of night in bad places, like that, and like that all the things they tell you you shouldn't do
Uhum, uhum.
I've done all this and still nothing has happened to me.
Oh really?
Yes, yes I promise you it's just like that. I see what I've done and I remember what I've done y how did I dare do it?
What were you thinking? You were an irresponsible teenager, but...well, nothing like that's ever happened to me.
Eh.
So, I don't know. No, I don't necessarily feel that it's unsafe because I don't have many reasons to feel that way. But you? You know Philly.
Mmm, yeah. I don't know Philly but it does know me.
Ah, yes. What's up?
For me it's like, eh...with me it's almost like the same story, right? Because for me nothing has ever happened here, so...but of course, I am alive.
Here, near to the university, I live in Walnut. 38 between...between 38 and 39.
Oh.
So, it's not very far and here there is a lot of security so mostly I don't know anyone, I don't do anything, and really I think that...
Of course it's occurred to you, right? To return it, you've seen in a magazine...
Yes.
But in general it's really weird because en this area there is so much security and they have cameras.
Yeah, they do have both.
And lights, and they have those phones, and they have people around...the police on bikes that are just incredible, they have...
And it costs more money, but also-- it's like in general, they keep it safer.
Yes, yes it is very safe here.
And, and I imagine that, that, that the people from the hood, for example or, or the criminals, right? I know that, that over here there's so much security that they have to be careful eh.
And I think that it's been enough times ah mm they can to the, to the ones that do crimes, then I don't know, in general it's secure enough and now
in the, in the Quad they have those, well because before it was , the security no no, it wasn't, it wasn't so strict, because you had to pass through there and you gave the card to a person
and then they passed through the, through the, how's that called? e-, the system, to see if you really were a student and it wasn't
that it wasn't counterfeited eh, the card, and then you passed, right? But now
~O~K.
but the thing is that people went out and it was easy to get in. But now they those systems that e-, those new doors that, that
that you can't do anything, right? Then in general, they worry too much to one on the university
yes.
eh, e-
yes, in general my - ah, in Philadelphia like there are some places that I don't dare go.
yes.
I don't like it, you know, at night at the Center City there's some places I don't like to walk by.
No, e-
But I don't know, maybe because I don't know the city well, I believe I don't know I know people from here.
yes.
That is, in Mexico it happens that if I see someone and I know I don't get close and I cross the street or not.
Uhum.
And here is like that like I don't know, don't know and who I'm scared off and who I doesn't.
yes, yes.
Well no, no, no.
Well Philadelphia has many neighborhoods that aren't even because
yes.
uh-, uh, they have, they're, they're and the neighborhood is plenty secure, right? so one has here, from the university which is also in general very secure but
say-, say if one goes to, to the to the north, like in North Philly and all of that and South Philly and West Philly and well it's not necessary but more
I mean only that gets very, very dangerous. So, but also to-, for example if one is going to go out at night they're not go to North Philly to go out, then it's not so
to important, right?
Uhum.
for well, for us.
yes, also.
yes, because if, if one is going to go out, if one goes to Philadelphia, but if one goes to Old City but then in Old City there is so much people that go out that they have police and everything
so then
Hey, but little then you don't know anyone from Philly that has a history of a-, of them being robbed of something.
yes, uh, yes, in general, well also there aren't many students that that go to Old City in general the students are, they stay here at, at the university.
Uhum. ~O ~K.
It seems to me. Uh. yes, well in general. But the people complain to much that there is that there isn't security here that we're in a bad neighborhood and
but in general it's, it's that that if, if every week one reads the, the, the ~D ~P then there's, there's uh, once that
that there was an, an assault of whatever, then one goes, one naturally thinks that that it's, that it's occurring a lot, right? but
Uhum.
in, in reality it's a-, one thinks well perhaps they assault, or rob I don't know two hundred students, but since there are twenty thousand students, and then the probability that the
that, that happens to one
yes, too.
of course it exists, ¿right?, but it's not so, so high.
Of course, and they're also in a lot and is also a lot rare for it to happen to you if you're walking alone or in
yes, yes
the forty and three, that's how it always happensa, therefore, if they cannot do that either, right?.
Yes, yes, yes, but that also, i think that is better to live like in, something like high-rises of college because not, specially if you go back there in, at, at night and
yes, it's very quiet.
it's just, it's, uh, yes, well it's nice to have
Don't worry about anything
than walking a long time, people who live like that in Baltimore, but the blocks on Baltimore are huge, there they have to
yes. And there's no light.
yeah, huge. ¿Um?
And no light.
There's no, there's no light.
On the blocks.
yes, there's no light, yes. And, but in high-rises it's better, it's quiet, you don't have to buy all the uh, furniture.
Uh um.
uh, if something happens, you call college and they take care of it
yes.
but and, and you have to, that also there are many I have heard many stories of the problems between people who, who share an apartment
Hello.
Hello, Whom am I speaking to?
Hello,I'm Olaya, in Philadelphia.
Olay- I'm Arturo.
Are you Spanish?
Eh, no, I'm from Mexico.
Ah, okay, very good, nice to meet you. And where are you calling from?
From Philadelphia also, in fact, yes.
Also, Good.
What do you do in Philadelphia, do you work or study?
now I'm studying
Ah, okay.
in, in UPenn, the university.
Oh, me too.
Yes, what do you do?
yes, Chemical engineering, undergraduate.
Aha.
And you?
I'm in the linguistic program.
Ah, okay, Do you have anything to do with this program?
No, i mean, i know people that take it, i know the LDC and what they do.
oh okay
but no
and, i mean, what is the end result of making this program, what is it for
well, the LDC collects lots of data, in text, oral, etc then you can use it for lots of things, for example.
oh
oh, programs, that can be understand the voice,  they need an entertainment, they don't need
oh okay, OK
a demo, lets say
okay okay
so then, mm for example, for that and for studies like that people pronounce a word, how to say it i don't know, for what i mean,
ha wow
for lots of things, and then LDC makes that, they collect data in different languages, and then the people
ha
can make more things, more practice, or for studies, more theory, right?
more specialized.
mhm yes yes
wow okay, so then, where do you live in philadelphia, what neighborhood?
well, i live in west philly, but not too much to the west, i live on the 43 in spruce.
oh okay okay, so its not too much to the west. like you say
No, not too West
yes, yes, I live on Campus.
And, aha, aha
But, I live all the way up, on fortieth,
Mmh
In the high rises.
Mmh.  Mmh.
And, how, who do you feel the environment is there, living around forty-third?
Well, to me, the truth is that I like it a lot.  I mean, I, before coming, am
yes?
they told me, well, and I read that Philadelphia was dangerous and such, and
yes.
careful with West Philly, even in, in according to the guides, take ca- that it is dangerous to go to campus, at night
Aha.
And, I, well, I take, this is my second year yere.
Mmh.
and, am, I, the truth, is that I've never seen anything, or anything has ever happened to me, nor do I feel unsafe, in general.  I mean, maybe it is because,
I don't know, because I look little, either, I don't look to the news much, that scare a bit.
yes, that too.
And, and I don't know, Nothing has ever happened to me, and no, and I don't feel, I don't feel in danger, nor do I feel it is dangerous.  But well, I know people, people who really, yes, no? they, they are really scared of West Philly, and
yes, people, black people, no? it is like many people get intimidated by the black people here.
yes, but, well, mm,
E- to me,
that is your- that is your problem. is not? I mean, I don't know.
Yes, sure. No, But what, I mean, like, many people relate to West Philly, with like, so, the neighborhood like the ghetto, no? like
Mhm, mhm.
The neighborhood of black people, and like, insecure
yes, Mhm, mm, yes, that is
But,
I mean, tell me, tell me.
I mean, I, I don't feel so intimidated either not at all because I have a friend that lives in the forty five,
Mhm.
and, and I walk to go there very frequently. And, and also at night, and all
Mhm, mhm.
and eh, and I also find many people, there, sometimes, at night, because I have to walk across the, the, eh, the park,
yes.
and, eh, and there are many people, there is also, eh, at night, in this way, at two at the morning there are partying, and so, eh
I have never received a threat, not, I mean, They never do more that asking me for a cigarette or something like that, and that is.
Mhm, mhm, mhm.
No, I mean, in, really don't don't see that they are promoting, there, like
Not, let´s see, it is true that things happen, I do, I do know a girl that was, was robbed, right?
Ah, OK
And, but, those things happen in all the cities, I don´t know.
Yes. All. yes, yes, yes.
And, in every city there is, there is crime and, and I don´t know, but I think here is,
yes, aha
there is given too much relevance, it happens too much, right? and, it is shown on the TV, and in the newspaper, and then, then, at last is like a collective state of mind,
yes, yes.
psychosis. Right?
yes, I think is like, you say, like they are overreacting. Then, the people by themselves
yes.
like the idea that is very unsafe. But, really don´t, not so much. Whatever, is like the idealization, like they were thinking about it,
Hmm,hmm.
they are making it worst than it really is.
Hmm. And, West Philly, I don´t know, it looks to me as a suburb, with not so beautiful areas, but it has some beautiful areas and, and very nice to walk by.
yes, yes.
And, I don´t know, there is people who live in Center City  that would never think about coming here for a walk, right?.
of course not.
And , I don´t know, it looks to me like a very nice neighborhood, it is the true.
yes, I don´t, I don´t dislike it.
mhm
in other words, is not only singular, or particular nice, not even but, but, then,in other words, is, like you said,they have beautiful places to walk a while and,
and then, also, I said, like living in here as a college guy, then, this, then, whole world in living in here then, at the same time, how,then, no don't even want to be very far from here, because is very disconnected from the people and the university, then,
yes, yes, yes, mm .
also, I believe,
Yes
that is why we have this accommodation to those whom live in the university
mm. I, at a time, I went for a walk until 70th street, or something like that, I start to move on, and i went
to, yeah?
I wanted to see what was there, and.
and what did you found?
and then, I had found a Norman place, and poor place, in other words, ugly house can be seen or few houses looked very old, or bad, not taking care of. in other words,see
haha
poor places could be seen in certain places.
Yes
but, but I haven't seen anything unpleasant, or something that could be scary, I don't know, is like, you could see it,
yes. No?
but but, the earnings of that places was but, lower than others.no?
they earn way less, yeah.
and, of course, also I was surprised not to see a white person on the place, that also
yes, yes, yes.
those are the things that have surprised me the most about Philadelphia, no? The, the big division there still is.
yes, the displacement is striking. You know.
yes, .Mhm.
You know, it's striking to see that, like the more to the west you go, the more black people there is, and less and less whites.
Mhm, ,h,. yes, really, and sometimes it's curious, mm, I, mm, ah, I take the bus here, here in front of my house, and sometimes, when I get inside the bus, everyone is black, and the, the bus, starts like changing color, you know, the more it proceeds,
yes, yes, yes.
That it goes- that it goes to the east, and when you go west, the other way around, that's a thing.
yes, yes, yes. Yes it's true, I have used the bus just one time. But, but I remember, also, getting up. And, then, then notice that
everybody was black when you went to the eas- to the west.
yes, yes, yes. It's curious.
yes, but, well, that's, that's also, well, it's like it's a consequence of you know, the fact that the majority of, of the people here are black, well, is, is of the lowest income. Then, well,
Of course, of course. It's a relationship with the social class, No? more, more than something racial, that's clear, yes.
Of course. yes, more than anything. It's only that. But,
Where are you from from M- from Mexico?
from the city. From Mexico City
They say it's dangerous, No? O, what it
yes, yes, there, there is much more serious the the, you know, the matter. You know, it's not like here at all, that, that, you know, you know, there is seriously,
mhm.
and specially, there still is a lot of separation, you know, of, of social classes. And, it's evident, you know, is,
Oh.
I'm like, I have something like a, a look more like, european, lets say. I'm white, my skin is white and my eyes bright.
mhm, mhm
and if I walk through some neighborhood, there in mexico, an unsafe one,
mhm, mhm
be sure that I will not get out of there with my wallet.
wow
not even, I mean, but in, I, in, in like an hour. I mean, no, they won't take any time jumping me.
sure, sure, sure
and, they might even kidnap me. I mean, its very more likely that they kidnap me.
I heard that too. I mean, kidnaps like that
Yeah, its impressive. Right now, its- its- its interesting, because kidnaps, they may kidnap anybody. I mean, now it doesn't even matter if you belong to a family
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
that's important, nothing, whoever, they carjack someone, take him, and they call that express kidnapping. Then, they, they, they take you, and take what they can from you. I mean, from some,
wow
thousands of dollars, to, if you have more, well, what, whatever you have. I mean, whatever you have. I mean, no more, people are
mhm
like desperate. Then, you see, they do, they do stupid things, actually. And, its
mhm, mhm.
terrible. But, well, but, well, actually, I mean, lately, there has been a lot more social awareness regarding that, the, the citizens, well, now they're starting to, lets say, to oppose that, do you understand me? So,
people declare the, the, this, assaults, people now oppose,
Mmh.
I mean, there has been a lot more, this, much more participation.  Becase, before there was like, well, nobody.
And before people didn't, they didn't report it because they were afraid.
yes, because, yes, no?  And, because the truth, also, the, the  security system was practically, it was useless.  I mean, one reported a crime, and
mmh.
it was an ordeal of paperwork that I don't know- that didn't accomplish anything.
OK, OK, OK.  Mmh.
E- But, then, finally, they have been, well, let's say, a little more, this, this, reaffirming the action of, of police, and things like that.  And, trying, dial, of a-
Mmh, mmh.
catch more thieves and kidnappers.  And, much more, like that.  Then, people already feel that there is a bit more response, with all that.
Mmh, mmh.
with the reports.
Mm.
Earlier not so much. But, even like that, and also, for example, there was a march in, in Mexico, a couple of years ago,
Mmh.
a year and half ago, almost.  That, it was called, a Silent March for Mexico's Safety, in which everybody went and walked to, to the
to the city's plinth
Mmh.
And, there were millions of people, it was full.
Wow, Hmmm, hmm
I mean, there were, everyone was dressed in white, and everyone was on the streets
Wow, impressive
Then, as you've seen, I mean, it's something like socially needed. I mean, people are
Hmm, hmm
a lot more attention to security
Hmm, hmm, and
anything else
I don't know how it is in Me, sorry, I also don't know how it is in Mexico. But, also, I think here, TV, I mean
it provokes you, no? that there are the same, fear. Because news are really local, and very
yes
talking about it, and every mugging they talk about it, and explain it, and explain it again and
yes. yes, yes, yes
really
yes, a lot of yellow journalism, let's say, no?
yes, yes, yes. A lot of looking for the morbid fascination, and the I don't know what
But yes, yes
And
Well, yes, in Mexico, in Mexico, well, not so much. Not so much, because, hmm, it's so excessive that, that
yeah
practically impossible to be building every assault or every
Mmh, mmh, mmh
each, this, rape, or each, I don't know,
Mmh.
each assault there is.  You understand? Then, it is what it is, tremendously big.  I mean, when there are kidnappings
Of course.
very drastic, or when they are, like the, the, the, the, the case of the two, the two dead women in Juarez, who are, who are
Alex uh besy
yeah its javier
oh hi
hi, how are you, um, i think this is good, i haven't ever participated, but i would like too one day, i don't know
oh, i got a letter last yeat.
oh really?
but um, for, to be a judge, but i then said no
oh, no, um you know sometimes they say that is kind off difficult, more than anything to comprehend.
mhm
Because, later you have too, or you have a problem, of this kind, so, you don't have anything like that on your record, or your data is more secure. i dont know
i don't know, i think that being a judge it something like dangerous, because well, it depends on the cases, and the judge makes the decisions.
so you mean it likes um
yeah
a case that somebody killed someone, or something, or someone that sells drugs.
yeah yeah
whats it called? from the
um well, a narc, or something
yeah, and they have friends, lets say you say, hes guilty, then he calls his friends, and they kill your kids  or your,
oh yeah, you are completely right, no cause you can say its not like that,
ha yeah
and you can make one description of your own
Mhm.
and you can, this could also happen but I'm saying it's optional if you send a letter
Aha
eh ? it is optional if you want it or do you need to go no matter what ? I don't know exactly.
No, this, good the letter that I sent, It said that no, but I sent a letter to my doctor
Aha
telling him that I could not sit for too long because I have a disorder that doesn't allow me to sit or walk for too long, or even stand for long.
Oh.
and then I said that was good, that he did not have to serve the jury
Clearly, yes
And this was last year already
Oh yes, it's like one case, a friend of mine sent them a letter too but as he is working from 6 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon, then no, they said that
the manager of the company said that he was someone that could not, this, someone who could not miss
and I imagine this calls for a letter
Exactly
to sent her to the jury
Well yes, yes, yes. But I don't know, I think sometimes it would be good in most of the cases of
violations of girls and boys
Mhm
if you serve as a jury and and. yes, how it is ? yes, if you realize that the person, if the person is guilty and
you can help that justice can be made, i think it will be a good idea to serve as a jury
Yeah, for that yes, but then, i don't like it a bit
AH.
because no, I'm not very shrill and, right
hay, shrill
no, if something happens, ah, like some child molesting and that of, i don't know, the could put you a video or something, eh
Oh, yes, yes, no, i couldn't stand it, it doesn't matter that it's ugly, i mean horrible that
Oh, no, it's ugly indeed, yes
that you, ah, where did they sent you, i mean, in what state ?
Ah, no i live in Canada
Oh, you're living in Canada, oh
yes. Aha, and you ?
I'm here in New York
Oh, aha
yes, but, ah i was telling you about my friend from Arizona because i lived there in Arizona and
Ya, mhm, oh
and then, then in Canada, eh, it's the same system of eh, you think
Almost the same, i think, don't know
oh, look, mm, eh, nice, really nice, then
Sure. Great.
I don't know, as if I can tell you why the day touches me, well, yes, yes, that's how it was, but, but like you say, you have to be careful, right?
Right, you have to be careful, right.  It depends.  But they don't tell you about that, that sort of situation until you already get there, perhaps, at where the judge is, or a the
Oh, or it might be you, right
or to where it has to be
to, but me, I imagine that they have to have a meeting or a session to tell you, to explain the case to you
sure, but this is when already, you already said yes, that you are going to do it
you are already involved, you've already decided
already to be a jury member
oh, sure, sure, sure
sure, and if now I say otherwise, that now I don't want to do it, well, too late
No, too late
I already said yes
What? What is your name, right?
Bessy, Bessy
Petty, or Sessy or Jessy?
No, Besy, with "B"
Oh, Besy.
Right. Great. And yours? Javier?
Javier, yes, yes, yes.
And, min is easy.
Oh, for how long have you been living in Canada, how much time?
Fifteen years already.
Fifteen years?  Wow.
Sure.
How can you stand the cold?
Oh, well, that, I lived in a city before where winter was super cold and I had enough snow
Sure
snow fell enough
yes
and so, my husband and I decided to move to, to go to the beach
Sure
in an-, in another province
Oh.
and then here, here the winter is like just rain
Oh
and it doesn't freeze over
Oh, sure, and in, in what state, is it provinces or states?
Aha.  It's, it's a province, British Columbia is near, uh, where I live is near Vancouver I don't know if you've been to the city, aha.
Oh, Vancouver, sure, that's not in Washington state?
Yes, yes, more or less, yes, aha, yes.
Yes, no. Oh, yes, yes. And you know I was planning on going, to Vancouver, because some friends from Bolivia were there
Oh, aha.
but I lost touch with them and I could no longer go, because they tell me that life over there is very peaceful, I don't know if it's true
Oh, yes, this, a person with whom I spoke before told me that, oh you must live in a paradise, and I tell him, why?
because there are several islands all around and the sea is really near and you can go to the United States
Oh
well, having a passport
Yes, yes.
can go alone, crossing the border and
Ah.
from here, the border here is like ten minutes away
Well yes, ah.
yes, from Washington,
Oh, and where are you from originally?
from El Salvador
Oh, yes, I thought so. I'm from Ecuador.
Ah, aha
yes, because I hear, a little bit of an accent like from Salvador. yes, well how nice, and maybe one day I'll see if I can go, because I tell you here
Yes, Yes.
here it's like, like the subject of justice, no here it's also like sometimes no, no things aren't good
Yea. And, there are
and, and he, and he, what?
Ah, uh, sorry
yes, what.
No, this, there are, uh, what's it called? Ah yea what what let's say, you kill someone and they give you the death penalty
Ah ok.
uh, there are, are there any states there that do that?
what, here in the United States?
the pen-, the death penalty, yea
Right, yes, I mean yea, they give you the gas chamber or you know
Yea. But I, I was watching something in the, something on the news the other day, that this woman, she killed her three kids
yea.
the, the, she put them in the water and the kids drowned
Oh, yea, yes, yes, yes, yes.
and so and my mom tells me, no, they should put her to death, drown here and I tell her, it'd be better for them to send her to jail, because in jail she'd suffer more
with the other prisoners knowing what she did, and because she
Yea.
or, I'm saying like mm they'll do stuff to her, put her in pieces, I'm saying
Right, the, the, they're treat her badly or she'll be bad off, but yea just think that ok, yea, a serial killer that, killed someone and
and next, what, to the gas chamber? No, well they have to give them a punishment, yes or not? of a few years
OK, of course, something that makes him suffer no, because if they just kill him and
Yeah, right, that too.
suffered, mm, what, ten minutes or whatever, and was but, but if they put it in jail, ah the other inmates, mm
Mmh.
poor him
yes, well no
There yes, there people do suffer, I say.
Of course, it is, there they are going to discount him
Mmh, there they are going to, there he is going to pay for what he did, OK.
What he did.  I don't know why, why ah, do people do that, no?
OK
OK, but well, as I tell you
Who knows? Crazy people.
people are crazy
Mmh.
and as I tell you here, it is becoming every day more difficult you hear the comments, that in Canada everything is more quiet
OK, here it is more calm, yes
yes
because I imagine that healthcare of, of the United States, it is not, it is not so good, or, or it is like the, the, this, what is it called?
How is it called? This Mmm, a, a card given for health care? I don't know the name
Oh, the, I don't know here, Medicare or something like that
Yeah, me-, Medicare yes, that one
Yeah
No, it's not so good
Yeah, exactly
or, Or yes?
And there?
Ahm, here is.. mmm.. I say it's good, because...
More fair then
It's more fair, yes and here is more fair than...
Today, that's good
than there
Hey, and, what about job opportunities there?
Yes, ah, They're seaching for a lot of people to work in construction
what kind of? any ki-? Ehm, contruction
sure, huh, I think it's making buildings or something like that
Yeah.
Yeah. They asking in other provinces
Oh
ok, but if someone has, if someone has the experience constructing buildings or houses or something like this
Yeah, yeah.
I imagine it is possible to apply for a visa, or something, I do not know
oh, no because
Aha.
because I was hearing that is true, that, that, this country -Canada- needs a lot of people, isn't it?
At least in the, in the province where I am, eh, eh,I heard yesterday on the news  that was requiring people to
to, to work in construction
Oh, yes, there, there, there is a program, it is on the internet and if I can accumulate points, as seventy-four, and I will
I can go to work and the government help me with everything
For, to where? Here?
Yes.
Oh, Really? oh, I didn't know it
yes, that is
mm
if I could do
Mmm.
I'm a little interested in doing that, you think?
Is well.
It would be nice.
Yes
And have you have any problem in court or something?
Me?, no
yes
Hello? Hello? G hello? Hello?
Hello? Sorry
Hello, if not, okay, uh, What is your name and where are you from?
John, eh, of New York
Okay, my name is Jennifer of New York.
Oh. And you?
Okay, let's start this thing, so we can finish quickly.
Yes. What is the topic? He heard?
Okay, So uh the theme uh uh, was interracial marriage.
Oh okay because I did not hear mine very well.
Oh, yeah that was the theme today. So, what do you think about interracial marriage?
To me, it's not that important. After all, they're in love with another person.
Hm mm
yes, marry whoever you want
Yeah, well I
I'm not - I do not believe it's important. They do not have to import anyone either.
If they asked what if we thought it was easier for certain races to marry as white or Chinese,
I do not
Uh, the blacks and the Hispanic, things like that I wanted to know
I do not think it's easier, it's not better but, because as a Latin American, not if you're living now it depends on where you live, if you marry, if I'm Latino and I marry with a brown or something,
Hm mm
in many places, perhaps many people will criticize.
Oh, yes, they always criticize. Criticize yes, if you marry
We are, yes
yes, yes if you marry a Hispanic girl,
Yes, but all races. What race are you?
I, I am uh, my father is Dominican.
Ah, and your mother?
I'm, both parents.
Both parents are Dominican, Well, I'm Puerto Rican.
Yes Ah well yes, my husband is Puerto Rican.
Yes
So Ah, that was also a problem.
With his.
With his family of course, his family doesn't like Dominican people.
Yes
So however, when you look at it, that has nothing to do with the race, because even my husband says it. If we were to get into details
each family's stuff, if it was a family situation,
Yes
my family has even more professionals in my family, we are more educated, uh,
yes
unfortunately, we are more economically stable. However
Yes, I
the only reason that I would not be like by them, was that my last girlfriend who was older than me was Puertorican,
and I am of Dominican parents, born and raised here
if not, I have Dominican family
Aha
I have many cousins who are married to Dominicans,
G
and um, so, they have left
Aha
Divorced and all, I have no contact, and yet ever time I see the girls, oh we are, that's my cousin, they have lived with us and everything.
Aha.
And how I was raised, with my family and I have many Dominican friends.
Yeah, uh, I can not stand the ignorance of
I have family that is black too. My cousins have married with them, uh,
is yes, a wife of my brother is, um, African American, it, you know
Yes, are you from New York?
What?
Are you from New York?
Uhm eh, Mannhattan
Oh, I'm from Bronx
Oh ok. So yeah, so um the topic for me, I understand it, I have been raised here. In New York. Um
Yeah, that's what I think so too, I think
I understand and it's not a big deal for me. If the two people are happy,
Yeah
ah, no, I care a little that they are green and yellow, uh pst
Yeah, me too, I went out with girls of different races.
Hm mm
They are, um, I don't know, it doesn't matter for me. My first girlfriend was a dominican.
Ah ok. And, the funny thing is that not all of us are equal.
Yes
Because there are Dominican people in my own family, that do no like me
Yea yea, As I, I have some friends that are dominicans,
me, I do not like them
but they say that they dominicans, but they don't tell much to other people that are dominicans, because they are treated badly
Yea
Because some of them are fresh and that, he said, that I have, and they don't have, because their same familly said that they are fresh<weird phrase>
Hm mm
As you said, there are a few of them coarse, all those things are -
Yes, uh, um.
They're very, uh, nasty.
Yeah, but
They themselves get embarrassed, and i told him/her that they shouldn't be embarrassed  because there's that in every race.
But, uh, exactly, they don't, i love to tell people, i talj them in my professional life, i talk to all kinds of people, and what i tell them is
i talk to them, ¿where are you from?, I'm Dominican
Yeah, i know a guy, OK
¿What?, ¿from where?, how can it be, i thought you were, what has that have to do with it?
No, i know a guy, he's a cop, I'm a cop, right?
Uh, um
And i, he always, he even has tattoos, um, of the Puerto Rican flag.
Right
And i always thought he was Puerto Rican, until like two or three weeks ago, that we did a Barbecue to, like more than three weeks ago, to say goodbye to summer
Right
He was sitting there, and his wife is there talking, and, something came up about he swore that, and the flag. And i didn't know that, and they said that he swore on the flag that he's not Dominican and this and that, and he made
Uh
His, uh, like when he got his citizenship
Uh um
and he always said he was Puerto Rican and all, and he changed his papers to say he is Puerto Rican
But, but that's
That he was born here, but he changed everything that the parents and all, all that.
He's your friend, but that is ignorance, because
Yeah, I said, but and why did you do it, then he said, because those people don't ta, don't talk to me. He doesn't
you know
he doesn't want to know anything Dominican, I say, but I, that's not that way because right now, there are Puerto Ricans who don't want to know anything about Puerto Ricans, but
Yes
through life they say oh, I'm Puerto Rican.
It's that, no
They never di- they never change. I don't know why you should change it.
Exactly
And he well no, I am I am American, Puerto Rican American, and with that you don't do
That is  it doesn't have, that is, I'm sorry that's ignorance.
Ah I, I being Dominican, hey I'm Dominican, because I can't change it.
Yeah, that eh
Not like him, who's been paying and paying, to change everything, so that it comes down to that he's Puerto Ri- and do, and, and, from New, New York
And you still, you being know that that doesn't have anything to do with that.
Hm mm
That, that doesn't change anything because still.
Yeah Where, where, where I'm working now,
Uh huh
at the Bronx here, there are a lot of dominicans. there are, are, are a lot of boricuas. but there are Dominicans too.
hmm
that a lot of people talks, ok, the Dominicans are beasts, they don't know how to do anything, there are many, many dominicans.
there are of every kind in every, every race.
this, you say, there are more Dominicans than whites.
yes, now there are because this is true about dominicans, they love multiplying
yes
having children
yeah, no, and then the the, the Puerto Ricans don't say anything, because the more, as they say, the more hispanic, more latins, better.
yes
the whites are the there are many domincans, and that, and that, and that.
yes
this Puerto Ricans want to take oh, all here
eh, but, you know, that
that is
eh yeah, i want to speak english, eh, i can't, we can't
i know then, I'm getting up myself as well
but all- that's because the brother, is a policeman here, on Manhattan
yeah, yeah
on the twenty-three and, yeah, house um, and, he uh and i work with uh, at inves- ah, as an investigator, but i work with mostly policeman.
Yeah
So on that
yeah
So give me a second, I always say that, always, Where are you from? After they talk to me after a while, after I've helped, they tell me things, from Dominican people, in front of me.
They've said, oh yeah, yeah, they say, oh where are you from? uh, dominican.
yeah, I've, I'm also talking about dominicans.
um.no
but in front of them, The same Puerto Ricans in front of them.
yeah, right
talking is one thing, there are some that talk about them, then they fall, until they score a point.
Oh yeah, right
because when I'm sometimes talking in a group, i say, look, hes dominican, hes dirty, this and that, but im talking in a group.
ha ha
Two or three dominicans, with two or three puertoricans.
ha
With white people, like we talk.
yeah why
but
it works, but its just that, the difference is that people criticize, a person, and describes, a Dominican that's standing  on the sidewalk.
yeah, cause when i see people in the street, that i know, or that i see, are Dominicans, that have a flag,
Oky, but yea
I, dominican, come here.
Yes exactly, aha
Like that yes
they're recognizable because, unforunately, the worse dominicans, the ones that are doing the things are always painted, they have tattoos
Yes like the
they have a shirt, are
Yes like the women also
Yes
Yes the ones from far off because of something
Oh yeah, eh, yeah, yeah that also, but we are all not like that. That that is whats comical because when I was in the university that was where are you from?
New York, Oh oh what , what, how what what ethnicity are you, oh, I'm Dominican, oh no.
Yes Yeah
I don't think so
Yea Yeah, turn around
Yeah, Oh, no, that one, that one is unfortunately that's a, a trait we all have But, but still, it's the whole point of
Excuse me the point of de uhm because we have that attribute
Yea
No no I don't want to say that we are all the same
Yea
Because I have cousins that embarrass me, because they are sluts, basically
Yea, oh no no I didn't mean it that way, I meant it with the back part
And no no, but no no I understand but you know, let's you go, to, to the heart of
yea
Eh, it's like that, and I also have people
Yea
you know, we are professionals we do what we do, and regrettably ok, so my grandmother had a good back part, and everyone inherited it
Well yeah, but you know, it's like that always, it's like
but
they are as you know like sluts, like you said
No
Puerto Ricans
Eh we all have one
Dominicans, hell yea
yea, so it's like, but, it bothers me that such a simple thing like you know, you are Puerto Rican, I am Dominican
Like, look at me, my family, with their own cousins, and everything
No no no. I know, but
I know that for a fact
Yea, but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity
Yea
Dominicans, Republicans, Santo Domingo are what, like ninety miles apart? We are closer than Florida and Cuba
Yeah
And we hate each other just because of where we were born, what is that?
Yeah It's not even, it's because like some, like the Dominicans say, oh, dominicans think they're better than us, and Puerto Ricans think they're better than us, like that.
Exactly, yea, but I, you know
And that's all starts, like even in chatrooms, in the computers checking out the chatrooms,
Hm mm
and that's just like crazy, the way that we're fighting.
It just, it makes me laugh, I usually don tell people until I'm asked, but, I never deny my race.  Like people say something, and I'll stand and be like, oh, hold up.
Yea well, the reason why I part asked you why you're from New York, 'cause
Hm mm
like what part of New York, 'cause you sound like white
Get out of here
Yeah, you sound like white.
Oh thank you so much, I speak Spanish like a white person too?
But, no nothing, nothing of course, not now, let the Spanish come out
Oh L / let me find out, ok, That's another eh, that's anohter thing that bothers me.  Just because a perso is, um, You what, what does it mean to some white
Yeah, like
You know what I'm saying, what
Like me, when I told you I'm from the Bronx, I thought you were going to hang up, because I had three callers, I todl them I'm from the Bronx, and they hang up
Hum, mm
they hang up on me
No, abs - please, I'll tell everybody I don't care
In, in Florida Disney World
Hum, mm
It was a line, and we were standing a few excuse me, "cause you had, the line was moving, but they weren't moving"
Aha
and I had, I said Bronx New York and they Oh, honey, come one, they're from the Bronx, and they moved, and they got off the line like
out embarrassed,
No, it's no, it's no your fault, it's not
I was like, oh, oh well
your fault is not to, is, you know, people act ignorant around me all the itme, and say stupid things like that, and it's like
Yeah
Hello ?
yes, hello ?
Hello, good evening
good evening, how are you ?
Fine, who am i speaking with ?
David
Ah, David is Joe or Jose
yes, how are you ?
Ah, fine fine, where do you live ?
Here in Connecticut, i think i talked to you a week ago
Ah, yes yes, how are you ?
yes, and it hung up, the call was hung up, no ?
yes, i don't know why
EH, i don't know why it hung up
Ah. Yes, I do not know what they are going to do with that, because they have
What's up how are you ?
all the calls that, it hung up, and yes it seems too
yes
lots of people that, i don't know, there are so much calls that they didn't processed. Then i think they don't know how much valid calls
every person has. Then, i don't know what they will do. Because there are lots of persons that, fox example, my mother has reached 25 calls already
Oh, yes?
But, she knows there are many calls that were not cut off. Then, have no idea about what to do. Right?
Or, they are still calling you, or not?
yes, they're still calling her, i don't know, two weeks ago, yesterday they were calling her. But, it seems to me they still, i don't know, But,
Oh, therefore, they only, pay for twenty five nothing more, No?
i guess that's right. I guess that's right., But, And, eh, if, the thing is, at the end, the thing is that, it seems to me that it is not well organized, and it surprise me because
they have do that a lot of times, the, the, the, -LDC, why they did not before two years, or a year and a half ago
yes, do it in english, No?
But, before, yes, was, eh, like, was in english, but also they had it in arab, and and spanish, and whatever, But, yes,yes, t- that is old history. They have done it a many times, then,  i don't know, or al least one time
Oh
And that time, like, many months, Then, i don't know now why so suddenly is something new, ah
Oh, right. Am, sincerely, I don't know, i mean, right
No
is, is, is quite clear, because, the last time, eh, right, they have the, the topic, it was about m- about religion,
and they were for fifteen or twenty days they were pure, pure, the same top-, ah, the same topic
Oh, i know. No, no, no. And, and not only that the, the, the recorder that was, i guess, some, some type of computer, or something that they have there, eh
Yeah
And, that, that, that, that i tel- i, that´s, that's my theory, that what they tell you was that they write for you the text in english, of what he wants, that, that, that i have to say
that, that,that one have to hear, Right?
Ah
Then, they went to the care- this, translator, Then they put the text there,
Aha.
from English to Spanish, and then, right there, of, of that, they copied it to a computer that, that, that made, I don't know, wat, t- t- then, that there are computers, or there are programs that one
puts, puts a text, then the computer, the computer reads it.
Right,
yes, yes.  No, no, then, then, the translator, it was something like that, type,, I imagine
Aha
Then, what you talked about,
Oh.
I imagine that's what it was, that was a computer.
Sure, sure, sure, Hmm
Then, no, no, no, it didn't only had a very bad accent , but that also everything it sad was, for example, when the calls would end, it would say,
your time is for up
Yeah, no, I never saw it much, because . when
yes, no, no, I do not.  Me neither, since, I, I, I didn't even pay attention until, until after several times  Right? that I heard it, that, that, that I did not understand anything ?  Right?
yes.
And, then, one time, over there, I heard, yes, your time is for up.  Or, for example, one time, ho-  What was it? that they had, ahm, the, the topic was dating,
then,
Hmm.
the, the translation into Spanish was to put on a date.  Then that, like that,  How do you like to put on a date?  Things like that, that are
Yeah
Ay, incredible. But, and, and they obviously have to have people that speak Spanish, right? Oh, I don't know. So that then, no
Yeah but, kno- it depends
it hasn't been well, very, very, very well organized,
No, because they are always tired of the system, because if you send them an e-mail, they answer you form behind, the next day, very quickly.
Mhm. mm, yes. Shudong, yes. But, the great thing is that they at least pay well. You're not bothered a whole lot, but well, you do have to answer
but it's not, not too much there. And they pay well.
Yeah, but, ah, with, with me, I, I, the last time I did it and it was over.
Mhm.
And, and I don't know what happened, they called me back later, and they didn't have a phone to call him or something like that, but they sent me a check.
Mhm.
You, it's been like sixty days, maybe about two months have gone by, and they sent me a check.
Mm. Mhm.
I had forgot. I didn't even know.
Ah, a surprise.
Yeah, that's, that's true and you live in Philadelphia, right?
yes, in Philadelphia, yeah, yes, well my Mom lives in the suburbs, and I live here, eh, in, in West Philly, in
Okay
at the university. So
Oh, because you all live outside as well. Is that right?
I'm, I'm very close, Hmm?
at school? You guys go to Penn State, you said, no?
No, no, University of Pennsylvania, yes, no, yes, it's different, yes, everybody gets confused with that, because there is, well, Penn State
it's in, in, the state's center
Yeah, yeah
and it's, uh, it's a public university
Right
And then, uhmm, then, the university I go to, it is University of Pennsylvania
Ah, in two different universities, then
yes, exactly, yes, it's a private university and it's in the city, it's completely different. The other one is a lot bigger, it's public, it's in the country.
Yeah, those that walk in, and something else like that, no?
Ah
Where the mountains are, no?
I don't know. Well, I've never been there, I, I don't know exactly where it is
Over there. Oh.
But, I know, I know it's in the center. Well, maybe, maybe in the eighty-one, maybe one, probably. But, but, even though the eighty-one, I think it goes more towards -
no. Maybe yes, maybe yes, because I know the eighy-one goes o, I don't know, I'd rather not say anything.
For mine, it's the same
yes, my, e-e-e, yes, all I know about the eighty-one is that, because we used to live in Tennessee
and northwest
Aha, Alright
And then, near Virginia, we lived in Virginia then we went to Tennesse. But, what a know was the 81 was close by. Then
Ah, OK
It seem like that Hayway is long, I don't know, but Are you a student or what do yo do?
Oh, no I whish I was working, uh, I wish I was going to school
mhm ah O.K.
BUT, AHM
I think it is easier
Yeah, You think that but when you are in the school you have your friends, you don't have to go out to talk to your friends you Know.
No, you Know everybody is there in the same school.
yes,yes yes yes
But when you finish and you are home it's hard to have to pay bills. It is better when you are in the school
if school is good, the thing is when you finish college you have more expenses
right? You buy a car, and want to buy things, then you have to work to pay your bills right?, but when you are a student you live there
Yea, you have to.
there I don't Know, do you know the instant ramen soup?
No, no
no, no The soup that cost twenty five cents?
oh, yea yea
Yes you live eating 25 cents instan ramen soup
Yeah, yeah Yeah
one spends a lot less, but is a life more, tranquil, yes is tranquil, but also I think that, that when people remember when they were students, they forget everything, how hard it is. Right? But,
Sure, yeah
yes, yes, but is also a life more one has more freedom, more flexibility with time, for example, if tonight, if I want to spend
all nigh awake, and then, I don't know, studying, and I don't have classes tomorrow, it doesn't matter. Right? Because, if one day I don't want to go to class, I don't go to class. Right?
Eh, yeah
But, in your job, you can't say, I didn't want to go to work today.
Yeah, well that doesn't happen.
Only if, no, no, no is not very flexible.
No, No, your abilities
MM.
in life. When, when you leave school, everyone calms down, you know, they have their family, or they get married, you know.
You know, they have kids, oh and life gets harder. No?
Much harder.
Yeah, that's why, if you want to live the American life, let's say. You know, the American dream
The dream of the Americans, you know, that, that want to buy their house, that this and that.
yes, yes, yes, the problem, is that I feel that, you have to be happy with what you have, and it seems to me that is what
many people don't do, because your income increase, and with that, obviously, the work, the responsibilities that you have increase. Right?
But at the same time,
Right
everything that one consumes, it- one, one goes to buy a better car, and one, maybe, does this, and does that, and does the other. And that's it, when you pay attention, the money's gone. Right? And, one stays, it looks to me, only with responsibilities, right?
yeah
So, I don't know I, I am, I don't know, now, ah- I am happy like this as a student, for now, right? But, eventually, sure, one has to save money and buy a house. But,
I don't know, th- that's pretty scary, like that, to have so many fixed payments. Right? because, it's just that one works and works and works,
Yeah
and one feels that, that you're not enjoying the money. Right? But, also that, in part, is because one says, well, one doesn't think in all the benefits that one gets. Right? but, also
one has a car to go to work. Right? so, one has to have that, to, then one has to cut the weeds. I don't know, I think it's too many,
Right Yeah
to much, like that, fixed payments, it's fixed responsibilities. It's, I don't know.
Yeah. You're more, more responsibilities in life.
yes, definitively.
But, you know, but, and the, a poor man's life, it's more, easier.
yes, no.
The life of the poor, doesn't have to do with anything, you know. If you want to work, you work, if you don't want to work, they take care of you.
yes, yes, that's it.
You know
His wife takes care of him.
Yeah, more or less, same thing, you know,
yes.
for, eh, you ha- you have to get a, a good woman, that, well, the other, that can help you, that, that has, that has, umm, a house, or that has an apartment, that helps you, this and that. But,
yes, yes.
but that's not my life, right? you know
yes.
Live and learn
if not then I think that is why you should be careful
as you spend the money. Because it's very easy. Because, for example, if you buy one thing, you're tempted to buy another and another, you'll have nothing and you'll feel like you won't enjoy the money. Right?
One has to look seriously
Right
what is more important to me. Right? That is what I like to do.
Right, but not e...
And if not, then it's not. So, it's better not to spend the money on that. Right?
I'm telling you, the big companies, you are giving them your things.
That's what I think.
Do you not see that the big companies they give you cars, no money down? They give you the things,
