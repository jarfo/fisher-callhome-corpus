Hello, good evening.
good evening, I'm Norma from atlana
oh well, look at that, I'm from
oh yeah oh we are close.
yes, we are very close, is this the first call you've made?
yes, because yesterday, what happened was that i went out, they called me, the computer called me, but i wasn't there.
i couldnt respond.
oh OK and I'm with my cellphone, they called me three times, but i was at the store, so i couldnt pick up.
of course
but, where are you from?
I'm peruvian, and you?
Puerto rico
oh Puerto rico that's okay
yeah yeah
so.
well, yes they told me we could talk about marriage, or talk about anything.
yes talk about anything and everything, but we have to use the word marriage.
oh ok, well, we use it right? are you married?
yea, I'm married
oh okay
Eight years ago.
Ah, well, v- that's very good.
and you?
No, no.
Ah, you're not married, ah, OK.
No. I was married, but not any more. Yes.
Ah, you're divorced. Ah, OK.
Well, and have you been in Atlanta many years?
yes, t- tan years already.
A- Same as me. I have been here eleven years, I arrived here in ninety four to go to university.
Ah, I, I came on ninety five.
Ah, OK.
through the temple. So, after, here, here I got married.
Well, it could be said that, it could be said that you already are from Atlanta, then.
Yes, more or less.
More or less. But, do you return to, to, to Peru once in a while?
No, since I came, I haven't gone back.
Ah, OK.
I haven't been back. So,
It's hard, no?
Aha
It gets difficult, sometimes you get entangled in your own life and it is difficult to visit your own homeland
yes and also, also the money, if there is enough of it. That is the problem I think
Yes, right.I know what it is to go back, yeah, the flight back to Puerto Rico, if it is for sale, it is not so expensive. You can get one
at least two hundred return
Ah, yes Ah
But, if it is not for sale you are paying five or six hundred per person
Ah, yes, Because Puerto Rico is near. Right?
yes, about three hours from here, flying.
yes, it is near, But I have to go to Peru, It is in South America, So
yes. Then I imagine, it is much more expensive
Ah, yes. Much more expensive, It is very expensive
Do you have relatives over here?
No. I came because-through the temple, I belong to a religious organization. Then I came through that.
Ah
And, I suppose that we should talk more about the marriage. Right?
Well, they said that we could talk about anything. But, you know
Mhm.
If you wanna talk about marriage, then, we can talk about any marriage.
Aha, OK Which marriage do we talk about? Let's see,
I don't know.  Mine lasted three years, and it was honestly, it was because I got married, too, you know, n- too young.
Oh, okay.
And, no there was us, since, you know, we had ideas that weren't
And-
compatibles the one with the other.  And the, when we started the real life, that
Hm
that we can say, then, we could not, not keep the relationship.
Oh, if, then.  And, you had children from your marriage.  No?
No
No, you did not have children.  Oh
No.
Well, at least, in that, it is one, it is not much weight.  If one has children, it then becomes a little more problematic.
No, and we could not __- you know, we got a divorce, but we remained fr- friends, een though there have been several years that I have not heard from him.  But, we went, you know,
Aha.
it was not something ugly, neither we broke up like that with hatred, or anything like that.
Hmm.
And, I always with the best for him, but simply that we kn- we made a, a mistake i- in regald to our age and our maturity when in,
did that.
Hmm.  Oh, if then  To me, at least, I am going to day, by God's mercy, that I am doing good in my marriage.
yes. thank God.
yes, there we are with the blessings.  No, and-
Well, that means that you met your husband here.  Right?
yes, yes.  I met my husband at temple where I was living.  He
In Atlanta.
he belongs to my same religion.  Then, we got married there.
Am, but, He i- he is from Peru also?
No, he is an American.
Ah, OK.  And do you have children?
yes.  I have to, two children.
Ay, how great.
One is seven and the other one is three.
Ah, may God bless them.
Ah, how great, thank you, you too.  There, let's see, that you find another husband.
I hope one day.  But, if not, you know, I am happy with my life.
Let's see if you go for the second marriage.
yes, let's see a, yes, because I, I said, after that, I said that the next time, I am not going to get married until I know that,
and it is not in my heart that it is not going to be forever.
Ah.
That it doesn't matters what comes, I can endure it and I can last.
Mhm.
So, we'll see.
Yes, well, I ho- I hope so, well, that she finds a good person, right?
yes, that's the most important,
Mhm.
to love him and have faith.
Yes. Let's see, what else can we talk about? what other marriage can we talk about?
I don't know. How about your parents, are they still in Peru?
Ah, yes, I was in Peru, my mom was in Peru. And, I don't, I don't have a dad.
Ah, OK.
And my sib- and my siblings, no, my siblings and my mom are there. And, the family of yours, where is it?
Ah. Well, mommy and daddy moved here, after I moved.
Ah, OK. So, they're close by.
And, then, my, my brother also followed me here. And, all, now I have all my family here.
Mm. Oh, good. Look, that's, that's good.
Yes. Mommy lives near the airport. And, daddy and mommy have, I think they will be married for thirty five years this year, in December,
Ah, y- of being married?
of being married, yes.
Ah, really?
yes.
There they married already, for ever.
yes.  They met when, mom has two years on dad, but they met when dad was fourteen and mom was sixteen.
And, they started dating almost immediately, and since then until now, they are together.
Oh, that's great, look.
So, that is a positive marriage we can talk about
That is good.  Eh, yes, yes, it seems that ah, before, no? older people didn't have like- mm, their marriages lasted longer, right?
yes.
Now there are many divorces.
yes.  What happened with, well, you know, of course mom loves dad a lot, and that has a lot to do with it.  But also, what happens with my mother was that she
Mm.
came from a poor family, a sigle mom.
Mmh. Aha
And she never had anything that she- could call, you know hers.
Ah, OK
And then, when she found my dad.  And he was the love of her life, and she got married, well, then she had something, her family.  It was,
you know, her belongings.
Aha.
And, she a lot, because of that.
Ah Ay, she, there, she was with him, there enduring everything, good and bad.
yes.  Exactly.  Exactly.
Ah, yes, yes, that is what happens, yes, well, my mom, my mom when, when she became a widow, because my dad, no, he died, then, she didn't, she didn't remarry.
Oh
She nev- never remarried.  That is one of those old-fashioned moms.  No?  What did she say, I will not m- again I already put up with one, I will not put up with another one.
No bec- But, they also say, and maybe, Right, For, for one, there is only another, another soul
Aha
You know, that there is for you, another person
yes.  Aha
And after you have that person in your life, if it, if something happens and that person leaves, well, you know, you don't have the need to look for anyone else, because you were satisfied with that
yes, that is what happens, then.  Each one of us has a destiny
yes
Your karma, like we call it in the Vedic philosophy
Ex- Exactly, your karma.
Aha.  Do you know about karma?
Oh, yes
Oh, that is good.
Oh, yes.  It is very important to know about that, because a lot of people don't want to take the responsibility for their actions, and they think that no,
Hmm
They are not going to pay what they did
Mhm
And, that is not like this
Yes, this is true. No? Each one does a, has a, each action has a reaction, and if one acts positively, there are also positive reactions
Exactly
or on the contrary, negative actions. And also it is a way to understand. No? Yes
Exactly
Or if, the suffering that someone experiences, no? It's all from relations with karma that one has. Mhm.
And, I have, I believe in karma for my own
Mhm
How do you say? For my own spiritual ideals
Okay,
But even though outside of believing in karma, only, scientifically, as if it were an energy, the energy does not leave. It is not destroyed.
Mhm
For this reason, if you create negative energy, this negative energy has to leave from somewhere
Mhm
Y it is going to come back to you, because you were the one who created it
Yes, yes, this is true
And, from a, well, from a spiritual point of view, which I see, simply, God made everyone to make the best of their lives. But, you are the one that is responsible for your actions.
Hello
Hello
Good night
Good night, my name is Tami
Oh, My name is Norma, from Atlanta, Georgia
Oh, I'm from Washington, Washington the State
Oh, okay, how are you?

So do I
Two kids also?
Yes, I have two kids, one has 19 years old and the other on 15 years old
Oh, they are big now, they become teenagers
Yes, the older left home
He independence himself
Yes he moved like 20 minutes away from here
Ah, he recently moved
The it's like aha, down the hill, already down, then is
Ah, yeah, i know already, eh, everyone, and they still miss him, true ?
yes, i miss him. But sometimes, he calls me, or he comes here the weekends, to eat or something
Mhm
yes, you are married ?
yeas, yes i0m married
From how long ?
Eight
Ah, i have eighteen in, like November
Ah, look, like my kids are still small, one of them is seven years old and the other, made three like two days ago
Ah, still yes, from time to time, i look at the photos of my son and i say my God, how much time did really passed ?
yes, the time passes real quick, and you're not even counting your age and the kids grow up.
yes, yes the other day he was upset with me because he didn't go out and he, a man thought that he was my boyfriend.
Ah, yes ?
Because the people don't believe me when i tell my age
Aha
Then him was braving that i wasn't his girlfriend, she is my mom. I see you with so small children, you must be happy that he thinks that your mother is seen so young
then good bravo Aya, but lately, what i realized is the people
yes
Here's really quick, to get divorced.
Oh, yes, it is now.
No one wants to work on their marriage.
Yes, marriages now are very rare to really last.
Uh.
Right?, now anything, and trouble, and they split just like that
Uh
Many times don't
there's no patience
They don't try, right?, they don't try, don't try to improve things in their marriage
Your hus-, ¿is your husband latin?
No, he's american.
Mine too.
Oh, yes, mine is dark, american.
Yeah, you told me that, ¿how?
Mine is dark, american.
Mine is white, I'm the brunette.
Oh, no, I'm the one with the clearer skin here
Oh
No, my husband is black, no, but he is very kind.
Ah, yes. Yes, my husband always tells me, he says thank God, because I'm from Panama, and he says thank God they sent me to Panama and I met you.
Because the American women, he tells me
Ah, no is just that the Americans are now very independent, since they want to do, no?
I don't like them, he says not so much the being independent, is that they don't respect the marriage.
Ah,
He, that's what he tells me, no he doesn't say it because I'm, I'm very independent but
Aha.
I always take care of him.
Ah, of course, is that suddenly, no, they don't, don't
You know, I don't give
don't value much like before, no? now is different, the whole mentality has changed towards marriage.
No, Mm, yes, is, is so different because my husband works with some guys
Ah.
and they, my husband's co-workers are Americans, no?
Aha.
and their wives give them like twenty dollars every two weeks for lunches the rest they stay with it, they are Americans. Is that it makes me laugh, is that my husband has an XBox so they start playing here in the house, no?
Aha.
and I laugh, because they call my husband, they seem as if they were teenagers, Can you play today? and he says no my wife doesn't let me, I laugh, I tell him
and you? Your wife let's you do whatever you want the others that, they have them that, I laugh I say
working all day one hour to at least relax. No.
Oh really? how awful, right?
That way, and that way I do laugh because also when, it's because when they have lunch, at my husband's work, I tell them, whenever you want to go, just go, I don't care
He tells me, oh we could not go because the one could not go, I said, who didn't him, and hes says his wife, he, he called him
oh, yes, the husband is, the wife is the one that, controls
oh, completely
oh, yes
I say,noway for us
Is that since we like Latina, we are used to many ties, is that, a society more patriarch, patriarchal more than anything
Mhm.
So then, one, maybe because, the way one grow up, right? that for this reason one is more flexible
yes, that's it, I, I imagine one to be a bit more flexible, and they like that and then that one, they are calm, they are more calm with you
yeah
but with these women, I say those, this one will leave
Uh,
because they have him like that, so tight, that man will find a different place
of course, maybe that is the reason why there are so many separations, you know, there are many divorces.
Mhm, but I
Marriages do not last, one of two
Don't understand
of the factors
Um, no, i tell my husband, my, my children are always laughing because we barely, it's just that my husband and i, we don't yell in the house, and yeah, if I'm calling him and, uh
my voice is loud, since I'm at the second floor of the house
Right
my son says "don't fight", i tell him "i'm not fighting, I'm yelling"
Yeah, because if you, like a good Latin woman, sometimes you, they're, they're accustomed, ¿right?, to raise your voice
Right, exactly. And my son, i always tell me: "stop yelling", ¿do you want me to tell you when I'm yelling, pal?, I'll show you
Oh, so
Oh
It's, it's just, very different.
Oh, yeah, societies are different, even if it doesn't seem, ¿right?, even if it doesn't seem like that at first, but there a lot of differences really, cultural differences, ¿right?
Yeah, it's, it's so funny, because my husband knows, since i met him, um, he kinda didn't know how to dress very well.
Right
So i always, i always put his clothes out
Oh, you
In the morning, i say, uh, i don't care, i put it out for him, and they mess with him at work, at work, i say well
if he's the only one that looks good at work, ¿why do they mess with him?
Right
i mean, all of those who go around with holes in their pants and women that you don't see anywhere, and i say, i don't mess with my husband, and he dresses well, ¿what's with, what's their problem with him?
And he laughs, but i don't care that, he says "i'm fine with my woman", he says to me, i say "well", uh, no, uh
Sure, yeah, i also had a, or, i have a friend that married an american, and he's like, he says Latin women are very different
Mm.
yes, really, he appreciates a lot, he says
And yes, is that
No, because he, the Latin girls are very different they don't cause too many problems.
No, and when we love, we love hard
oh, yes, one is more faithful, I suppose
Aha, that's true.
you can tell, no? That one is more faithful, really.
yes, but here
More, more, much more loyalty.
Mm.
Mm.
Not here, here they don't care, I have a, the friend of a best friend of my husband got married and in five years they were already divorced and it was like prostitute and that
other women and I don't know what, and I would say Oh my God and we are in the middle because I was friends with his wife and he's my husband's best friend
Aha.
Oh God, I would say, don't get me in the middle, and, I say that's bad Don't ask me what she said because I'm not going to say.
But like that
Yes, is very sad, no? that now marriages don't last long and even more if they have kids, the kids are the ones that suffer.
yes. yes. there's someone here, my next door neighbor
yes.
ah she married a man and he already had a son about eight years
yeah
and they had two and this woman would, get the boy the boy in the face
ah yes?
do not touch my children you are not my son and I do not know what, and I say ay me I wished I could take this boy and bring to my home.
ay poor children
because the way I would tell them off sometimes I would say the other day i told her you know what I am in my home and I do not want to hear your conversation about that you are doing your ex husband dirty and I do not know why you are talking so loud.
and your children I say poor children that are listening to everything. those bad things you say about their dad.
Mhm sure.
and she says ay no
if the children suffer is enough, they get traumatised when they are so small and have those problems no? at home
Mhm
they get very traunatised
and she took her husband out her home and brought her boyfriend in
Mhm
and I say oh my God if you gave it time for the man to get out and she already has another one
sure
and that one as well, how he screams at the children. how he screams at the children
Ay yes it is a real shame, no? that is why there is so many
i say
many times the government take the children away from people like that when they are not well taken care of
mm, yes this woman
no, they are psychological mistreated or
it does not work
of physical, of physically
yes, that is true, the woman does not work, the father, bought the house and gives her money monthly
mhm
but, I would think, listen, if they give money monthly, do something, help other people of something, not stuck in your house and, and, I believe that is why she is frustrated
oh, yes, well
because she does not do anything, and with those little children, that behave bad, I say, oh God, I would have to yell at them also because, they are by my side, with that rock thrower, and I don't know
oh, yes, they fight strong?
oh, oh, and I, with the husband, we did not get along
yaah
I, he came, to, to scream here in the house, and I send him for my husband, and they would look at me, and tells me I have never seen you like that, and I say well because Latin women when you bother them, and bother
when, no more, you reach the last, and you listen well, he laughs. Says, I have never seen you like this, and I say well, then because I have had enough
Hello?
How are you? Good evening.
Good night, my name is Gloria.
Ah, I am Norma, from here Atlanta, Georgia.
Oh, from Georgia.  I spoke with you the other day.
Ah, sure? Ah I don't know.
Ah.  Ay, what, what, what a coincidence, right?
Aha.
It seems that we are the only Hispanic girls, or what?
I don't know, suddenly.
OK
Suddenly all and the group is not very big.
Maybe, maybe.  What music do I like? I like merengue.
Aha.
I like the charismatic musi we are, ah, playing now in the Catholic church.
Uhum.
We are playing a lot of charismatic music that one of them who sings is young two oaks, um, Miguel Aquino.  To me well, ah, this, it is like merengue, but with with, with Jesus Christ in, in the music.
Ah, what, that is spiritual music with merengue?
yes, exactly.  Exactly, yes.
Ah, OK. Ah, OK.
Then What more did he say? Let me see, what else did he say? We had to talk about music. What... what type of music do you like?
Yes. We had to talk of music. And I like music, right? Music that they call Salsa.
Ah ha
Right? Music that is Hispanic, right? Hispanic music. After than the music we listen to in church, too. We call it Quirta.
Ah ha
Right? The stuff written in sanskrit is also very joyful
Ah ha
And I also like romantic music, right? Ballads that... well I don't think they call them ballads now.
uh... Ah ha
Yes. Yes those types of music. Hmmm
Ah And I also like... I like Reggae music too. But I don't like the words. You know what I mean, but I like the dances in Reggae.
Ah hmmm

Clearly. You are... you are what makes a countryman
Yes. Yes. Yes. I am a countryman. I have to be used to all types of music. I have to dance it all. Forget it. I dance everything.
Ah ha. Clearly. Even your work requires it.
Yes, exactly. I don't have to dance, but I like to dance. Music just gets into my spirit. I like to dance. I like to dance.
Clearly. Because if you are going to entertain children you have to move, right?
Yes. Yes exactly. Although my friend does it without moving "Let me tell" you she says, "Gloria you work a lot with energy"
Ah ha
Because you like to move the children, I say that they remember more of me. That I move that I feel, you know
Sure, of course, if it is something, is an active episode, right?
aha, yes
You want them, if you want for example to teach them a lesson with humour, then it is important that the children
Exactly, aha
feel that they are a part, a part of the program.
Well now that you say modern dance you know, I use a handkerchief.Sometimes they use a handkerchief for, when they are younger sometimes they use a hankerchief and all that
aha
I use a handkerchief in my..,becauseI make a..A conga, everybod wears a hankerchief, a maraca, and a trombone
um hu
o  a harmonica and use many instruments and many handkerchiefs I like hankerchiefs
So, it is all good: aha
my friend, my Panaman friend made many of Dora, I bought three, three yards of Dora. And she cut them and I have many scarfs of Dora
um hu
And of Spider Man so, then I make it as an incentive for thr children, so they, I tell them to win one. Then I raffle two, and then they start fighting, there are more than two, u, u ,u
the children right
Sure, so many times when music is used.
aha
It is like that, and people remember better the things which happen
aha
No, I, above all the children and they are still being formed.  No, they have more memories, they have more memory, so.
aha umhu, umhu
Something like stays more on their minds.
I was going to be a teacher, I took a __ teaching course, of music for little children
aha
to teach them, to see if they have the bility to sing
um hu
then those we used many handkerchiefs, many ih sticks, to see if they know ehm a rythm, you know, if they know tu tu tu tu, tu tu tu
you know, if they can do that, you know so
um hu
But they didn't take me, because I couldn't sing, one needed to know how to sing and play an instrument
um hu
and I couldn't sing nor hold the instrument.
cl
now I am going to learn to take guitar
Sure, music is part of culture, each culture has their own music
yes yes, yes
And is identified, with that mus- that persons identify themselves each culture not with. with a certain music, for example Hispanic culture it many it
um hu
don't identify it with salsa, merengue, not those fast dances, that music there is
um, hu, aha, aha
There is no many people that like that, um hu
um hu, ya wai, wait, Jeffi I´m taling this is business, this is my baby, he wants the charger for the games
ah that one, the fourteen year old one
yes the fourteen year old one, yes
ah, him, yes I remember then
he thinks, he thinks he is going to play now, now he is going to sleep, And you, you, have lots of music at home?
Well, yes, I have music, my husband, he is the one that likes music the best, more than me
ah OK
No, he really likes music, he plays piano a little
oh, that´s nice, I would like to learn to play piano, I would like
yes, and yes he, he then, we have lots of sacred music from our close church
aha, aha
What, he is the one who learned to play harmonium, and bridanga and cartalos
aha
all those, we are also teaching to my children
Really you are a Hare Khrisna really
yes, aha
yes, yes, yes I knew it, OK
yes that, and the music is very important, specially at the church
aha
No, the music always gives a good message.
aha.
for people no, for people who remember then.  No, I see that, even when I watch TV programs
yes, yes, yes aha
Not that I see that Christian people also have their music, that they sing, they show lots of emotion.
aha yes
And all with the music, I mean music really influences a lot people's lives.
yes and also music, they use now they are making musi for math.
um hu
I mean two plus two are four, four plus four are eight and lots, lots of math, of
yes, um hu
to learn to write to spell too, there is a song that if you can write that word.  They teach you to sing it so you remember the lyrics.
um hu
there are many things out there, with music, all is music.  Because many children, sometimes they don't learn more than talking.  My boy learned many things with music
he learned the, the, the times tables with music I taught him like that, you know
um of course, yes because now, for example children when here, in the -abc, in the alphabet
aha
That song that is so famous - abcd
right yes, yes exatly
just there, my little kid has three years old too and he is there playing with this toys, he has a train that we bought for him because it was his birthday a few days ago
aha aha aha
so, he's there, singing, saying the ABC, so, he would record it and he's taping the song
ah you know, I would tape the songs that I used to sing to him in English for my oldest son, to my oldest son
my brother would then tape them in Spanish
um hu
so, one day he would listen to thema in Spanish and then another day in English.
Ah, that's good, aha
I kept a record, yes, yes, I had a book so we bought the book in Spanish, a History book in Spanish, it was really, it was really, by brother said, put in in Spanish too, not just in English.
because I would use to read lots of stories to him and when I was tired I would play a tape and he would play and listen to the story
he, I didn't have to be reading the same story sixty thousand times.
um hu
because when you are young, you have to read a lot.
ah, yes, because when the children are little they are like sponges, they learn a lot.
exactly, exactly
No, everything sticks to their minds, it's the best time to teach them stuff.
exactly, yes
You have to teach them the best things, nice habits
yes, yes, that's true, that's true, yes, anyway, how many minutes do we have, I'm a bit tired, I had a tough day today, oh my God

a matter like that very heavy, like that for the children.
ye
Just because of that now, there are, not that many, that many children and theyget in so many problems the teenagers start to use arms and all of that consequence of all of that influence that they have
All of the
aha
Of all of that music, of everything that the, everything that they see on telelvision and all of the issue of violence.
yes, it is true, the game, those games.
uhm hu, oh, those games too, those games.

yes
you know that the moms and the dads buy them to get the kids out of their, of their sight.

Hello?
Hello, good evening, you're speaking to Mildred from Connecticut.
I think I've already talked to you before. This is Annie from Miami.
Oh, yes, aha, we have talked.
But
How are you? Is everything good?
Yes, good, and you?
Good, thank you, rather.
Eh. I don't remember what the topic that we were given last time was.
I think we discussed marriage.
That was, that was, that you have.
Aha.
Five children, wasn't it?
Aha, aha, aha.
Yes.
And.
Yes-
Today it's music.
Yes.
What country are you from?
So, well, I was born in Puerto Rico but we moved to the United States when I was five or six years old but my parents are Dominicans.
Oh.
so I am, I feel that I am
Dominican.
no, no, I feel Dominican and I don't feel Puerto Rican because I spent all of my summers in Santo Domingo with my family but the, the, my, my ehm, ah, I forgot, my godmother
Aha
that took care of me, was Puerto Rican, so, you know, I have from both of them
Oh. yes, but you don't talk too Dominican, you speak more
No. But, you know, it depends on what, depends on how it comes out
Hmm
And you?
I, well, ehm, no, I am Puerto Rican and I like salsa music a lot
Hmm.
I love to dance
Hmm
and I find that music lets us be known the many countries, at least in Puerto Rico there are many huge, ehm, songwriters and we have artists like
Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony
Hmm.
Gilberto Santa Rosa that are known in many countries.
yes
Oh, I think that the music, I love it, I put in on when I am in the house, I dance, I clean much faster, it cheers me, it take away my depression
when I feel sad.
mhm. mhm
or when I feel nostalgic about my country
yes
so, I listen the songs that sang, that my mother used
mhm
and you, do you like music?
I like it, I always listen to Christian music
oh
eh, but also, eh, you know, since I have a little girl, I am trying to teach her, we are going to teaching her different types of music, so I always have it, that she is listening
eh, classic music or children's Latin music
mhm
oh, or in English, you know, the music that is teaching her colors, or the alphabet, or things like that. And now, is this time in my life, I am more
you know, with children's music
yeah
than lets say, than music that I like most
So, how old is your little girl?
bu she goes, she is twenty monts
OK okay, she is, yes is a time for music
yes, and
It's said that children that, that are raised with music, is, from the womb are much relaxed and learn, and are smarter
I don't know if it's true, but
I don't know, las night we went shopping and she was in the car, eh, singing the, that alphabet song
Aha
You know, my husband looked at me and said, you don't know about her, she is a little bit young for that, I said to him, I don't know, but she is singing it.
Yes, no, while the childrem, whil- the girls, the best time
you know
I think they get, from the moment they are born until like the
yes
four or five years or so
yes
Then, they forget a lot of things
Well, to me, all
yes
I always forgot a lot things too, therefore that, eh you know, the music for us is something really really eh, eh
you know, important, we don't watch much television
ah
so all she, let's say, learn the animals, or whatever, is from the music and, and the books we read
Oh, that, that's goo, eh, retarded children also leran a lot with the music
yes.
because my son had a partner who had eh had a little boy that with down's syndrome and
Aha.
and she played music and he learned all the dances and everything really fast
Mmh, mmh.
He learned fast.
yes.
And he memorized the songs
yes, to, she is like that, eh, many times they already start eh, I don't remember who is what he sings, but we have a disc that is call- the song is called
my aunt, or aunt Monica or something like that
Aha.
and that she liked dancing and when people see her dance they say ulala, ulala, you know
Aha.
whatever it is, and today, about two or three weeks ago that he doesn't listen to that song, and started the whole day ulala, ulala, and I was thining, OK, now the song is being remembered.
you know, but I like because I, you see that, that she moves her feet, her knees, her ca- you know, so
Aha, Aha
we can also do the movements and she learns the parts of, aha
yes, she, she exercises, mmh
the parts of, of the  body, so you know, everything though
yes, it helps her to learn, to, to know her body and at the same time it relaxes her too, because the music is good.
And also the language. Because what we're doing is, you know, when my husband is not home, I speak to her only in Spanish
then when he comes home, all the time, well, ninety percent of the time in English some times, you know, I keep using Spanish because I'm used to it, but
Yeah, yeah
That way she can hear both languages, and that's the other reason why we have so much music for her, so she can hear it in English and Spanish
I like that, I go a lot to concerts when they have salsa concerts, when they have
Yeah
merengue concerts, I don't, I don't go a lot to merengue concerts. Well, what I like the most, I like a lot the typical music, music of
How do you call it? we would call it from inside the country
La plena, and things like that
La plena, la bomba, all that and after that when in
hmm
New York they have presentations of, of bomba and plena, well, we go there
hmm
And we go to Olga Tañon concerts
hmm
she, she has a lot of nice music, and also this boy who plays salsa, this, God, what's his name, Victor Manuel
hmm
I never miss their concerts, we always go to see them
Well
They have a lot of concerts here, and we always go to see them
Mmm, And for me, i prefer merengue
Yeah.
istead of salsa
yes, because in your family is more
but
Dominicans, because I imagine that your family is more into dancing Dominican music
Oh, well, it's the same, because my parents lived in Puerto Rico, i think like twenty something years before arriving to the United States, so
Oh, really?
You know, we are not the typical family
yes
because they lived in Santo Domingo, so the revolution they had
Yes, they left
The went to Puerto Rico, and from there to Miami
Oh, and they stayed there
Yes, you know, the spent a lot of time in Puerto Rico, and that's because I don't really know what country I am from, because I am like
a mix of, you know, both.
Like a boy from the place of my girl, they ask him: What country are you from?, and he said: I'm a mix salad. They ask him why and he said: because my dad is
my dad is from this country, mi mother is from another one, and my grandparents from another one, I am like a mix and even I don't know who i am
Yes, that's how I feel many times, I feel uncomfortable sometimes, but you know, I don't feel that much Puerto Rican
y don't fell that much Dominican, it depends
Uh huh, uh huh,
so but, you know, I, I enjoy that of the two cultures, and it's not that they're so different, but you know, they have they have some eh
words that, that
I all the traditional music of my country I have shown my daughters
Mhm.
I have taught them the dances, I have taught them the music and them but no, they will not listen to it so much, but they know how to dance it
yes.
and then, here I belonged to the group for the Puerto Rican parade
Mhm.
and and we did dance performances, and I was encharge of teaching the girls to dance to dance bomba, to dance plena
Mhm. That's beautiful.
to dance salsa
Mhm.
so the, the, my daughters know how to dance all that because the, they like all the music.
I
Everyone likes the music.
And also the, what to me, the salsa, you know this well or whatever, but I think that of all the music, I like traditional music
yes, the traditional music is the most beautiful, much more beautiful
you know yes, and as not, yes, no, I don't know what I like more and I like to watch her dance more than when the people dance salsa or whatever
I, I also like the Peruvian music that I find beautiful,
Hmm.
The music of the Chinese in India, well I like it a lot, their music is, it's beautiful, I don't understand what they're saying but
Yes, but the sound it has, you know, how it, relaxes you
yes
And, now when I went to Puerto Rico I bought a CD of those who get music from the water
Ah.
From, from the trees, from
Hmm, Oh, how nice.
Ah, when you want to relax, when you're really tense, well you put on this music and it sounds really nice.
Hmm.
It sounds really beautiful.
Yes, this is good.  Also we- a lot of times we, you know what happens even now, before, before this call, we came back from shopping
Not even five minutes and normally we turn on the radio and put on a, you know, a song that's average
Yeah
Nothing more, this music isn't anything more, it doesn't have even a letter
Yes, aha, yeah, no message or anything.
And so this, this also, helps at least to relax me, yo know, relax or whatever.
And you come with what you have saved and you buy and
yes
For this I say that the music is really important to, well, at least for me
Mhm.
My family and I were raised with music
Mhm.
my kids, my daughter is sixteen years old, she like reggaeton music and he likes Hip-Hop music.
Aha.
Mi daughters are older and they listen to more American music.
Yes.
And
Yes.
And i, for exam- the rock and roll, i listen to it and i share with the boys, but i can't tolerate t for too long
Yes.
It gets to my nerves, it kind of agitates me.
Yeah.
So i don't like rock and roll much, i listen to it and i have some young friends that have a, a band.
Uh um.
And sometimes, i get invited to go see it and i watch it, i stand and i hang with them for a while, but later on I'm like, oh no, we're leaving, we're leaving because my head is like crushed with
the, those sounds in my ears.
I don't care much about that music, what bothers me is the lyrics, what they say.
Oh, yes, about the, the reggaeton now.
yes, that, i, i like that kind of music, but not what they say, and that's why
I believe that, that music from before differs very much from nowadays, the songwriters from before were like more dedicated to romantic stuff, stuff like
Uh um.
the meaning, the things they had, like moral values that, that kind of left you a message
yes
Hello?
Hi, um, what is your name/
I am Mercedes. And you?
Pilar
ah, nice to meet you
Nice to meet you, where are you calling from?
Mm, I live in Pero. I'm from Honduras originally
And where do you say, where do you say you live?
in
in, oh, I don't know that
Mm it is to the west of the city of Philadelphia
Ah huh
past the following town is
Hm mm
And you?
I am from Spain, and I live I live in New York
Ah no, I thought that they were talking, only were people in the Philadelphia area
No no, from what I've seen, of all of Europe, of all the US, I have already spoken with good people, we have to talk on cell phones, no
Ah yes yes yes yes yes
What do you think of cell phones? Do you have one?
I do have a cell phone but the truth is that it's almost as if I didn't have it, because n- I hardly use it and I don't get many calls either,
if, if I use it it's eh, very super, very rarely that I use it, and you?
I don't have one right now. When I was in Europe, I did have a telephone,
Hm mm
but, I don't have one here because it's very expensive
yes
And I don't have, I have little money because I'm a student
Hm mm
And I have decided not to have a cell phone, but eh, that's not the only reason, also I have never liked mobile phones too much. I'm not sure that they're healthy.
yes ah, why?
Because of the radiation that they emit, Haven't, haven't they made any study?
hm mm
Showing that they really not are not harmful.
Hm mm
And I don't want to use a phone all my life and after twenty years, they discover that it was bad for your health
Hm, yes
and we all have brain cancer, or something like that.
Like almost everything, one starts using technology, let's say like teflon they're doing the same, right, that maybe, maybe
Sure And it's not known until later if it was good or not.
yes
Okay, that's a shame, but
And, but, let's say that you need to drive; what would you think of the (ineligible), for example, of those who drive and talk on the phone at the same time.
Yes, that too; and it's also more dangerous.
And that's terrible indeed; I agree with that.
That's very dangerous; there are many accidents, now they are fewer because people are using that headset or, or free hands;I don't know they call it.
Hm, mm, hm mm
but many people are still not using it. And when you use one hand only, I don't know how they can drive well.
For someo--I think, in my opinion, it doesn't bother me. Hmm, it's the people who have no respect in how they use their cellphone.
Hmm
That's true; the thing is that they have no sense of courtesy in the way they use their
Yes, because it's also true; sometimes in the, in the
their cellphone
in the bus, in the, people talk loudly on their mobile.
Hm, mm, hm mm
And that's is lack of education, right?
Exactly.
Because there is no need to speak loudly, you can speak more quietly, right?
And, and, but I believe, in my opinion, more than anything, is that people who don't respect who they're calling to, the telephone and the people who drive, but
well, that's the con--convenience, that's there, the telephone, the cellphone, it's a technology that facilitates communication in a lot of, of
situations, for example, right now with the hurricane; that's the only way many people could communicate with their families.
yes, yes, well but, I think that they were using satellite phones. The, cellphones work well but sometimes the didn't work and yes
yes, that's right, because we had a friend that was living in New Orleans and we had tried to call him to his cellphone, and the lines were down
the lines
yes, it worked sometimes but sometimes it didn't
it didn't work.  Hm mm
But, it's, they do have their advantages, one of them is that you can be contacted at all times
Hm mm
well, that's if you have enough batteries, yes, if someone needs you or if they need to talk to you
Hm mm
they can reach you there, and that's really good.
Hm mm, hm mm.
And then, well, in the event of emergency.
Hm mm
you can call, I mean if your car breaks down in the freeway or if something happens to you, you can call and ask for help
ask for help, that's good. That's why when I have a bit of money and when I'm able to pay for one, I'm going to go buy a cellphone. I will have to use it with the earphones
That's let's say, they have prepaid  plans. Really, you have some in which you buy a card and you use the amount stated in the card.
Do they have that system here in the United States too?
Mm, I, I think they sell them in Walmart.
Ah, I'll look into that, eh
yes, yes, yes because they say they don't have any, the problem is that you have to sign a contract right, the contracts are never for plans of less than one or two years
Of course
And I have understood that with this card there is no need to sign a contract, and one has a card and one buys what you will use it for.
Clear, because also in the other contract, you have to pay every month
HM mm
and they almost always are plans in which included calls are very expensive
if
E- Europe I had a plan, where you paid a basic service, and you paid for calls, but if you called little
Sine it was much cheaper.
Of course, eh Yes, that alone is the problem that I you-, We have right now. The plan that I have , as I say, almost, have cell phone, but i hardly use
Of course
And by e- at least have one that the, the minutes will accumulate so much, much less going them to deal with all.
HM
Thus there is n possibility for us to use them.
Of course,
But well, there is, therefore, will be cumulative. And, say, in Europe, as it is the culture of the cell. It is similar to the cu- to here in the United States, or
HM. I believe that in Europe it came before
HM mm
the mobile phone, and on- there are countries, I, I I have lived in Austria, and there was, the eighties, more than 80 people had mobile
Or is that the few had no mobile were small children, or the, or the older gentleman who already arrives too late and id not want user.
HM mm
The whole world had mobile. And, and it was good, I have been in the United States for some time, then I left and I came back when I was, that has been already three years, four
No, no one used mobile. The people did not have mobile.
Hm mmm
And in Europe everyone had mobile. Today it has made a comeback, and everyone has mobile here, well well it has arrived here too, and I think that give or take it's the same.
And so well, there are the same problems that are here, the people that do not respect where they used their cellphone,
yes yes, the people more than anything that talk loudly, in the train, in the bus, and well, there, that's being uneducated, but there are people that are on the street talking with
with a handset, instead of using the telephone in the ear, they have the telephone in their pocket, and the handset is very small that you can't see it, and they go talking, and so they look as if they are talking to themselves and
that has happened to me, like i stay wondering as if they are talking to me, or, or to who.
yes, and then you keep thinking that that person is crazy, what's their problem
hm mm
But I'm already, already getting used to it. If i see someone talking to themselves in the street, I thin that they have a mobile telephone. Well good, and another difference is that over there in Europe, the people use text messages a lot than over here I don't think that no one uses it.
There are text messages that are short.
Hm Hm mm
That are written with the mobile and those turn out really cheap, only, and maybe, only twenty-five cents, for sending text messages, well it's cheap in Europe
Here the calls are obviously much cheaper, but I don't know. But, eh, over there the best call will cost you, for that, twenty-fie cents a minute.
Hm mm
And uh, and the minimum is one minute, and , and the difference is that the text messages cost you twenty-five cents a message. And, when you call, you almost always have to talk for more than a minute.
I think, in reality that that here is not common.
Then-
Eh, in my country, say yes it's a bit more common, but I think that it's the same economy of people, truth, because like we say I know.
Of course.
my country there isn't much money like there is here, right. Here the people, here it is twenty-five cents, that is,
That doesn't matter, of course.
Exactly.
But there, well there It was more popular between the students, especially.
Hm mm
Because they have the fastest to write, because, writing with one telephone, is complicated, because it only has nine keys, all which are in there.
Hmm mm, hm mm. I couldn't
but, the, the students converted it in some kind of specie of , of a game and of ability, they even made competition about who could write the fastest.
And they saved a lot of money sending messages instead instead of, calling.
Hmm mm
and. of course, yes you call, and you hang up, without causing a lost connection.
Hmm mm
It is left there written whoever called you.
Okay
So, the young gentleman use this to call, to say, to give out signs, say, when they call you, that's what you call a miss call.
Right
When I give you a missed call, the missed call calls me . Get down I'm waiting you down here, or sometimes solely for display, so that I can remember you.
call and hang up, and I remember you. Instead of sending an email, or simply, that is a message of
Hm
I agree with you, that is many of the people of Europe have a very good imagination when it comes to saving money
Imagination. Ah, many do.
much growth, much creativity
Lots of creativity, that is the right word. No, I think I will have to practice to make a small difference, but most don't use it.
But, I do
and that's the truth, I have you, but I only really want to use that for an emergency
someday I'll deflate the tire of the truck
Of course
uh huh, I like to hear the truth
But that is fine
No
Hey, but you should use a combination headphone with an earplug.
yes yes yes
That's the headset, but it's going away because of the radiation.
yes, yes
just in case
I have to buy one of those, because it is dangerous. The only one who I talk about my family with is my husband, and he always
and what
where is driving, if you are driving hang up the telephone. I do not want you to drive and talk.
sure ,sure
Like, almost never truth is, very few times
Have you hear about the next generation telephones,they are here?
are they the ones that have your credit card information and everything else?
oh, no I
No
Yes I suppose, but I mean the ones that you can watch TV
oh
you can see web, your email, they have everything. It's like a mini computer with web access, it is supposed that some day it would happen, they been working on this, but they are not ready yet.
aha, aha
They have it in Europe and in Australia since last year
oh
I did not see it, I never used it, it was expensive, but that would be great
Somebody who was in Norway told me that you can do anything with your cell, buy uhm buy food froma vending machine
uhm
you can pay the parking meter because they have your credit card information
sure they communicated with the machine
Hello
hello,hello my name is Auria
As is, what is your name?
Auria
Auria, hello I am Nicole
Nicole nice to meet
nice to meet you, how are you?
fine,fine and you?
fine where are you?
i am a little North to Atlanta
Oh yeah, and how is it there how the climate?
Oh hot but very beautiful and where are you from?
eh, I am from New York
ha from New York
yes, I am in the city now
started to get cool or still
no,not cool don't know, the climate until now it has been super humid but today been first day that is not as humid
and when do autumn start and the cold comes?
eh in October, start more like autumn, feels more like  autumn
okay
The cold starts around in december, january, so like in January the snow starts, then its cold until april, so
um okay
there is still more to go
Is something like that, with the exception that it almost never snows here, but it starts getting real cold in mid January and lasts until march.
um
Then spring start, but that doesn't last long, it lasts like three or four weeks then boom its hot.
of course of course, its the same here, spring is really short here, sometimes you don't even notice it.
exactly
its cold then its hot
yeah
hey. and where are you from?
I'm from Puerto rico
from Puerto rico
yeah, what about you?
I was born in new york, but my family is cuban, i also lived in Chile for a while, so my Spanish is kind off messed up.
oh ok, i was born here aswell, i was born in north carolina, i was raised there, but then moved to Puerto rico at the age of twelve.
mm
That's when i learned Spanish
yeah
I mean, to speak spanish, because i understood it, i understood it because my parents talked to me in spanish, but i always answered in english.
of course, so did I, my parents always talked me in english, but my grandparents, I was raised with my grandparents, we lived together
They always talked my in Spanish and I answered in english, so I started to really speak it when I was 14
because, exactly, also at twelve because I moved here when I almost had 13 years old
and I refused to talk any spanish, I didn't want to know anything about Puerto Rico, I was a real rebel, so they took me out of
you know, my school, my friens
Of course, at that age, you feel
Of course, you now, after a year of not having friends because nobody talked Spanish I changed my mind
and, where did you live before moving to Puerto Rico?
North Carolina
Where?, In North Carolina
yes
and because, the topic, I listened that was about cellphones, I really don't know, because they are separate topics, but I have had conversations where someone listen one thing and the other one another
exactly
but, I don't know what do you think about cellphones, if they are annoying
well, it depends in the courtesy of the person who uses it
Mm
In my opinion there must be laws to regulate their use
Mm
I just think that a person should have the courtesy to known that a cellphone should not me used in a movie or restaurant, is should not be used
Of course
o at least excuse yourself and go out
sure sure it is obvious the problem there are people that have no courtesy
exactly
I have been at the moies where the phone rings at a restaurant,where the people are or two people in a restaurant and one is on the phone
or maybe if its an emergency obvious but i do not understand the emergency
yes
there can not be so much emergency
but even if it is an emergency you excuse yourself
sure
i will return in five minutes you go outside you take the call and,and
sure
and yes but people like you say have no curtesy.
um, yes
the only law that i believe should exist to guide
um
because I have seen in front of me many accidents because the person in front of me is on the phone
um
they are in the highway and because they are talking miss their stop their exit they exit
um
and then they do what i call a return to get to their exit and I have seen accidents because of this
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, i agree, absolutely, i mean, driving
at least wear ear buds or an earpiece, like they say
sure, but having your hands free, because you really need your hands free when you're driving, i watch people
if you're going to be in the car
walking down the street, not paying attention becuause they're talking over the phone, driving. it's a lot worse, one should at leas have your hands
to drive, and the other thing is at the hospitals, that you really shouldn't use the phones on hospitals, because the signals might interfere with the machines at the hospital.
Yes
and one should have your phone off on other places, i mean, it's a matter of being considerate of others
exactly
and, and to be eduacated with the people around you, because if you are with friends or family, when you answer the phone in the middle of a conversation, it should be an important thing, it shouldn't be
that you're talking to a friend, talking with another friend over the phone, ¿you see?
or, because that's wasting the time you are with another person
right, right, and the phone is something that's supposed to improve communication
exactly
but i thing that it makes communication worse if you're always interrupted with calls
i, i am, i agree with you, because i thing that a lot of the technology, even though it advances, the communication, like you said, at the same time, we as a society have the bad habit
to walk out of the moment
right, right
you know, with the TV, the videos, and i don't know, the music
with the computers
well, you don't live in that moment and then the phone distracts you from the moment too, I sometimes refuse to answer the phone
If I'm playing with my little girl, she's four years old, she will only have four years for one year, you know
um
you know, I will never be able to go back to that moment
sure
so, if the person is calling me, I'll call them back later, you know
but, I don't answer, I mean, if I'm with someone, unless it's something important, or if it's going to be a short call, then we can agree something, but if I'm with someone, then I really never answer the phone.
well, I live on my own so I have lots of time, when I'm alone, to talk on the phone, alone
exactly
and I, I think that when you are with someone, you should actually pay attention to that person, kind of like it used to be when there were no cellphones and one would talk on the phone only at home, not in the street
exactly
I mean, I don't know, it's a bit, it's a bit of an addiction that people have to be connected all the time
exactly and one can't
I mean, by email too, I mean people have their blackberries and they are connected all the time, they answer emails, I don't really understand what can be so urgent that you send it by email.
you can't answer it later, when you are at home in front of your computer?
yes, that's true, I think  people, as you say, are addicted to it, they always have to answer the phone whenever it rigns.
um
and that's even when they don't even speak for a whole minute but they have to answer it whenever it rings.
um ha
but not me, I answer when I'm somewhere where I can really talk to that person but if I'm
I'm doing something, cooking or reading a book to my daughter, well I let it ring
uhm uhm
And then I cal it back, look ma'am sorry, or look, doe, sorry
Of course, of course that makes sense, also now with cellphones you can see who's calling, so if it's I don't know, I mean if I'm going to see my friend tomorrow
And my friend is calling me, well I'll answer it because I know we have to agree for the next day
Exactly
But if it's someone else I'll call them later, I mean I don't know, I mean I think it's about having a little bit of common sense, but people think that always. Other thing is that teenagers, I'm a teacher, teenagers
love the cellphones, they always carry them, there's always a cellphone ringing in class, I mean I don't know how many times has a cellphone ringing in my class
Yeah, I know
And I say, they're at school not for answering their phone but for learning
Exactly
Also they're there with all their friends, I don't know who is calling I mean one imagine, eh, they're at high school but one imagine that most of the
teenagers in high school they're friends, they're also at the same school
It's assumed so
I mean because, those phones are being ringed, are the fathers ringing, I don't think so
No, exactly but, aha mom, my mom is a teacher too and she goes through that a lot
Uhm and what does she teach? your mom, to
She teaches Spanish in high school too
Oh yes yes, I teach English, English for the immigrants
Oh, ESL
ESL , so
okay, but my, my daughter had bad luck with me, because she's going to say that I'm old fashioned or whatever because she's not going to have a cell phone
at twelve or thirteen years old she's not going to be everywhere carrying a cell phone
no, twelve or thirteen no, because some of my students already are like seventeen, eighteen, are grown enough
Oh yes but I, I have seen kids that are about twelve, thirteen, you know, are going to seventh, eight grade and it seems that as they are already grown
they want to be older, so they put a lot of pressure on their parents and the parents give them the cell phones
um um
and I don't believe in that
yes, yes
when she is seventeen I will buy her a cell phone and that's it
yes
and that is to call me
Ans do you have only one daughter?
yes only, I'm a single mother
OK
and then, she is the only one I have so far
but well, you are taking good care of her
yes the same with the playstations and that stuff, I tell her no, no
Hellow!, My name is Gloria
Good evening, how are you?, I'm Norma, from here in Atlanta,
Oh! Good, and you?
We meet again, right?
aha, see, last night I spoke to another lady lady that sounded like you, but she was from Philadelphia.
aha
Her name was Silvia and we talked about the same, we talked about the cell phone.
Ah, yes
yes
mhm
and do you remember about the cell phone?
what did you say?
We need to talk about the cell phone.
yes, yes
About cell phones.
aha
and do you like it?
Well,
do you agree that people drive and speak?
ah, well no, I don't agree that they should be driving and speaking, that's very dangerous, I don't know, they could get distracted, bring, or they give them some bad news
I don't know, they're in shock, and there's, there's going to be accidents because of that, no?
yeah
No, but I mean, somewhere else. On the other hand, cell phones have become necessary. In case of emergency, if something happens sometimes you can't find the phone
but you have your cell phone close by
yeah, yeah
And what do you think?
I don't like it, I don't drive and talk on the phone, I yell at people who drive and talk on the phone, I go crazy
yeah
because they don't pay attention, they're on the phone and they're not paying attention, if they obeyed the traffic light or not, or
yeah
or, they're arguing. Once I was with my friend, and her husband was arguing with her, and I said, hang up. Hang up on him, you're going, you're going to kill me because of that argument
yeah
And now kids sometimes use them at school. We have to take them away. Cell phones at schools are a bother, they lose them, we have to look for them
we have to tag them, they go crazy, as if they're the last bill in the pocket. And sometimes they don't respect, they don't respect the teachers
Teachers tell them to turn them off, they don't do it and put them in vibration mode. It's a bother, a big bother, especially at school
All those kids, and they lose them, we collect like 20 or 25 phones, even after we tell them not to bring them to school
They still bring them
sure
they still bring them
sure, that shouldn't be, I mean I agree if it's in case of emergency
Exactly.
And there's nothing, but for example, in school, the children don't need cellphones.
Exactly.
No, they are going to study, not to phone their friends, to study
aha,
No, and when you are driving, well that's really dangerous, that you know, they drive and speak on the phone.
Exactly
yes, it's like they say, they don't pay attention. No, but it's also convenient, right? It has some advantages and disadvantages.
yes, sure, that's right but yes, you know, I once told a mom: You know, you can't send the boy to school with a cellphone
Ah, but she was like, that's how I can get in touch with him and I said: "He can use the office phone, anytime he wants"
Yes, like in an emergency, you can call him and they go look for him,
Sure
And she said: No, do you really think, do you really think that I bought him the phone so that he would leave it on the boudoir?", and this and that, and I said: "Look
so, I'm going to tell the principal so that they remove the phone because, one of the regulations of the school is that they can't bring cellphones
they can't bring them, he's not, you can't send him with one, you are responsible for him getting scolded. And they still don't talk to them, they have to do it
that's wrong, so that they won't do it again.
Sure, I mean, parents are responsible, as the saying goes: Education starts at home, right?
eh, yes, yes, yes
Children or parents are not getting education, they are not teaching their kids good manners
aha
Or do things that are appropriately.
ha
Not even kids go, they don't go to learn, they don go to understand
exactly, yeah
mhm
lets see what else, i am tired of weekend parties, and I'm tired of being simply tired. and let me tell you
let me tell you, i had a party yesterday
hmh
and, she told me she would get here later right, cause she didn't find the place, she called me like fifteen times.
in less than three minutes.
oh my god
and i let the cell phone ring i said: I'm not going to let this women to cause me an accident.
ha
so that i can get to their party easily, and i was close to their house, and she said to go to the other place.
oh yeah
yeah, then two blocks later, she said no its on the other side, and then later i said: I'm not going to listen to her.
I'm going to go through the instructions i got from the internet.
ha
and then i got there easily, I'm not gonna call her next time, because she was driving me crazy with her cell phone.
oh yeah, now people are that way
Oh my God.
A lot of times they're addicted to the cellphone
Yes, yes, yes
Oh, if nothing happens, they pick up their cellphone to see, to look for someone to talk to
Yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true. My husband, my husband says to me: "Oh, always, i will not buy you a new cellphone because you always leave it here"
Can you believe, you have to carry it like it was your purse, and i say: I'm not going to carry it like my purse because
I, the, my baby is the most important for me and he's at school, and if something happens to him there, they'll call me
Sure
And if something happens to you, he calls me an ambulance, ¿why would i have a cellphone?, yeah, we once saw an accident on the highway
you know, so it's good then
Of course, like for certain, i mean, like for emergencies, ¿right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Really, uh, a lot of times you don't need it. But many times there are things that you really don't, you don't need; for example, there were no cellphones before, cellphones that you
a few years back there were no cellphones, there was no internet or something
I know, ¿right?
you were living fine then, you really didn't miss, miss anything
Right
No, it's like, if, since we live in a consuming society, well, that's why
Yes
Many times all the advertising, all the marketing, i don't know
Right
They make us think that we really need something, that yeah, we really need it
yeah, yeah, exactly, and how they do it, that's another thing
Uh um
That every baby has to have that music, about the noise and all that, ¡oh my God!, and in the movies, even in the movies, he spoke about how we had to talk about
that if they use it in the movies; in the movies they also start singing and they screw your movie when you go to the theater.
Now, I'm not saying i go, i'm tired of hearing everybody talking on their cellphones, on the movie, they, on the train too, on the train, like it was
was their home
Oh, on the train, yeah
You hear, you hear all the conversation, all the conversation of the one next to you and the one in front of you
I don't like it, i don't like it there either. I put my cellphone in vibrate and whoever calls me has to wait for me to
get down from the train. I'm a maniac, my friends tell me: "Aw, Gloria, what's wrong with you?", and i say: "Look, you go to the Highway"
"you're going at fifty and you're talking, i don't think you can be aware of the conversation and the road". I find it very odd, because when i
I don't drive on the highway, but when i drive i have to have my mind on the highway, i can't be talking to someone
over the phone, ¡Oh my God!, it drives me crazy, the phone, that cellphone drives me crazy.
Sure, yeah, really, now everybody has a cellphone. Everybody goes around with their
I know
cellphone talking, talking from here to there
I know, i know, i didn't let my baby take it to school, he has it for emergencies only.
No
Then he says to me: Mommy but if an emergency happens, then I tell you: You go and as I work in the school they leave you to call me.
They now know that you are my son,
Mh
they let you call me. You know, but the telephone we rule that everyone so that they don't bring the cellphones and still
They ignore it, and you tell them not to use them and they're in the hallway They go to the bathroom,
Ah, yes
In the hallway They go behind the door, oh horrible, these horrible children, nowadays. Oh my God horrible. Even in the church, today in the church a poor lady
Of course, it's a child, uh huh
her cellphone rang as if it were a bell. And even the priest when he was praying stopped. And said: what's that, a door?
And he made it like a joke
Ah, of course
but and he made it like a joke, then he said that when one comes to the church it's to pray, not to for asking to play with the cellphone
So, she felt bad and she went outside. Afterwards when she went outside and the cellphone started to ring again, and everyone, everyone started to laugh
because this lady was now, I said Ay, that she's fenced in now interrupting the concentration that you have in the church. You know, so
Of course, yes, we when we go to the temple, our temple, also there
uh huh
No, there it's eh, people have their cellphones and before starting the call there to prayer, ah he tells them please turn off your cellphones so they don't interrupt,
uh huh and the people still don't turn it off, right?
yes, some turn it off, no? but some no still there the
Some turn it off
they have and sometimes it sounds, no?
I know, it's disrespectful, right?
Yes, really
It's like adults don't listen, that's why children don't listen either
hmmm
Because they follow the roles of mom and dad, you know, I'm so tired, now I'm, I'm helping my son with his homework
Ah, okay
We're writing, having breakfast too, he has to write eight sentences about cellphones, why does he have a cellphone, and can he live without a cellphone and can he use a cellphone at the movies
if he can use it when he goes dancing, if this or that, they also use it for games, now I'm using the cell phone as a calculator
Ah, yes
Because I can use it as a calculator. And the other, oh, it has a good thing, I put my appointments in the cell phone
Ah, that could be true
yes, the only bad thing is that if I can't find my cellphone later, I don't remember, and I set a beep so it reminds me
I have an appointment today, in that sense is good, yes
yes, in some things, no? that's good, no?
yes, I'm carrying it, yes
But too much addiction is too much
I know
yes, really
anyway, keep talking because I'm tired. Oh, my God, have you called a lot? has it been a lot of calls? Have you called, or they always call you?
Well every day well they call me, I have not made calls.
Oh, because you can make them too, you know?
yes, me too, I know but I don't, I
aha
I don't do, they call me every day, because, it's only there is a number of calls that you make
Exactly
No, you can only make twenty five calls, no more
And you cannot be or the twenty five, everybody can always call you, yo don't have to call?
I su- suppose to I don't know, ah, because to me yes
Oh,
they always call me, every day, since the beginning of the study
Oh, they call you every day, oh, that's good
yes, they call me every day.
Oh, that's good, that's good
And one day, and one day they made, what do I know, tow calls
oh, me too
Well, yesterday, yesterday no, yesterday, a day on Friday I lost a call because I wasn't, they called and I wasn't in
aha
here, afterwards they didn't call again
yes, I lost, I lost a few, but I told them that I was here certain days ans sometimes I'm not in, sometimes I am in.
mhm
And the machine, they leave a message in the machine they leave there, I lost the call, oh, that they call again and sometimes they call again.
Because I tell them that I'm here late like until eleven. So they call late. Many times they call late.
Hello, hello, with who am I speaking
Hi, good afternoon I am Lorena
Much love Lorena you are speaking with Lina
Paulina how's it going? How are you?
good, hey I know that you didn't here that there was a theme
the same that I was going to question but I didn't listen well I think that it it wasn't very clearly, and was highly intended for the internet.
oh something for the internet if that's what's up then my husband was there
of it
pressing the button and he told me to take my turn and I didn't hear anything
no no but but this does not remain clear this I attended.
yes, I don't have an accent, a very strong accent
and I don't really listen and if it includes this it is rather difficult, hard
yes
this and doing all of the points before you have to call bu the last advantage that was said was something about how many have been.
I see
your most important dates in life and I intended and which I don't know are less important and while I say something on the internet that's your opinion.
I see
what are the advantages and disadvantages
and disadvantages of using the internet
to use the internet and finally say that that is also your opinion and talk with them the best we can to begin to know the people for the middle is now.

ah, sure
there were students from all Latin America, and well, there was always an occasion for the Chilean friend, the Argentinian friend to invite us to eat some of their foods

oh
yes this is interesting, right? i mean i didn't understand him,
yes
at first, and now hes been talking, he really is
well,
whats the importance of talking right?
yes
because, in this life, with different things, different careers, nobody actually calls by phone anymore to say hi to a few friends, right?
there's no time, yes
so then, one needs value, that the important thing.
and apart from that, one has to meet the people as well.
yes yes yes yes yes
a little bit more,
but to dedicate a few minutes cleaning things, for example to call by phone is always like, this is important
do you make your time usable?
ha ha
now that kids are in bed,
yes
well, there's one that i have to put in bed, hes always circling around.
Yes
Yes, that's important
Yes, and well this about the internet is other question, and well its marvelous
Do you use it a lot?
No, but my chldren and specially the youngest it's always connected
yes
And the most important is that computers are a marvelous thing, right?
yes, but
They make information accessible
Oh, the information
And, well, old printed encyclopedias become decoration objects
It's always good to have it near, but
yes, they are nice
Internet can be helpful but also bad, because like you said, it has good and bad information, right?
bad information, well, we know things about
pornography and all those things
exactly, scary thing, right?
You have to be wisely, but
yes
but it's incredible communicate with someone or learning about anything
yes or somebody in Chile can send an email or something like that, right?
yes
those parents too
like you just said, encyclopedias, you can access so many things
yes, yes, yes, you go online and search for a recipe, a prescription or a natural remedy
yes
microbiology, physics even, whatever you want, no?
that's true, and now that I'm here, I mean I wasn't used to cooking that much when I was younger
yes, aha
and now I go online and copy pastry recipes or whatever, you just go online and get recipes
aha, exactly and it's as easy as that, right? I remember when
yes
the other day, I wanted to cook some squash pie, right, for Halloween
yes
and I found like thirty five different recipes.
yes
well, you can pick the one you like and cook it
just cook and cook
yes, and how was it?
the other one said it was about meeting someone on the phone or on the Internet
if not for this means that we have known. the telephone calls and all
oh ah yes we already talked about that no?
yeah well I have loved it for real it has resulted new,is incredible
yes
well like they are trying to stick on us that the telephone is useful and important no?
YES
to talk to people
how did you know about this project?
My daughter in Univesity of Pennsylvania
oh you should is that university no?
yes you as well
eh no my husband he participated on another project they had last year
yeah
then this year they sent him and email and told him they were doing this project
ah okay
and if you are ahh if your native language is Spanish participate then he sent it to me and he said well he is nothamerican well but he speaks very well
but he said I am not a native so you go you participate
that was good hey talking about that
and I sent it, ah
the other day I spoke to a man that lives in New York but his parents are Puerto Ricans
OK
that's difficult to understand ehh and I don't tell you that I have any problem as we speak and saying and they delete letters and change the wording
too fast
and they talk really fast, what a job he told me and the same person that started the call, no?
yes, but he has yes
no but simply
yes I already talked with them, I gave them my comments  and told them that at least
somebody must speak really good Spanish
write hi, he, he it's true that he is reading at least because because he says something eh when the time is over
yes
ah, it says time is upward
yes
time is up, and i say that it's like
yes, yes, for example when you ask for holding in the line
yes
how do people say...?, i forgot it..hold on
It mix both of them and it's impossible to understand
Yes!, yes!
I claimed those things, and I said that they don't have to read it again
It's fine to say those things, I haven't said that, just thought about it
And change, I spoke to the project manager, he called home, and he said it's really bad
said that he is getting someone who speaks Spanish and working to get the recording
Yes, i see
Because you can't understand him, one day i had to hear it twice
Of course
Because i wasn't understanding what he was saying about going somewhere
me neither, and finally you can't hear that word
you press any number because i don't
I press number four, because i understood that, right?, that was a cordless phone
yes
I hope i was right, if not, well, i passed this test. So, hey, do you have many family at Chile, all your relatives
Hello?
Good evening, my name is, I live in Connecticut
This is Annie, in Miami, we spoke before.
Oh, Miami, oh, and how are you?
Good, and you?
good, thanks, and the baby sleeping?
That's good. yes, thanks to God
you will have a break at least.
yes, just a few minutes ago she felt asleep.
oh, good.
and how are you?
good. Watching, watching a program on TV, that I like to watch on Wednesday.
Oh, that's good. I am getting a cold, I have very bad pain in my throat.
Oh, I have allergies, but, besides that, well, I have taken vitamins so it can go away.
That is what you say, but, since I am pregnant, I can`t take a lot of
oh,
For this reason, I am, you know. I am not feeling too well.
No,
But,
Ah
anyway, I
The conversation is about the internet. Do you use the internet?
I use it, that's like my, I use it every day. There, we, eh, you know, we have e-mail, we have, eh, eh, we do everything we need to do with the bank,
I search for information, recipes, I go to the library.
Mm.
I don't buy much, but, if we are going to buy something, I always do like, eh, research.
Aha, aha.
Eh, searching for the products, to see where I find the best price. So, the internet, for us is, is, is like, you know, having an
encyclopedia, let's say,
Mm.
at home.
yes, is good. I - I like- I use it also to look for jobs, to look for information, for my daughter for school. But, for
things of, searching for people on the internet, I don't like it.
No, me neither.
I don't believe in, in, in that- I think you find, there are many crazy people, much, too much of that garbage, that they put on the internet, and
then it turns out to be something that is not. There's been a lot of people that have used it, and, and they've gotten married and everything, But I, I've never gotten into,
Well, I
in the chat rooms they talk about.
yes. Eh, and,
I've never talked to anybody.
I, before, eh, I got in, in chat rooms.  But, they were not to, to, you know, to find people, I mean, they were about different topics.
But, no, it was nothing, eh, you know, after a while, I didn't like it.  Because people like that you, I don't now, like they said things that,
that l-
It was not true.
yes, or, or normally they don't say, you know, like the got ugly,
Aha. Aha, aha.
and I didn't like it at all.  So, after a while, like one or two months, I stopped going.  But, because I prefer to talk to people, no, you know,
being there in- in, in front of a machine.
Aha, aha.
But, you know, I have a
And, that I- that, that also has brought many problems to couples, I find.
yes.
Because, it has separated many couples where the husbands start at, or the women, they start on the internet and they meet people and they, they spend hours there, and hours, and hours, and lost hours on the, on the internet site.
I don't, I use it there, but, my niece sends me pranks and she sends me jokes from Puerto Rico, and, and, my son sends me the pictures of the baby, the new baby, that's why I like the services so much.
Because, I can see my granddaughter all the time and, and know who she is every month.
yes, it is- something that we also do.  We take pictures of the girl, and we send them to all our friends, the friends, and all the, well, not every month any more, but, earlier it used to be every month.
Aha, aha.
And, and I like that a lot because, that way, at least people we know, the family who is far from us, they can see how she is growing.
yes that is it, that is something we do a lot, I had forgotten about the pictures.
yes, the picture is a, it is, it is something nice, I love them.  But, also, eh, what I don't like to much, which you were saying, you know that you send pictures and they save them like in a
file it for a certain time, then after, that that, I think after six, or something like that it it, does apparently delete them the, the
the program looks like it erases it if you don't remove it.
Well, our little girl has close to 2 years with us and this has never ever come up, the pictures are there. It all depends you know,
on what you are using. But, we still have pictures in the internet, of of long ago, of my baby shower.
Ah, then whenever, I don't, I do retouch them, then I leave them in the computer, and I place them on a CD,
Ah, very pret(Pretty)-fine.
and I place the date and we put it on a, I create a label, then, that's how I have them. If one of my family member comes, we get them on the television and the computer.
Ah, how good, that's a good idea.
Fine, fine, yes why, em, if you leave them on the computer. that will will use up your megabytes, I think.
Well, I always make copies, before placing them into the the the computer,
Fine.
Oh, excuse me,in the internet, I always make copies and place them on a CD, and all of that.
Uhm.
Then,so, I have the originals, which cu took. We take a  hundred plus hundreds each month.
Fine.
But, I only place, let's say, thirty or forty on the internet. Then, I ke-keep the originals and place them on the internet, because the ones on the internet are the ones that are already,
you know, touched up, you know, the-the best. So, I always have two, tow kinds of -CDs So, if she, if she wants the pictures when she grows up, I can look out for her, look, these are the best, and these are are the originals, whatever you'd like.
Fine, Yeah.
In that way she has them. But
Yes.
I had never thought about putting it in the television.
yes, you can do it, you can but you have to, I think, you have to program the CD, to be able to watch it on the TV. So, you need to buy a cable, I think that most cameras have one and
yes.
and you, and you, you have to connect it to the television. That's what we do every time we have a party, we put it on.
the CD. Then, when our family comes over, we gather around the television, in the living room and we watch it from there, it looks say better
Mhm, eh, eh, yes, that's a great idea!
because the screen is bigger too. You put the music on,
yes.
well, it, it looks nicer. That's why I like the Internet, but, for all the other couple stuff, I don't like that.
Me neither. That's, as you said, you know, you never know who you are going to meet.
No, but, you see all these kids that are taken away, it's like, they meet crazy people in the Internet.
yes.
That happened to a girl from around here, a guy was courting her, he was not from New Jersey, he was around forty years old and the girl was around fifteen!
and he took her. Luckily they caught him on time, but God knows what would've happened had he taken her and killed her. And, I don't like kids to use it, only sometimes.
Neither do I, that's, I mean, I don't know anymore, you know, my kid, he's, when he's older he will use the computer and
I will have to change it to another room because we currently have it in one, it's kind of an office, let's call it that, that's how we are calling it
And,
it's a small room that we use as an office.
yes, but, I want to place it, let's say, in the living room, or, you know, somewhere where I could watch them while they are using it, so that I can see them
and see what they are doing, because, I used to be a teacher, I know, you know, all the things that children do.
Hmm,hmm
how they hide from the parents, and stuff like that, and I don't
Yeah
don't want to imply that my dau-
yes, when you are around, they change the screen, what can you do? Sometimes I tell my grandchildren, what are you doing? no nothing, nothing
yes, it's
and I open the other screen, what do you have there, let's see
so
you have to watch them closely, because the computer is a little, it has a lot of advantages but also disadvantages
Ah
Because, look, all that information it provides for these, these terrorists to learn to make bombs. Even those students, those that killed all that people in Columbine School
yes
They got their ideas from the Internet. So, sometimes, I mean, it has a good side, like everything. Like everything they make, it has good points, and then it has other points that
they're disastrous
It all depends on how you use it, you know? yes, I, I, I love internet, but I also know when to
you know, if you begin to, if you begin, but, when children begin to use it, it has to be a little different
Yeah, yeah
you know. Because, I think sometimes they don't
yes, now, well, there are many things for parental control and all that stuff
yes
that, at least, one, well, with that can control them a little more than before. But, at the beginning that there had been none of that, well, you know that the little children get into, in the chat rooms, eh, they open twenty thousand things.
Well, and, and still that, that happens, even though they have the parental controls. Because, many times, when I go to, to look for my e-mail, you know, I know that this happened to, to some of my students, that they are going to open the e-mail,
and photos are turning up of, you know, naked women, whatever.
Mhm.
And, and that is something that, that bothers me a lot, that I don't know how it is that can be changed. You know?
Ah, it's, it's people that, eh, when s- I think that if you leave the, the password, and don't close the, when you are going to read the mail,
if you don't close well the, fast lo- or, let's suppose, you, you are going to cook or do something, and you leave it there, an open space,
many, there are many men that, many people that know how to grab your, to grab your password of that moment that you are there left for, for, for a long time, for that it tells you that so quickly
you are going to leave the computer, well, you grab and you close it. Do you understand me? To assure that nobody grabs your information. Well, then, they what they do, that now when they grab your password, they come and they start to send
d- those, e-mails that, that, sometimes, what they carry are viruses, sometimes that which they carry are filth.
yes.
So, everything depends on, that is, at least you have to have a lot of carefulness with the, with the passwords, and with the information, especially that of the bank and all that
when sometimes they send you to ask information, that you, that they tell you put in your pin again because,
yes.
there, one has to be careful.
NO, thank God, we, you know, things like that on the computer no, that hasn't happened to us. But, someone yes was stolen the, the number of, of
social security
Uh huh.
of my husband a few years ago. And, we had a, many problems.
Ah, yes, well, that is the, he stole the identity. Well, that is being used a lot now in,
Because,
through the Internet they steal the, the, the whole identity. That's why, when, you know sometimes, they tell you to take, what do I know, something for free, they offer you twenty things for free on the Internet. And you go ahead and start filling it out. And then,
when they start asking your information of your, your mother's maiden name, birth date and all those things, well, it's not good to give that information.
Hello, good night
Hi, good night eh, I'm Nicole, Speaking from New York
Ay I'm Norma from here in atlanta, Georgia
hi, how are you?
fine, and you?
fine, fine, we talked before or not
Um, i don't know
No, no, I spoke with someone from Atlanta
uh, yes
But, i don't know
mhm
from what country are you?
i'm, I'm Peruvian
ah ok, eh
and you?
me, well, my family is Cuban
uh
eh but i was born here in the United States
ah, Ok, and so,  you think about nol?
about telemarketing, I don't like, i don't know who likes that
Yes
that people calls them to sell whatever, uh, i don't know
No, it's, it's referring to, it's referring to telemarketing, that thing that looks like pop-ups on the internet, or that, they call you on the phone.
Uh, no, i think they're talking about when they call you.
Oh, when they call you over the phone.
That when they call you on the phone, and they sell you stuff, and also when
Oh
When they send you emails.
Oh, spam, yeah
They sell, right, spam
Right
So, i don't know, i don't know if that's convincing to anyone, i have never bought anything or looked at an email like that, seriously.
Right
And, i don't know
Oh, me neither. I don't think that, that I've bought things over the internet, i haven't bought things over the internet, online.
Yeah, uh, I've bought things over the internet, but not
not what they send you in spam
Right
No, no, other things you really need, no
Right, right, well, it should be cash
No, and
it must be someone that sees those emails and is convinced, because if not
yes, sure, surely there are people that invest in that, not for themselves like that. Per, eh, they worry about sending all those emails and the
um
and the small companies or, who knows who does that, then, they invest money doing that.
sure
Sure, no, and that, by phone, yes by phone, yes really it's bothersome specially when you're busy
mhm, sure
aha, bothersome
I don't know if if you have tried using those lists that say not to call
aha
I mean there is like, you can register on a list and with that they're not supposed to call your number, or they stop calling you, but I don't know
I am registered anyways, they call me sometimes
yes, for sure.
But not so much, not so much as before
mhm yes sure, no, sometimes, no and people sometimes that sell are very insistant
Um, yes, well, I always say, ah, no, like that, like that I can't can't speak now, I can't speak now and I hang up. So, I don't I don't really want to hear the story, that they're going to tell me because I know that I won't
aha
I won't buy
Sure that you're not interested
mm
yes sometimes there are people, and sometimes there are what you call them scams that they call them, that they sell something and sometimes at the end it's not true, those things also happen
yes yes, yes also
fraudulent things that they offer
yes
the offer to sell by phone, even by Internet too
yes, it must be a terrible job to have that job, my sister did it for about a week
Ah, yes, yes, many families there that worked
and she arrived every day at home crying because everybody
nobody wanted to buy
sure, no, nobody wants to listen, I mean
yes, without even listening.
I mean everybody hangs up on you, and she use to come back so upset that she stopped working there after a week
Sure, really it's a job that's very, it's not very no, not very rewarding that we can say, it's more the bitterness
no, also they pressure you, when you have a job like that they pressure you ah,
sure
ah, to make sales, I mean the are like like listening to you, while you make the call the bosses are listening in
yes
to see how you're selling and if you're not
they pay by commission for sure.
sure it is very effective very effective they throw you or pay you less that is a bad job,sometimes I feel a little bad for the persons
yes sometimes we thing,well it is a job that they do like any other job no
sure sure like how like they also are trying to make money but I do not want to give them my money that is the problem
mhm mhm
em don't know what is,is that I answer surveys,ose yes yes they call me with surveys that is i want to know
yeah
that if I will vote and for whom, what do I THINK ABOUT THE POLITICAL situation today,that I do answer in the surveys.
mhm
I believe that is good eh,to have one or I mean a diversity of opinions
sure
and I like to contribute to something, because it is for investigations or for
mm like research
sure but,but they are not asking me for money,only answers ,opinions silver no eh
sure because today we never really know who it is no,really who is lying
sure sure,also i do not want,what they are selling me, the news I don't want or sea now o sea I read the news in the internet
and I do not want newspaper in my house
yes
eh and I do not know what else they sell me life insurance, I do not want
insurance,vacations
mhm, that you won a car
yes that, that's really
that you just have to go to Miami to look for it
yea or that you won this much but they have to send a certain amount of money to assure your prize.
right
A matter
Right, no the majority of those things
mhm
they're all just to make money, because if it weren't for that they wouldn't be winning.
right
someone has to pay those peoples' salaries
yes you really have to be quite careful and not
mm right, that's the other thing that sometimes
no
they call and say they hav- they leave you a message and tell you that you have to call some number to get your prize
yes
and it turns out the number is one that if you call it you get charged
mm
I mean it's like those nine hundred numbers a nine hundred that, they charge you money for calling so
ah, and plus everyone has to pay long distance yea really you have to be pretty careful aside from that. No but paying a lot of people because they want more business
mm
Not that - a way of publicity that they say.
I think it's cheap, I mean I believe it's cheap for the company to do this kind of publicity, I mean surely they pay a little
to the people that are calling
yes
in fact sometimes the people that is calling us is not even here in the United States
o yes, yes, that is true
but they have like communication systems
mhm
that allows people to call you from India
o yes fair
and one doesn't notice, how they speak English in India
yes of the accent they have
I mean, how they do it like outsourcing
yes
how do they pay the people in those countries, to call you, to sell you things, can you imagine?
um
the few that that people is getting paid
of course because in India they don't pay much, that is why
they are making the phone calls so if they do one or two sales per person, they are making money that is why they do it, because they can't
I mean, they must not sell much like that. But since they pay little to the employees they must earn a little because of that
sure because in India, it's a different way of life. You have to pay there, they pay very little wages to the people
Sure, it's a poor country
aha. So, these people are anxious for work, to get any job, they don't
um I heard once that, when you call a help desk, when you have a problem with your computer, you call a help number and many times, the people answering those calls are in India.
yes, that's true, even here in the big, for example, the telecommunications company here in the South, Bell South
mhm
No, every time my husband calls, or every time I call because there is a problem with our telephone, with the Internet, so you call and the people that answer the phone are in India
sure, and sometimes the reception is pretty bad
no, yes, mhm, sure and you can't even understand what they are saying because they don't speak
clearly or sometimes there's a delay so you can't hear
mhm mhm
anyway, that's really bad, I mean I'm calling the phone company and their communication system is awful,  that's unbelievable!
Sure, now yes
it's inconceivable! and also with the time zones, there must be like a twelve hour difference with India
so I guess, most of those people work full time, no
Sure, or work night shifts
Or work, yes, night shifts
I'm quite sure people calls them during the day more often than during the nights so it must be night for them, they are working night shifts
I mean, if it's three o'clock here
yes, kind of mhm
Well, it might be worth it for those people, maybe it's better that those other works
Of course, let's see what else we can say to complete the 12 minutes
sure, it's a little hard to talk a lot about this subject. Sometimes the given topics are
mhm
there is not much to say
Of course, since last time someone called because of the appointments.
yes,
that it called schedule
schedule, that because it was translated from English
yes is a
is a machine that is translating from English to Spanish
is a question, is not a question, I said, what is schedule, I did not understand very well
to schedule, I also, I was also listening to schedule, what was it about schedule
yes
and then I thought in English, date must mean dating, to schedule
yes, instead of dating
how, how careless, or rather, a language study
oh yeah
is is supposed to be a linguistics study.
of course
And the words can't be translated to Spanish
Of course, of course, that is that is best.  Not even the complete translation or the appropriate
of course, no, is a machine, is a ma-
hello
hello, good afternoon
hello, good afternoon, it's me, Nicole from New York
ah, I'm Norma from Atlanta, Georgia
Hello, how are you?
I'm fine and you? We spoke yesterday, right?
no, not yesterday because I didn't get any calls yesterday, but I think we've spoken before.

yes, yes, I think we spoke about it
yes, we did, I think it was last Friday
aha
we spoke of that subject, it's stupid
aha
what else are we to say!
yes, that's what I was thinking!
well, let's speak about something else because, what else have we left to say? We are not having the same conversation as before.
sure, I don't think nobody agrees with sales through television
no, eh, you are Peruvian?
yes, I'm Peruvian
ah, ok, and how much, how long are you living here?
ten years, aha
ten years and, do you have family here? or
no, no, no, I sa- s- vin- I came for no but the temple where I belong
aha
there is no, but the religious association to which I belong hte, I came because of them
ah, OK

yes, yes I imagine I, I was grew up with my sister, I mean, two girls so
ah, you have
I don´t know how they are
ah, you are not married, are you?
no, no yet
ah, aha
I live, I live by myself, close to my parents
ah OK
mm
ah, he is there, right? in
I am 27 years old
ah, see, I am forty one
yes not for me, I mean I would like a lot to have a family, get married and have a family, but
mm
I don't know, until now no,
doesn't appear, the right person
no, the same I don't know my boyfriend the same, I mean, we get along well perhaps
mm
but we've been together a year, I mean, we met a year ago
mm
therefore we are waiting a little
mm
but perhaps yes I hope that yes,
yes, you are still young
yes, same with him
yes well, when you get married is different, is
sure
no and you have like more obligations
sure
is not the same freedom as before specially if you have kids
sure sure, no I like to live alone, sometimes is a little lonely, I like to go out, do things
mm
see other people because if not, is like too lonely but I don't know, everything at the right time, I believe
sure, that's true but on standstill or have you already decided
sure
no next to a bit more of her or deprive themselves of a bit more of their liberty I suppose that it must be that way, no?
sure, because, because it's too much work and when you have a family it's already too much work
yes
and I, I like being on my own, like that I say I, I like, I like the peacefulness I like to think and to read
mhm
I think that when, when I have kids
mm
hmm, then it will be very difficult to do those things
oh, that's very true, you're very right there,
so that
when the the kids are small are babies and hmm no, one doesn't have time even for eat- ever for eating or even to shower
sure sure I went to visit a friend that has a daughter
aha
the daughter is like, like six weeks old,
ah, yes, a little baby
I mean very little and, I don't know my friend with the, with the baby always, I mean, she doesn't leave her
sure, little babies are like that, exactly, mhm
I mean, she's with her at every moment, but she, she is very happy but, it's an enormous responsibility until they grow up a bit,

Ah, I am of the Hare Krishna movement
oh, look, yes
I don't know if you have heard
yes, I studied in the, in the university I studied Buddhism that
mm
is like the same, it has similar things, doesn't it?
mm, yes, yes, we are vegetarians there's no
and in Peru there's also Hari Krishna?, there must be
oh, yes? yes there are many temples in Peru, in, around the world there are many temples
mm and the, are the kids vegetarians also, or no?
oh, yes of course
there is,
and they are vegetarians since the womb
and they never ask to eat meat?
no, no there is- the
no?
up to now no, so, when they are little no, they are little and they still don't teach them to be vegetarians
of course
if not, they don't ask or have any inclination, when they are adolescents already, when they start to, to I don't know? to ask, nobody can force them to to do something they don't want to do no? and is a matter of them
of course mm
they have, they are not kids, they have free will when they get older and
Sure, sure
No, they have to choose or see for themselves
Yes, I was a vegetarian for a while
Were you? Huh
Been a vegetarian for ten years, but then I went to Chile and I was living with a boyfriend there and it was hard to keep being a vegetarian be...
Hmm
...cause, he ate steak and I prepared vegetarian stuff
Oh
And he put like a- a piece of steak in the middle, I kind of didn't want to eat like that
Yeah?
So I stopped, I stopped there because it was too complicated, and then I came back and kept on it but I'm not eating much steak, I eat
Aham
Very, v- I never cook steak at home, just
When you have a meal
Exactly, if I eat outside or I go to someone else's house and they prepare something, then sure, but at home, only vegetables and, I don't know, legume
I like it, hmm, I prefer to eat like this
Hmm
I mean
Sure, it's like, more healthy, right?
Hmm
it is more healthy and even its more digestive
mm yes, truth is that no, I do not like meat very much, I like fish
mhm
I don't know you eat fish or not?
No, no, we do not eat meat, eggs or fish
no, fish no, but meat per se no, It do not like it much
no and you are still with the same boyfriend?
no, no we split up
ah ok, now all of a sudden the other, the other boyfriend is there suggest him all of a sudden, he is not inclined to eat meat, and you make him a vegetarian you have it easier your a vegetarian
yes I have never had a relationship with someone who is a vegetarian, never
mhm
and, and I have had like five boyfriends
aham
something like, serious boyfriends
aham
so to speak, more or less serious
aham
but all of them eat meat, and they were like they liked meat, even the actual one, too
aham
he likes hamburguers and chicken
well, some people feel leaning, well  it is like a habit. they were born and grew like that right?
mm, sure
grew up eating meat and don't know that there is another alternative, suddenly hear something, but never imagined how is it like, right?
mm
to be a vegetarian, really has nothing to, nothing to envy to people who eat meat, I have been a vegetarian for about twenty years
mm
no, and and really one feels very well , it is very healthy,right, You don't even show your real age.
sure,
if you are a vegetarian
if not, to me, I prefer because...
no, but it is different, aha.
...meat makes me feel like very full, like very heavy
sure it is very heavy for the digestion, human body is not adapted, right? to eat meat, it is not carnivore,
mm, but the people who are accustomed to eat meat, they feel like hungry if they do not eat meat
yes because,when you start been a vegetarian you don't know how to balance your eating.
mm, sure, you have to worry about having proteins.
Sure, so, you also have to find proteins to eat..
mm
...and find that you don't eat with meat
mm
tofu, no? soy, eh, different products, no? like that
sure and milk and yogurt and that, everything
ah, I, we drink it, we're lacto-vegetarians
yes, I see
no, yes, there are so many things you can eat while being a vegetarian, I mean, well, now that I'm a vegetarian, I want to eat them
I don't understand how people can eat meat
sure, sure, you get used to it
sure, and you eat such tasty foods, no? being a vegetarian you have absolutely nothing to be envious about
sure, I like it, and since I really really like Indian food, and they have a lot of vegetarian stuff
ah, yes
I like Asian food in general
hmm
Chinese food, Japanese food, well, I like that one, I like fish
ah, yes
but, eh, what else were you going to ask? I had another question but I forgot. Do your kids speak Spanish and english, or?
well, not so much, they speak, they know some words, they understand some spanish, no? but just a little
sure, sure, because with your husband you speak, speak in English
yes, it's not that dif- it's not that easy, no? I try to teach them spanish, but they speak English at school
hmm
especially the eldest
hmm
Hi, fine, fine, I'm Laya
Hi, how are you, aham, we want to talk about what, I didn't perfectly get the
Oh yeah we have to talk about spam, about unsolicited comercial advertising, about telemarketing, about yeah, sometimes they call home to sell you stuff or they send mails of they send emails, that kind of stuff.
Aha, no, because the phone we need to get another phone because the phone I have the volume I can't I have to uh turn the volume up
You can't hear me
Yeah I can hear you but I couldn't hear what the machine was saying
Yeah, also because the machine speaks Spanish badly
Yeah yeah well speaks Spanish with a Yankee accent, you see
Yeah, aside from the accent well a lot, I don't know a lot of things that really you can't understand but yeah
Well the situation also in spansish there are a lot of words and ah not only the words but of
expressions, yes yes yes, aham yes yes yes
from different countries, different regions, they say some things differently, you see because I'm here, here in New York and I was talking to
Puerto Ricans and they call oranges
aham, Chinese
chinese, yeah i can't take that because a Chinese is someone who comes from China
yes yes yes, yes yes yes, aham aham
A woman but that's coloquial so that's not their Spanish isn't it but the thing is that, okay we were talking about telemarketing right
yes, yes yes
Aham because I'm on a list of, I don't know if you know there's a list that you can put your name on
Aha, ahhhhh
with the government and they cant call if i still believe there's this list and i don't know where
okay, so i cant send to you publicity how you wish
they can send , but they cant call me
they cant call, okay haha
This start is how the one 2 1/2 , like the government uses this list , because they were complaining
Not a Spanish word
there are many called of rest and some hour's day , i hope to put my number in this list , do u understand?
and for the called that don't function
it isn't for requesting, but for don't pay my count if they call me
of course, if you are well, they wouldn't call you
if i don't pay my account , they go to call me for go to post office and make many things
ahaha , ahaha
i don't know if you have computer, but if you have they would go to send many things
well, it makes one year i live in USA, so i still believe there is many localities the enterprises of marketing call for telephone. In the true i don't receive many called those someone see me something or no
haha
and for e-mail is something but it s too much. For e-mail already is a matter. I have many accounts what it isn't good
of university is privacy and each day was removed  50.000 e-mails of publicity
mm
here it s chronological water, if soften , if treat and that's good everything
where are you from, did u said how long a time do u live in USA
I've a year on my own, yes, yes, I'm from Spain, from Barcelona
A year, wow, where do you come from? Ah, you're from Spain, yes, because I'm from Latin America, Hispanic
yes yes yes, then, ah, from Panama, very good, very good
yes, but in Panama, it's very commercial in Panama, a very small country, you know what I mean
yes, I was in Costa Rica last year, I was relatively close to Panama, I was in Costa Rica last year
yes, yes, but Panama is a lot more developed than Costa Rica, yes, there's a lot of
yes, no, because, well, I thought Costa Rica is a pretty good country
oh, yes, eh
You didn't see poverty on the streets, and I don't know
yes, yes, well, Puerto Rica is the most democratic country in the American continent, yes
hmm, hmm, and they don't have an army ,right
they don't have an army and their whole politics, in Costa Rica is the most, the most peaceful of all
hmmmjajaja, hmm, yes yes
I'm telling you the truth, a map there near the United States, there they have a different party, and every party one year you're in the government, or two or three years in government, and then comes another party and they do great
yeah, yeah
no army, and no, nothing of that that the government has to use force, you know what I mean
yeah, yeah, that's great, yes
ah, but many people don't know, but in Panama we have more business, are more developed
ah, sure, sure, hm
because of the Panama Canal, there are people from all over the world there, in Panama there are people from all over the world, there are many people who go there
Mja
Working with boats, with big boats, like they say, 'junk ship left with the boat' right, and if they wanted to stay they would stay in panama.
haha, of course, ha
And they don't go back to their countries so thre is actually a lot of people that cant get out, when they're working in the ship
haha,haha look
when they come to panama, you know what they say, leave the boat, and they mix themselves with the people from panama
yeah, whats the population in panama? in the whole country
Like three million people, yeah the whole country.
four, three that's it, wow thats small, very small
yeah its a small country, but its good with business.
Wow that's small haha
Yes very small only three thousand peses, three thousand people, oh wait not three thousand, three million, sorry
oh oh oh oh oh oh, OK ok ok ok, three thousand, is smaller than my small town, three million is small aswell, i knew it was three million.
no three thousand, three thousand, no no that's right, because i had a friend in new york, and she was in the library, doing business.
ok,ok,ok,ok,ok
A business library, and i found the yellow pages from spain, the yellow pages is the book with the phone numbers in it
yeah yeah yeah, the yellow pages. yeah yeah yeah yeah mmm
Yellow right, yellow, from spain, wasn't as big as the one from Brooklyn and brookyln is a small part of the united states, in the city of Mexico there's only five boroughs, right
yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah but there is a lot of people.
Brooklyn was on of the borough, an the entire Spanish page wasnt,
mja mja and you have been here for a lot of years
yes yes about thirty years but but if I have more than thirty years here if if I have a lot of years here and I'm more American than Latin
yes, no no one can notice by the accent when you speak english, when you speak English I mean
very good also, it all depends on the person and
mja mja, of course, mja mja mja
the education and also the people with whom you are all the time, understand it because if you have gone to college or something like that you still keep talking in a certain way, understand, because I'm going to tell you the truth
mja, mja
Oh I have a teacher, a teacher here from right I went to a Brooklyn College she was the... a teacher of a Spanish teacher, who teaches spanish
mja, mja
but her class was Spanish literature, get it, like Don Quijote, Lazarillo de Torme and all that
Oh yes I do remember from when I went to the institute
and I don't remember Lazarillo de Torme the first, the first kinky novel
mja mja, mja
the thing is that she is the worst teacher I have ever had in my whole life and she learned Spanish from a book not speaking in her house
OK ok ok ok it's very different it's very different yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
like the machine, the machine that you heard but she speaks better than the machine. See but she knew Spanish very well since she had to study a lot of Spain of when the moors where involved and all that
mja
she had to visit some like it is said in New york we have a right museum
mja, oh yes which museum is this, yes
where a lot of Spanish architecture is tought, they see the influences that the moors have had in the influence of Spain and we have several words like the word maybe (ojalá) is Arab yes
I hope there are many, there are many Arab words in Spanish, they are not
yes because when they tell you things I wish that we would go to the movies tomorrow and that's the movie, right
aha, sure, sure, I hadn't fell once, aha aha
I hope but I'm telling you, I hope that Allah, the God, he understand but that's a different thing. Speaking about those telemarketing and spam you say you don't get lots of that?
I don't get lots of calls or papers but I do get a lot of emails, emails, yes I get lots of emails
no, no, email right oh please, oh believe me, I get a lot because I use Yahoo, which one do you have?
well, I have several, I have Hotmail, gmail, I have the one from my American college, the one from my university in Spain, I mean
oh please
I spend my day looking at many different emails, it sucks, yes, yes
and it's not just horrible but that people, how do you say it in English, right, I'm saying it, I'm telling you, they practically are, they are pretty creative
how, how, how, aha, yes
they know how to write stuff that you are going to want to read
and
so, they say things that you are probably going to read and make you look inside and I tell you, they are really, how can I say it
yes, they have imagination, no, they are creative
imagination, yes, they are imaginative
and I get one once a week, I get one in French
aha
that says, it says that an old widow of an African dictator has died and has left I don't know how many millions
ohhh oh millions oh oh no oh
and he is asking for help to make those millions and that he and as well
ah no oh and look they have accumulated much in the past six months
yes yes yes yes
it has risen sharply Previous says that I won something in England and I have to go to England to claim my doólares pesos or what they have and that oh so dejate
oh yes yes I also asked if anyone really believe these stories it is not.
but they say yes yes
because I know it seems incredible that someone could bite is as if someone sent someone not sting
but see they send, they send a lot of that other country and sent two thousand right two million.
yes of course
and hope that one or two people, you understand me
Yes today does not cost any effort to send an email to millions of people and I do not know whether it seems to me incredible that someone could bite
other incredible eh say a I say that if the Lord has like fifty thousand dollars if you do not answer
yes yes some history, some amazing stories
fifty thousand, fifty million and did not tell and I who are crazy and many countries are saying and many say they are from Nigeria, Nigeria, eh eh
Yes of Nigeria and also as I am in college organize conferences.
aha
then there are people who register for the conference and then ask you some good money to come complicated stories that sometimes people do not know if it's true or a lie or the internet with it.
oh
sometimes do not know is you're talking to someone for real or are you completely kidding, it's ...
and the thing but eh I do not think the government could, as you can you can not know who is sending the person, who is what you are doing that.
ah yes, it is tricky because it's so easy to hide your identity no
itself and also the thing that when they send all those letters if eh, it's hard when it says it's good you know what they're trying to get yours Chabas, understand the money but
mm

I'm Pilar.
What's your name?
Pil Pilar
Pilar, and where, where are you from?
From Spain
Ah, look Eh, And where are you right now?
In New York
Ah, look, what part of New York?
Yes um
In what part of New York?
Ah, In what part of Madrid, eh, oh, in Manhattan?
To in
But well we have to talk, we are deviating and they are not going to pay us, the topic today is telemarketing no.
yes
And, what do you think=
yes
When they call you on the phone to try and sell you something.
I don't like it.
Not at all of course
And you? uh
I don't know anyone who, who, who likes it, in fact.  I don't know anyone who has ever bought anything via, via telephone.
yes, me neither, me neither, I think that it is always an annoyance.  I mean more than anything
But let's go, I believe that, someone must buy from them because otherwise
yes it must be, I mean they mast make money with that because otherwise, they wouldn't do it.
yes, Of course but they must make very little because I
I mean
I have never heard anyone who is not bothered by it, I even think it causes more damage
Um
because it is like negative publicity for them.
How?
Because if they are calling people to their home and they are bothering them.
um
well the people are not giving a god opinion basically no
no no, there must be people who sometimes I think that people are alone.  Like maybe older people.  If they are alone and,
and like they, they like talking
yes well yes
They could like start to talk, plus sometimes.  Older people like that, like they are more confused like they can
they can convince you to sell them something
they can convince them a little more.
yes unfortunately
But I believe that the majority of young people, now I don't know, I don't know, there must be also young people who can be convinced but, I believe that people are very busy, they don't want to waste their time in
in having a conversation like that.
Of course, of course.  And, and spam too,
Ah I mean they are in my email all the spam goes to a different folder
Of course
the email does that like automatically
And it, it is less bothersome then no.
yes like that, I don't even see it, I don't even open that folder, like it is always there.  And And it is, the place by itself eliminates it after, thirty days or something like that.
And no, you never check to see.
Almost never, sometimes yes, sometimes I go and watch, but. Already because they arrive in the hundred. Or, for example there should be about two hundred fifty and no so I get bored watching it
I, yes, I look through it, every time that I enter I look at the spam mail because sometimes something passes through there that isn't spam
Um, yes
He has gone to the spam folder but, most people do not look through and what has happened to me is that I write something to someone
And they don't reply, no reply
perhaps in the spam
And it was because it had gone to the spam folder and not because they had seen it before deleting it, understand?
Clearly
I look at them, but rarely, and almost always it's okay, it's almost always just spam in the spam folder
Yes
And no spam arrives in my inbox
How nice, how nice. What service do you use?
Excuse me?
What email do you use?
I have various accounts. I have Yahoo and Hotmail, I've got various ones. Y yes it's good because the spam is very protected, and a virus cannot enter
Yes, good, I never open the spam emails but I look through the list in order to see if someone, if another person has called, but no.
I don't open them because I believe that
No, but yes, but including sometimes you can get email from people that you know but they are still viruses.
Um, yes
And that also does not allow you to open them, it's good
yes that is they say sure i do not know if that really happens I THINK WE have to open the email also the attachment like one
the what
one archive, we need to open also something they send together with email
yes
because yes do not not believe, that can send a virus, by simply sending an email
No the yes um have to download all the archives, but that is what you can not do hotmail,it soes not let you download the archive
ya yes better
Because the truth is that it has many tricks, the email those of virus and many times looks like yes,yes one person that you know that is sending something that interests you.
um
and is is a virus, O is that have to be very careful and the the ones that send commercials through the internet, or the the people that are sending spam they are really selling things
yes yes
Me is because I do not understand that, who buys from them.
yes they sell and also o be like pornographic things
yes is mostly all the time
do not know pills.
yes all the illegal stuff they sell that is fo-that is way
hu
eh pills that are not approved,that di-promise miracles and people believe it is that I do not understand.
uh
who believes that
Well there must be people I don't know I think there are people I mean that let themselves be fooled by those things, like they let themselves
yes sure
I don't know, I know a woman, that, that yes, there are some emails that talk about About someone, I don't know how they are like emails that say that someone from the government
needs help and that that if one puts money in eh, they'll give you the money back plus I don't know ten times more, something like that, and I do know a woman
I do bite
that yes, I mean, and that she always believes it and that she, isn't so good. It's as if she's a bit a bit crazy or something, but she always believes it.
(She) Always believes it and (she) has lost a pile of money.
Well it's very dangerous That is very dangerous, because there are a lot of people who have lost a lot of money that way.
yes yes it is true that that, that is I mean selling things, as such I think that a lot of people don't buy it, but they tell you.
that one's going to win money I mean, yes that one that that one sends money and they'll send you much more, I think that there are people who dream about that.
yes that is, that is there are people who bite.
like that
That is already a lack of, of intelligence, that's already a lack of I mean of really thinking, because, they're going to give me free money, and how is it that I alone got it from all the people in the world with email and ?
Sure sure, sure. But there are always people who think so.
yes
They are the only ones in the world who are going to win with that. I mean, there are people that like want to dream about that.
Sure
It's li- like gambling, I mean. there are people who gamble and they think they're going to win a lot of money even though everyone loses money with that.
yes, practically, if not the Bank, if not the casino wouldn't exist
Sure, sure But there's always people who will gamble and think that they will become rich.
yes
And so, so with betting some few of course win money, there must be a someone, But few
The ones who go to have fun for a day, the ones who go because they don't have an addiction, and the ones who are dedicated professionally to play. Because there are some games, i think there is a game, it's the black jack
Of course
in which you have the probabilities, if you play god of make money
Of sourse, or the Poker also a little bit, or not
i don't know
yes the poker i think you have like
I think it's going but i suppose that
the poker it's like psychological, because you have to pretend that you has more than you really have or less than you have, i don't know
is like a whole game of
well in the poker i know, i saw a documentary with the people of the MIT that they have their tricks to count cards, which is ilegal, of course, the casino it´s too clever, for one thing that you can do for beat the casino, they prohibited it
of course um
And it's no a cheating really, a cheat could be, have mark in the cards
Of course, no, no this is like
cards under the sleeve, but if you're capable of counting cards Why is that going to be cheating? So they were from Casino to casino so they were not to be caught
Of course
winning a little bit in each one, not winning too much in each casino to not attrac attention, but they were caught and they were forbiden the entrance to the casinos
ja, look
and they had to go to Europe to win in the European casinos
ha
i was just curious.
look
but but, if nobody
but i think its good that people can win because people loose money, their should be some that should win.
that true, nobody justs gives away money. people want too believe it.
um
its, its rare that somebody would give you something. they always look for something in return, and you've put your number.
yeah, i subscribed
and does it work?
its the same thing, sometimes they call me, but a lot less, less than before, and they take time to start working. it takes a few months.
and then one can see it, they tell you and tell you we will put you on the list, and the list starts in three or four months.
but then you find out there's a lot less calls.
good
but there's always somebody that calls, i don't know
the bad thing about the list, is that is not obligatory, it should be, so you can put your number on the list, so they cant call you.
um
but i don't know, simply, its a list for companies that dont want to bother on calling other people.
um
that say they don't want them to call because its wa waste of money and time.
um
If there are other companies don't mind for them and they try it just in case, y all the possible ways
of course
are those that do not look at the lists. And they call you and make you waste your time
yes, I think not all the companies like ...
And they lose money
they take attention to the list, or not all have the list, I don't know, who have that list
hu
maybe is less, I don't know if you put your name there, but your number there ...
I know, if ...
But they call you anyway
I don't like anyone, but I'm lucky, my telephone was new
um
In January I put my telephone on the list, and the phone I have received were of the companies when I have one service
oh, sounds good
they want to sell me more services
um
That's also very annoying
um
But,next time they call me, they call me of the same bank
um um
they have called me a few times about the same thing, next time I'm going to tell them to please put me in their bank's list
of no calling
Sure, sure
I mean they must have a list like that, because you're one of their clients, I mean
sure
If one of their clients tells them not to call anymore they would be dumb to keep on calling because the client can get mad and leave
Sure
so I'm going to try it to see if those annoying people from the bank stop calling because, besides is that they always want to sell me the same thing and I've told them no because they want to sell it to me again.
um sure
They think one day I'm going to say yes, because they insist a lot is that I don't understand them
um
Hello
Hello
yes
this is Tammy
Alex
Alex again, how are you?
fine
I thing not so many people makes this survey
No, i don't think so
Because I have talked to you like three of four times
Well, we are going to get paid
and somebody else, two or three
yes
it's not our fault that there wasn't enough people in this survey
Yes, it's the same
It's funny
I'm always here at this time
I almost made this earlier, but i couldn't so I said I was calling later, but I forgot it and then
I always call at 9 o'clock, and it is 9 o'clock
yes
Okay what do you think about telemarketing
There are still I think the same, some I like others no. So, that and here all the time I get in the mail, today I got three.
again for about refinancing my house I say no, those people don't let it go.
sometimes there are good offers.
yes
I like the marketing more by mail. because it's not so, ah, how do I tell you? it's more private and one can look at the offer without the pressure of the
of the call.
yes hat is, that is true too true.
And sometimes sa-, good deals come out, and I don't put in everything that I receive.
mhm, I always check them.
I, I, I look at the things sometimes.
yes because, mm well there are some as I one says one can find something good if you look, but on the phone I don't like that.
Well, everything in life is a risk, I no no, I think that there are many things that are a risk, everything is a risk. Sometimes you're going to win and other times you're going to lose, true.
yes
The problem is when it's bothering you at an inopportune time. or when they are taking advantage of a person.
and sometimes they call me very early, that supposedly they can't call until after eight o'clock. they call me before eight, but I don't answer
yes really it's not important to me. that usually I don't answer the calls
yes I'm set
yes I know that it's telemarketing
yes I've got the Caller ID set up depending, if I don't know who it is then I hope that the answering machine picks up, if I know the voice, then I pick up.
yes
sometimes yes, sometimes if I get the phone and say ah, I already know who it is and say, no thank you, no thanks. Oh, sometimes I pretend like I don't speak English.
so they leave me alone I don't speak English,
And they, they call you in English or Spanish.
in English
Never in Spanish.
No, they haven't called me in Spanish only in English.
And because here, here since there are so many Hispanic people in Los Angeles sometimes they call in Spanish.
yes not here, here they haven't started yes, well. That's what I have to say.
well I think that you are the only person that speaks Spanish in Seattle
no there are many here.
According to the Fisher survey.
you have to see because here there are many, there are many  Mexicans here.
yes
no there's a lot, there's Panamanians but I don't know many and
but they don't do marketing in Spanish.
no no, nobody has called me, that I know other people I don't know but they haven't called me.
and the other thing that bothers me, sometimes, there's too much marketing spam on the computer
oh yes
there's a lot of that, that should be more controlled by the law.
I got into my, into email today and I had ninety-seven.
because sometimes I have a special email to filter
uh huh
and sometimes I have a thousand emails there only telemarketing
if it's true
and I have to throw them away, I have that you take ten or fifteen minutes to throw them away. When I could be doing something more important
too much, it's that too much of the stuff they send you one doesn't even ask for it. my husband was laughing yesterday because he got a letter from a telemarketing about some nude beaches of nudes, and I was laughing
yes wow
angrier, he says. Where, where they I'm from? and I was laughing.
That is incredible.
had it was funny because he had all the letters in his hand, but that one they sent him, that If you see it from the outside, I don't know-, it doesn't say what it is.
he had it in the, in the jacket so that no one saw it. I say who's going to see it, who's going to start seeing your stuff. I was laughing
you, Why do they always send that? I say, I don't know, I don't know.
But sometimes good things come up, about a year ago. it came up for a thing to see a show here nearby
uh huh
and I won a ticket to Las Vegas and some tickets to Disneyland
ah
and I didn't spend anything
That's good. uh huh
there are, there are times when good things come up from marketing
But we have to be careful, when someone is involved.
yes, we have to be careful, specially because of the computer and because of internet banking, sometimes its a scam.
mhm
I have a friend that got scammed, while marketing, using a credit card.
ha
And they took his money from the the bank, because he gave it away.
Hay mhm
And they charged him like 200 dollars just to apply for the credit card.
I remember, when i went to see my lawyer, i said a girl crying in the office, the secretary, was crying, and i said, why are you crying? and she responded, no that,
one of those telemarketing things have taken five hundred dollars from my account.
yeah, why
first one hundred fifty dollars, then the lawyer that she was working for told her he was going to help her,
this actually happenes a lot, you should never do that, never give it out your information, to a telemarketing agency.
no, people don't think about that.
Because its actually a legal robbery.
When, i buy things off of the internet, me and my husband have a special card we put on money on it when we buy things on the internet.
so, if we are going to spend sixty dollars, that's all i put on it. so yeah.
And something else that has been
what
uh, um, i have received cards, that have to be send to the united states of america.
Exactly, Me too.
and they want their bank account to do their transaction. I believe this is a trick so that way you don´t get anything. They are going to take away all the money you have in the bank.
I heard about the news, they arrested some government people in a city of Africa.
Yes, It gets out of Africa.
they were, mm
And I am from great britain, I researched a company that made me an offer to work for them and they would pay me a lot of money.
Ok.
It came to be a fake company.
Yes. I
They wanted to clear my bank account.
Yes i don't mess with those people They have even call me to Canada. They try to make me buy their products.
Lottery Tickets.
mhm
In Canada, I believe, What for? I didn't buy lottery tickets over here, I don´t want to participate in the Canadian lottery.
Yes
No, they say you would be rich, I say no thanks.
Yes, they always say that.
Yeah, that's right, My son's girlfriend received a card that mentioned she had won pair of earrings.
Made out of diamond, a watch, and money. She was supposed to send two hundred dollars in order to get her prize.
Yes
and she tells me, because she only has eighteen years old, I tell her, do not get involved like a mad woman to be bossing around anything.
And, and also many times it has happened to me that I have won things on the compute
hmm
but I have to do the survey, and in the survy- survey I have to buy something.
yes
and, I already know that it is a scam, because one gives one's name, one's address and one's phone number.
hmm
and then they want more, they want one to buy something.
aha, yes
then I never do it and I have never received anything.  to me I have never received anything, it is like a marketing
yes,
there should be laws against that cheat.
yes because any person, there are persons that are like that, that it is easy for them to get involved in things like that, when they say that there is something that is free.  I tell you, when it is free
Free or, or that you have won something.
hmm my husband always tells me when it is something like that he reads everything, the small print on the bottom, read it well, well because they can come out with something, that you have to pay something,
so it is difficult after you signed, to come out with something, like that
that is what is called in Spanish I think a hook
hmm so there has to, I always tell that to my sister and my children
and there is much of that happen in Spain too
you read everything i don't have get anything in spanish, yet
you are going to receive it in these days
i tell you with me the people don't even think that i am latina when they come to see me so i do that too, so if you now have that
you can call to take off the marketing of you're phone that's good too
yes that would be good
but i don't know, i probably can ask to my husband he knows, because it says that is free, you put your phone number, and your name and they get you out of
the list that they have, because there are some people that you tell and they keep calling
i think that they are going to keep calling because they do the calls spontaneosly, so they are not, but how they know your name too, if they are doing it spontaneously
because
how are they going to know your name
because they buy the names, the names list
mmm
and sometimes they go like once they said to me they go for each number, one two three four five, they don't know the my phone number but
they go exactly, almost, one two three four five, numbers like that they mark directly
yes
so its that easy for them for not lose anything why they are doing it in order
then i think we are agree, the best marketing goes out from the mail
mmm
or newspapers
Good evening. Mildred, of Connecticut
Ah, good evening, Mercedes speak, of Philadelphia
How are you?
Nice to meet you. Good. Let's see, we have to talk politics.
Aha.
We think? That, to me, is a bit difficult issue, because I do not wear much, well, I have, if, as six years living here, but never, as not voting, it never interested me enough for that is the policy of
And you can not vote because you have not registered, or because they want?
Because I am not a citizen yet.
Oh, okay.
I'm just, ah, resident. So I can not yet vote, and
But residents do not vote. I thought they
No, no, no I don't vote. We don't vote. One has to be, uh, citizens, to vote. You if you vote? Ever voted?
Yes, I always vote.
Ah.
I had a time I thought, well, she said, oh, I will not vote. For what? But, ah, after me, wrapped me working with one of the parties. Then I realized that yes, we need to vote, especially Hispanics
for us to hear our voice and our vote there, that counts.
yes, And you think of the Democrats or the Republicans and the differences between them?
Well, look, I vote for my party. But sometimes, when I like a candidate from another party, vote for too.
Mhm.
Not me, as they say? I am not a fan of in truth, not because, they say, then, Pure. Be pure idealist that game? but
when I see that a candidate is going to do something good for my community or for the state, then, I do vote for him, even if he is from another.
And, I vote for all other candidates that, that my party has.  But, no, I mean, no, I don't try to, how do you say it?
Only with the line of the pol- of the party.
aha, aha
Ah, OK, OK, OK.  Ah, and from the, let's say, of what people well what people, the eh, the conception of that the, eh, democrats are more liberal and that the republicans are a little more
conservative.  What do you think about? Conservatives.  What do you think about that?
yes, but I believe that they are little more, more conservative regarding some aspects.  But, in other things, well, sometimes they go overboard.
yes.
Yeah.  Because of that, I believe that it is like no, no, they don't stay long in, in power, because they let themselves like, like, like they get scared.  After they get into things, like they,
they get scared, and they go back, or they stay
yes, what I think, also, is that, eh, maybe like that, eh, ah, ah, they are not much of, of being, in the middle.  Right? but of
they are on one side, well.  They are like very ex- no very extreme, but they have the extremes.  I believe that's why
But, the fact of being conservative indicates that, that you now, they stay on the margin of certain things they don't want to pass.  Because, they follow too much the
the matters of ethics, and matters of, of, of politics, you know.  They follow too much, I think, that, the concepts.  Democrats, well, what they see that they go to
still, still that people are on them, well, they immediately go, you know, they do it.  Even though the whole world is on top of them saying no, that they don't want what they are
placing.  But, really, well, I don't know.  In my, in my country, at least, democrats, this, have, they had control for, like for twenty-eight years
Mmh.
And, after those twenty-eight years that the leader died, who was the strong leader of that party, well, then, it has been, you know, some years they vote democratic
others, the next four years they vote republican, and they come back again the democrats, and they come back and place republicans, depending.  It depends on them of, of, of how they see the country's situation.  If they see that the country, in those four years they didn't do anything, well, they take the person out quickly.
So here, it is like that, eh and it is like that here too.  But, sometimes, that, eh, is, my country is like that, I say also.  But, sometimes it is not too much, eh, eh, I would like that they realized that maybe it is a matter with the person, not so much the party.
Right, right
¿Right?, or, uh, another thing, i don't know, because also, uh, it's on the other side of
Yes. I think to, but yeah, a candidate, uh, if a, if a party has a good candidate and, and like, because, look, this man who ruled over Puerto Rico, it was Luis Muños Marin
He ruled for twenty eight years. He did a lot of good things, you know, he brought a lot of progress to the country, he brought things that, well, when the country was late, well, he moved it forward.
Um
So, well, he, he maintained control, so, of all people. And, after he, he died, many of the generations that stayed, i mean, they still
Even though he was dead, they still followed his ideals. They didn't follow, really, uh, they didn't see that, what were they doing, it was like, since they were
The popular party that's democrat, well, that's the one tat they choose to be their, ¿how do you say it?, their leader. But, it wasn't really about, because they saw something good was being done.
Um
And i don't think it should be like that, ¿do you understand?, i think that if a candidate, well, you see he could be better, well, give him a chance
But, sometimes, uh, what i wanted to say too, is that there's people that's like too much towards the party, ¿right?
Uh, and that don't care
You're thinking of fanatics
Yes. I mean, that they don't, maybe the candidate doesn't have the charity, ¿right?, but, since they vote for his party, uh, that's what i, sometimes, uh, i don't like. But also, at the same time.
Uh, there's people that also goes for, not only the qualifications, uh, intellectual, or the candidate's abilities, but his personal charm.
Right, right.
That happens a lot in my country, that's right, uh, people lets, they fall in love, like they say.
Yeah, for a face, for a face and a
Uh, uh, and for what, eh, yeah. About the life, i don't know, about the impression he gave them, maybe not about, uh
About some gestures, but
your resume, or your curriculum. Right? It's what you can or cannot do.
Well, but, ah, almost always, all the politicians promise, I do this, I to, I do, I do, and when they arrive, they forget of what they had to do.
Or, or maybe they don't forget, maybe they find a lot of, a lot of opposition. Because, specially when the party that wins is the, the Democrats, and,
and the Republicans win most of Congress, well, then it's much more difficult the task he has. Well, they won't approve all the laws that they want, and they won't approve all the things that he said that he wanted to do, do you understand?
Mhm.
And, since they're majority, and the ones that go to, to vote and make the decision, well, many times, I find it that it's difficult for him,
a leader that, that is good, but the rest of his party doesn't win, well, it's very difficult, you know, eh, the, em- em- em-
to do all the best that he wants in favor of the community.
Mhm.
Because, then, the other ones don't give him a chance
Mhm.
i think that, depending on, on, you know, if, if, let's suppose, if a democrat wins, and almost all are democrats,
yes.
but when a democrat wins, and all the other ones are Republican, the make his life difi-
And, and that is something that looks to me counterproductive. Right? Because one would think that when all is, one wishes, maybe, an ideal world that once in power, all would work for the well being of, of everyone.
but, some also work for their own benefit, not for the benefit, right, of the community
Exactly, exactly. And, that's why, let's say, for example, here, as it's divided, when they pass laws, Right? that first congress, then the senate, and then the president. Right?
But, usually, many laws come because they are initiatives from the president. Right? But, they have to pass the test in the senate, and, if the senate is of
the party co- the majority is for the other party, it's a big problem. I mean, it's good, I think that is good because ah, em,
it makes it so there is so- control. Right? In, eh, balance between the two parties. Right? But at the same time, like it slows down the, things, and mayb- like, lik- of, more bureaucracy, it's what I want to say.
Aha, aha, yes, more bureaucracy, I-
yes.
what happens. So, fight and problems start and
And, one other thing, I've read that here in the United States, for example, I mean, a lot of laws, President's initiatives, right?
But, usually they do them like a group. Right? about, eh, about initiatives in a single document, for example. Right? Because, as they submit them once,
to, to, to the senate. For example, one day, and they put as addendum or additions. Right? to the law, that this other law, this other law, maybe people don't support these others, but they do support the main one.
But, as the other ones were attached to this one, they don't approve it. Then, they say, no. No we don't approve it because, because of it. Right? And, maybe, the main idea was the one everybody agreed, but, now
they have to start all over again
yeah. That's why I tell you that when, when they don't belong to the same party, there are always a lot of problems. Then, some people want one thing and other something else.
Mhm.
So, no, we never know what they are going to, really, to me, I, in politics, well, I'll tell you, how I got involved
after I got here, about, about four years ago, that I began to participate, to take more action in the, because I saw that, they didn't want to approve a lot of things for Hispanics
that they were not treating us very well. So, I got involved in, in politics. But, it's also a lot of bickering and they take out, they air all your dirty laundry, you know.
Mm, mm
Everything they can air about you to find something, if you go to, to any position, forget it, they investigate your family and they air, if you sell this, if you had that, if your son did this, if your aunt is, was that.
So, that's what I don't like. I said, no, I can't be involved in this thing.
Mm, mm
So, I keep working, and I help them, but I don't, I didn't get involved, you know, to run anyway. I have nothing to be ashamed , but I don't like the
And specially, I find that the white people, here, try to, to manipulate a lot and to control a lot.
Mm
specially in the Republican party. The democrats are a little more, they have a little more of,
yes.
of, of this, for the Hispanics, but Republicans are kind of racists. They only do things for them, for them.
yes, yes, true. I agree with that, I do. That, maybe because they are, I don't know,
Hello?
Hi
Hi, I'm Nicole, I'm talking from New York
I'm Laia, from Philadelphia
Hi, How are you?
Fine, and you?
Fine
Really good
Ehm
Well, we have to talk about politics, right?
Politics, we spoke before, right?
what?
I think we spoke before
really?
I think so, are you from Spain?
Yes, we have talk before!, oh nice
Before we talked abuout you being a student in a local university, right?
I'm studying at University of Pennsylvania, here at Philadelphia
Oh, I remember, well, let's talk about politics
Yes, okay, very well
what do you think, how, how, a student from another country thinks about the politics here?
Um, here, well, I'm surprised, no, the fact that there are only two big parties , that people, only have two options, because,  well, in Spain is really
Um
Even, a little chaotic no, because there is
Um
there are a lot of options, then
Right
Um, you have more conservative parties, center, ecologists, more leftist, then
Um, Um
For example, I'm from Barcelona, then, think, there there are parties more catalonians, less, I don't know, then
Right
The options more or less bi-, I mean, more or less big, you have up to six more or less, and then, if you start counting the small parties, you can have up to twenty.
Um, look
but those that have, then, representation in the parliament normally, um, just six parties, then
Look, look
Instead here, is just one, I'm surprised no, that's it, then, black or white.
Sure
And, and
Sure, sure, and sometimes they are not that different
yes, that's the problem, also, that's the problem. Well, because if there was
Grey and gray. Bad and worse.
exactly, exactly, yes, yes, yes, yes, it's not that different, you can, you can feel a little underrepresented, no, almost
yes. Um, yes, yes, there are some small parties that have a really different perspective but they don't have
Um, um. Um, um.
they don't have enough support.
Sure.
And they don't have enough money.
Um, um. Um, um.
em, so, there are really only two parties.
Um, um. Um, um.
I mean, when, I mean, we always have elections but when you go to vote, they include the small parties in the ballot and eh, when you vote, but they get a minimal percentage of that vote.
Um, um. Um, um. Um, um. Um, um, sure.
I think that just once, in the history of the Presidential elections, one candidate, a, a, a, a man represented an independent party.
Um, um
He is Ross Perot, eh.
How, what's his name?
Perot? P-E-R-O-T
Oh, okay, yes, yes, yes, he was a man, um
That was many years ago, I mean, he did win lots, lots of votes but
yes. Um.
not enough as something to earn, but
Um, um. Um, um. Um, Um.
I don't know, he was a very, very rich man.
Yes, no, he was a multimillionaire, yes.
Right. It's, um, he could be an idealistic person, or from another perspective, usually can't.
yes, yes, right, but I don't know, there was, in the end, there was one
He can't.
Nader, or Naser, or, or, or something like that, Ral- Ralph, um.
Um. Ah, yes, Nader, Nader, yes. He is too.
But, of course, to vote for him is a little but like throwing your vote in the trash, right, because you know that, really, it's not going to come to anything.
Right. Right. It isn't, or rather, it's for, it's like for saying something symbolic.
Um, yes, yes, yes.
But not really to vote for him, because no, he's not going to win, you know that.
yes. Um, um. Um, um.
eh, he has a lot of ideas, very, very good ideas, in my, in my opinion, but
Uh, uh.
I wouldn't vote for him simply because it matters a lot to me who
Of course, of course.
who is really going to be president.
Right, the, the thing about Spain is, ah, if you vote, I don't know, well, you vote for a party that's very small.
um
but then, after that, it is important, because you know with the alliances that get established, if none of the parties have the maximum control of the votes then a small party really can be decisive and very important to devide who governs, that, well, has happened many times
Of course. um
in history then, that is, it is not a question to say, ah, since it is a small party then i will not vote for it because it is not going to serve any purpose because it is
it can really serve, but of course in this system we have here, it really is a
of course
one or another, no?
no, it is always Republicans and Democrats, always
yes, yes, yes, yes
of course
um
and, since the beginning of times it has been this way, that is many years ago there were other parties, but
um, um. Um, um
yes at least, the last one hundred years
of course
it has been this way
of course, and it takes a lot of effort to break this this dynamic, and also
um
well, with all the money that is needed, no, to run, and the campaigns, and
um. yes, and think that people in, in Spain, or what do you think? of Of, of the things that have happened here, with the elections
so close, and counting the votes and all that mess?
Ah, yes, yes, well I remember the first to win was Bush. Actually people were very surprised it was not the first complication with this voting system, with no loopholes and such
Um. Um. Yes.
there really was, so there was no confusion, in which
Um.
it should, therefore, be the largest stable democracy, but it's not
sure, sure, it's like the only one
but
it is this country, who should send people to other countries to monitor elections, to see that they are legal
Exactly, exactly, exactly.
and, at the same time, and our own choice is something so complicated and difficult to understand
yes, yes, yes.
and really, in the end, it is the last election of the year
Two thousand.
I mean, that was in the year two thousand
yes.
this election, near the end, was almost like they were being paid
yes, it was very very strange
for connections, because Bush, Bush's brother, eh it was the
Um, um.
the governor of, of Florida, is like, like everything was a thing of, as if it was
yes, yes.
As if it was happening in a different place.
yes, I was very surprised that, that Al Gore that insist any more, uh, did not, not protest more, no, because everything was so, so weird, so dark, that
Um, yes, yes.
That I don't know, I was surprised that they retired so soon, that I don't know, well, well I don't, don't, understand that.
Uh,
uh. uh, well.
yes, yes me too. I also see it like that, like, like is going, is going to say, already,
Hm, yes, and I guess things would have gone much, uh, different, right
uh, um. Um.
but, well, eh, yes.
yes, yes, there would be another, another story, now, or rather
yes, yes, yes,
I imagine, five years later
um, um
all the things that  have happened.
And nothing, the, and the last ones also, were a little, well, I don't know, I felt sad because I really thought there would be a change, no, and the people.
uh, yes, me too, me too. The last time, really
there would
the first time, it felt much, much anger, I, like, like people really
Um, um.  Um, um.
The majority voted for Gore, and still they installed Bush, and I was outraged, and the second time, I felt sadness.
Um, um.  Um, um.  Um, um.  Um, um.  yes, yes, yes.
Because people voted for Bush
yes, yes, yes, yes.  I mean the second time it is undisputed, I mean, um.
how were they, how could they vote for him again, after all that had happened.
Um.
I thought, what country is this, I mean, who was voting?
Uh, uh. yes, yes.
I don't know, I don't know
Because, you can vote, here.
Of course, well I voted, but
You, you vote I mean, you, you are an American citizen, I mean
yes, yes, yes, yes, I ama citizen.  I mean, I was born here.
Of course, um, um.  Um, um.  OK, OK, OK
Well yes, but I don't know, the system really has to send, I believe
Um, um, um.
Because, well, well, the government has to change too.  ut the system of voting is very
Um.
it's very unfair, because they go by state
um, um. Um.
it shouldn't be like that, it should be, the majority wins.
Sure.
Point.
Sure. yes, yes, yes.
Or rather, why go by states, that gives a lot of power to the smaller states.
Um. Um, um. Um, um. Sure. Sure. yes, yes. At least, a good thing that you have, it there are only two terms per President no, at least the next time, well, as bad as Bush, but, well, I doubt it right?
Um, um.
yes, there. that was alright, because in Spain no, no there's no limit.
Um/
And I don't know if it would remain it power for years, and years, and years.
Sure.
And well, also it's good that they revel
Sure. yes. yes, yes, I agree with that, because every eight years, it's eight years, or rather that, it's, ah, it's quite a long time
Sure, no, even though eight, although eight yes, they've already been to do quite a bit, yes yes yes
We'll see what happens next, I don't know.
yes, you know whose going to be the democratic candidate?
No, still no. It's very, it's still very early, and that's because
yes, yes, yes.
It will happen in the year two thousand.
In two thousand, in the eight,
eight, I mean, the campaign will already start in two thousand seven, I mean, in two more years
Um, um.  Um, um.
Eh, but, until now, no, we don't know
But I don't think that Kerry will run again, no?
No.
I mean
No, Kerry, really was not, he was not a very strong candidate
Um, um.
really Democrats need someone more charismatic, like with more personality
Um.
with more, with a clearer message for people
Um, um. Um, um.
to see that, nowadays, I don't know how it used to be, but nowadays, you need you need in politics to have a much clearer message for people, because people
Of course, OK.
gets confused quickly, and like they don't don't pay much attention, like they don't have much interest
Um, um.  Um, um.  Um, um.
So you have to have a message like that, simple.
yes, yes.  Sometimes they stay with the surface, a little, no, and, they start to have, well
well of course, and people believe, whatever they hear, but they believe things that are simple and clear.
Um, um.
Like people don't want to hear a lot with- a lot of, explanation, things that are too complicated, like you lose them.
Um, um. Um.
It is like you have to say things in a very direct form and in a way that is easy to understand like, like without too many doubts.
yes, yes, yes.
and I think that Kerry was like too intelligent perhaps
OK, he had like an air like, pedantic, no, sometimes, of knowing too much.
Um.  Um.
And perhaps that.  I saw him a couple of times when he came here to Philadelphia, to do a pair of meetings.
Um.
And, to, to me, his message was, I believe he said intelligent things, but that he didn't, he didn't finish reaching people, he didn't finish
Um.
that, of having enough charisma.
yes, yes.  And Gore was even worse.  That Gore was like an intellectual
Um, um.  OK, OK.
that people couldn't listen to him.
OK, OK, OK, OK.
I didn't understand him, I felt he was distant, strange, cold.
Um, um.  Also the opposite, no, it is like, or appears to be, like one more, an uncle, well, I am like all of you, yes
of course. of course. of course, a neighbor. The man who lives, in the same block like one, that
yes,yes,yes. yes, that is the role he interprets.  As a matter of fact, because he goes to see his family, is a, well, someone who has a lot of money, and, it is a, a start, so that
of course
no, it is not ours, we say, but he is
of course.  I think he is very intelligent
N-
i believe he looks like he is quite stupid
yes, yes, yes. yes, ye. yes, yes, yes, yes
Like to convince people he is not dangerours
um, um. Um, um
like that, like he is that way
but he is opposite to that. yes, yes, yes
I believe he is intelligent, or if he is not intelligent, at least the people in his government are intelligent
um, um. Um, um
Because they have done a lot of things, no no like this, not by coincidence, it is like
um, um. um, um. um, um
None of these things have happened without a plan
of course, of course
so what
Um, and what would you think about Hillary Clinton as candidate?
Ah, I like her, ah, eh, I like her, but, I think that it is going to be difficult.
yes?
Hi, my name is Wendy.
David, hi Wendy.

Oh yes.
You live in Texas?
I mean, I had good memories there.
HOw are you?
It's not of a very good memory.
Oh, a little bit, not much. It's that I haven't talked with many people, that may be.
Already, I.
For, for
Uh, yes
Yeah, uh, I didn't speak to many people regarding the survey
Oh, yes, this is already my second time
Yeah.
Doing this.
Oh, really?
Ya.
Oh.
Twice, but I've participated in other studies as well.
Oh, Uh-huh, Okay.
But in
So you are in Arizona, how is the climate down there?
Oh, this, this was uh, at times it's difficult to understand you.
Oh, yes.

Ya, but I'm arriving at my house in like two minutes
Oh-oh
And I can probably hear better. But uh, what was the topic, religion?
what happened?
Oh, the topic, the...religion.
Oh, this is religion, yeah. Out there, eh, I have three days talking about the same story, it never changes.
Of that?
No, it never changes, the topic
Oh, I haven't talked about religion, before, only of, um, was, um, possibly politics and
Right
But, I think that, no, we didn't talk before about religion, no.
Oh, no, in those days, those, no. Now we have like four or five days that the topic is the same, of religion.
Oh, Yeah, probably yes. Yeah, then.
Yeah. And
I think it's okay
Yeah, but men, oh, people, they get angry
it
It's a bad topic, men.
Uh. Oh, yes.
And, yeah.
not for me.
No No, the people that I have talked to, comes, one comes from = LA
No I think that in God, but I am not, a God fanatic, or
right
of religion
right, yeah
But Yeah well
yeah no
I can see how it could be a very uhm, controversial topic if.
Yeah, it is very controversial because people get
What?
let me tell you they get very mad, that is the other. that not, that the
Oh really?  To you?
well well, and that no,
Why?  What pri-?
If, because
Why?  What do you think about religion that can be someone uhm, very angry?
Well, for, for, for me is tha the people, that is everybody believes in their, in their religion, no.  But there are different, different peoples,
there are different persons uhm, different parts of the world, like the Chinese, and the, the, the the Muslims the Buddhists, and the Catholics, the
Yes yes
there are different, you know because they don't have the same upbringing
oh yeah exactly, yes
then right, so then who, who is someone to say that the, the religion of one is better than the other
I'm more liberal, it's a word, liberal, on my god belief
good, but, but, the people gets very brave. you're attacking, you're attacking their religion, you know
yes
its ah
exactly, yes
it's a topic to talk about let me tell you
why is it your religion
because i am catholic too, but you know i'm, i, when i was little i was, um, my mom always took me to the church, but then when i was, when i was eighteen already, i mean, i got married, and i got married at, at the catholic church
oh yes, oh, right?
and, and, and everything, but for mi it's you know it's like so many troubles that had the, the, the hards
hmm hmm
at the catholic church, you know i mean
yes
with so many money, you put so many money, that's hard you know, everybody works hard for their money
exactly
so for, i mean, sure at the, at the, for, for a donation for the church, for the church to help the other people, the other people,
and they're helping one, one another, they help themselves because all the money the families give, for them to shut up
Hmmm.
You know, that money you know.
Yes.
And they were millions, millions of dollars.
Oh, rea, really?
NO.
It's a lot of money.
Yeah, I mean, up here where we are, as i saw, i am, I live near Massachussets.
Yes.
And all the problems were at the Massachussets, Florida and New York churches.
That they were busy with young boys.
hmmm
And, well, for about thirty years, the church knew priests had problems.
Hmm.
They paid the family so they would remain silent.
Really?
Yeah and all that moeny came out from the collection fee. All the moeny came out of the church, and there were millions and millions of dollars.
Wow.
Two hundred thousand, a hundred thousand.
How much, how much do they send?
you know
Of each person, as
It depends, I mean
Twenty percent, of their income?
Um, including the, the, the, the people who go to church?
Well, for example, I think in certain re- religions, in the bible it says that you have to, um, donate like twenty percent, I think.
No,
of, or, or ten percent of your income.
I'm sorry. Of your salary, already. But
Like tide, yea
Yeah, you tides, you do your, your tides, but the, the
Hm mm
If, if they do that. And if they investigate you. Like it's a ~WCW two let me see your, your your, your your, your paycheck
Really? Wow.
You know, you make Yea But, you can't go to church.
It's an invasion of your pri- pr - um priva, vacy.
Yeah, if
Um
But it's the same thing. I know a church that's here, But, the, the church when I was there, and it's big. And the people who go there
have priests and you know that, I mean, because the whole world has your name on the envelope, and this is not, you only gave, twenty dollars this week.
You have to give twenty two dollars. No, you win, six hundred and fifty dollars, less taxes,
Yes
you need to give the chur- to the ch- to the church, thirty and this, so much, you know and they, they wait, they expect it
Wow in, in the religion
Yes
in, in the one that I was raised,
Hm

Twenty-three, ok, you're still young. I'm forty years old.

Hm mm, exactly
You know then, one would pray more and, and it was more for the person, than for the church
Hm mm
Then, these days it is more for the church, than the, the person
Oh, yes.
You know ehm that is the key you want to go to church so that you could help the church
Exactly.
you know instead of keeping the business, this or that, that he needs help, and for everybody to go backwards, you know but, ehm, honestly,
the church is for the, for the youth, or, you know for the person
Hm mm
To help him to you know to diret him, in his, in his life you know
Yes
And, and they just want to be helped themselves, to them, to give them donations to be helped here, they want, uhm, food, they want time
